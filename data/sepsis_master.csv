41676801,Fatal Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Presenting as Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus Syndrome with Gastrointestinal Perforation: An Autopsy Case Report.,2026,"We report a rare and fatal case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) initially presenting as medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) syndrome. A 64-year-old man with a history of duodenal ulcer and hypertension presented with diplopia. Neurological examination revealed impaired adduction of the left eye with preserved convergence, consistent with MLF syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple high-intensity lesions, including one in the left dorsal pons. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated PR3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody level of 205 IU/mL. A kidney biopsy on day 18 revealed crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis, confirming the diagnosis of GPA. Corticosteroid pulse therapy was initiated, but gastrointestinal perforation occurred on day 26, requiring extensive gastrectomy. Pathology revealed ulcerative changes and neutrophil infiltration, but no vasculitic lesions. Because of hepatic dysfunction from hepatitis C virus infection, escalation of immunosuppressive therapy was not feasible. On day 111, the patient developed a second gastrointestinal perforation, leading to sepsis and death on day 136. Autopsy revealed duodenal perforation and multiple cerebral infarctions corresponding to prior magnetic resonance imaging findings. No definitive vasculitic lesions were identified. This case highlights an unusual central nervous system onset of GPA as MLF syndrome. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis should be considered even in patients with atypical neurological manifestations, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential."
41676054,Use of LVAD HeartMate 3 and Impella RP in the management of advanced heart failure in an elderly patient: a case report.,2026,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."
41675927,Analysis of prognostic risk factors and risk management measures for patients with ischemic stroke and bloodstream infection based on machine learning.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Through the machine learning Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, the system screened core prognostic risk factors for patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infection, constructed and validated a predictive model, provides a basis for formulating precise risk management strategies in clinical practice. METHODS: Clinical data from patients with bloodstream infections secondary to ischaemic stroke were retrospectively included. The dataset was randomly allocated into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Within the training set, Model 1 was constructed using traditional univariate and multivariate Cox regression methods, while Model 2 employed the machine learning LASSO regression algorithm. Models were compared using metrics including R-squared, C-index. The superior model was selected for validation on both training and validation sets using Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curves, and Decision-Making Curves (DCA). RESULTS: Model 2 was adopted as the final model, with a nomogram generated for the training set. As demonstrated by the nomogram, an increase in the total score was observed in patients with concomitant pneumonia, heart failure (HF), or coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD), in cases where mechanical ventilation (MV) was utilised, and in instances of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and C-reactive protein-lymphocyte ratio (CLR) values, and reduced albumin levels. In the training set, the AUC values for predicting 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day survival rates were 0.875, 0.886, and 0.861, respectively. The AUC value for the 28-day prognosis on the internal test set was 0.844, while that on the external validation dataset was 0.860. The model demonstrated high concordance between predicted and actual probabilities across three distinct cohorts. The clinical decision curve indicates that the model provides good net benefit within the 5%-25% range at all three time points (7,14,and 28 days) across the three datasets. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities such as pneumonia and hypoalbuminaemia constitute prognostic risk factors affecting patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infections. LASSO regression enables precise identification of these risk factors, yielding a prognostic prediction model with outstanding predictive efficacy and clinical utility. Clinicians may utilise model variables to implement targeted risk management strategies."
41670969,Prognostic Impact and Risk Factors of Septic Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Septic Shock: An Observational Study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify risk factors associated with septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) in patients diagnosed with septic shock and to assess differences in clinical outcomes between those with septic shock alone and those with concomitant SCM. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 108 patients diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, between December 2022 and July 2024. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of SCM: the non-SCM group (n = 90) and the SCM group (n = 18). Baseline characteristics, laboratory markers, cardiac function indices, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify risk factors for SCM. Within the SCM group, outcomes were further analyzed according to survival status to assess the association between cardiac function recovery and mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of SCM among patients with septic shock was 16.67%. Compared with the non-SCM group, the SCM group showed a significantly higher prevalence of urinary tract infections and a history of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05). Higher scores were observed for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scales, along with increased levels of admission-day troponin I, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, maximum lactic acid (LACmax), maximum brain natriuretic peptide, and peak troponin I (p < 0.05). In contrast, mean arterial pressure at admission, minimum left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and end-point LVEF (LVEFend%) were significantly lower in this group (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified elevated IL-1 levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14), higher APACHE II scores (OR = 1.13), and increased LACmax (OR = 1.47) as risk factors for SCM (p < 0.05). The presence of SCM was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality and increased healthcare costs (p < 0.05). Among patients with SCM, recovery of LVEF and cardiac output was correlated with improved survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: Elevated IL-1 levels, increased peak lactic acid concentration, and higher APACHE II scores were associated with the development of SCM in patients with septic shock. SCM was further associated with increased mortality and greater healthcare resource utilization. Restoration of cardiac function, particularly improvements in LVEF and cardiac output, was correlated with improved prognosis and may serve as a valuable indicator of clinical outcomes."
41669529,Intestinal microenvironment dynamics and Sepsis-associated encephalopathy pathophysiology: insights from multi-omics profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a devastating complication of sepsis, lacks specific biomarkers and clear pathophysiological understanding, particularly regarding the gut-brain axis. While gut dysbiosis is implicated in SAE, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (16S rDNA and fecal miRNA sequencing) to dissect the gut microenvironment in SAE patients (n = 10) compared to sepsis patients without encephalopathy (SP, n = 20). RESULTS: Although alpha- and beta-diversity indices showed no significant differences, distinct compositional shifts in the gut microbiota were observed in SAE patients, characterized by increased abundance of Neisseria, Haemophilus, Lautropia, Enterococcus, Parabacteroides, and decreased Fusobacterium, Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, among others. Concurrently, 12 fecal miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in SAE, with 11 upregulated (e.g., miR-106a-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-30e-3p) and 1 downregulated (miR-222-3p). Crucially, correlation network analysis revealed significant interactions between 10 DE miRNAs and 15 bacterial genera, establishing a complex gut microbiota-miRNA interplay in SAE. Machine learning (LASSO and elastic net regression) identified miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as the most promising combined diagnostic biomarkers, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893. Functional exploration via ceRNA network analysis indicated miR-30e-3p targets inflammation and apoptosis-related genes (e.g., IL1B, RPS6KB1, AKT1), while miR-223-5p primarily targets immune-regulatory genes (e.g., IGF1, AR). Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated serum IL-1beta levels in SAE patients (p < 0.001), supporting the predicted inflammatory pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of a fecal miRNA-gut microbiota interaction network in SAE pathogenesis, highlighting miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as pivotal mediators and potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets."
41669126,"Evaluation of procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in children in Owerri, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Timely diagnosis remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional blood culture. This study evaluates procalcitonin as a biomarker for bacterial sepsis in children aged 0-59 months in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2023 and February 2024. It involved 298 children aged 0-59 months with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) who were admitted to the Emergency Pediatric Unit and Special Care Baby Unit of Federal Teaching Hospital, Owerri. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured using ELISA, and blood cultures were processed using the BacT/Alert system. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of procalcitonin were compared against blood culture results. RESULTS: Of the 298 children, 142 (47.7%) had culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of serum procalcitonin were 66.9%, 89.7%, 85.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for serum procalcitonin was 0.80 across all age groups which were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin has a good diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial sepsis in children and can complement blood culture in resource-limited settings. Further studies are recommended to explore its application in routine clinical practice."
41668768,Role of DNA methylation in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression in neonates with late-onset sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major health issue, particularly in resource-poor areas. This study aimed to assess the role of DNA methylation in regulating the inflammatory cytokine expression in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing neonates with LOS (n=42) before and after 72 hours of antibiotic treatment (n=25) to healthy controls (HC) (n=42). We analysed DNA methylation patterns and inflammatory cytokine expression levels in both groups. RESULTS: DNA methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation in pro-inflammatory genes and hypermethylation in anti-inflammatory genes in LOS neonates. These patterns were shifted in follow-up group, with significant changes in inflammatory marker levels, including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta. The gene expression results aligned with the DNA methylation findings, indicating that changes in the expression of inflammatory genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) are influenced by DNA methylation. The results were further validated through an analysis of plasma cytokine levels. LOS cases showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, except IL-10. In the follow-up group, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Understanding these molecular changes could lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing neonatal sepsis."
41668763,Mechanistic and therapeutic dimensions of DcR3-mediated immunomodulation in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host-immune responses, progressing through hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive stages. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a soluble member of the TNF receptor superfamily, serves as an immunomodulator in sepsis. Beyond neutralizing FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A to block apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, DcR3 regulates macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and immune cell survival through its heparan sulfate proteoglycan-binding domain. Evidence from cellular, molecular, and animal studies highlights its dual role in restoring immune balance by modulating both hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases of sepsis. In this review, we summarize current evidence on DcR3 in sepsis and discuss translational challenges and future directions. Current rodent models lacking the TNFRSF6B gene are limited; however, transgenic mice expressing human DcR3 exhibit both protective and detrimental context-dependent effects. Translational challenges include the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of recombinant DcR3, although strategies such as PEGylation, nanoparticle encapsulation, and hydrogel delivery may improve its efficacy. Combining DcR3 with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or immunometabolic agents like metformin and dimethyl itaconate presents promising therapeutic potential. Future research will focus on CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in mouse models, multi-omics mapping of DcR3 signaling, and biomarker-guided dosing. Although no DcR3-targeted clinical trials in sepsis have been conducted, DcR3 remains a precision-targeted immunotherapy with mechanistic and translational pathways; this review delineates key knowledge gaps that must be addressed to enable future clinical application."
41668730,Exploring the association between dexmedetomidine and all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis through propensity score matching analysis and machine learning algorithms: a MIMIC-IV retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis carries high ICU mortality globally, often requiring sedated mechanical ventilation. While some studies suggest dexmedetomidine improves survival in these patients, others contradict this finding. This study evaluates dexmedetomidine's survival benefit and sedation value for ventilated sepsis cases. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database and eICU-CRD to analyze mechanically ventilated septic patients. Propensity score matching was employed to balance covariates. Machine learning algorithms were applied to validate dexmedetomidine's role in predicting mortality. RESULTS: A propensity score matching analysis was performed for 5176 pairs of patients. The use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (13.39% vs. 19.84%, HR: 0.595, P < 0.001) and of 180-day all-cause mortality (17.45% vs. 23.18%, HR: 0.632, P < 0.001). However, dexmedetomidine use was also associated with longer hospital (median 15.08 days vs. 10.2 days, P < 0.001) and ICU stays (median 6.81 days vs. 4.0 days, P < 0.001). Moreover, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in the dexmedetomidine group (median 78 h vs. 51.00 h, P < 0.001). Dexmedetomidine was included among the significant features identified with the Boruta algorithm, and of the five machine learning models built using the 20 most important features (including dexmedetomidine), the model constructed on the basis of the Random Forest algorithm performed the best (training set: AUC = 0.781; test set: AUC = 0.811; eICU-CRD set: AUC = 0.820). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that comorbid acute kidney injury (AKI) was the most important predictor of mortality among mechanically ventilated septic patients. This was followed by the use of opioids, PaO(2), and the SOFA score, with the use of dexmedetomidine relatively closely behind. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine use significantly reduces short-term mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis but prolongs the hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and duration of mechanical ventilation. Administering dexmedetomidine within 48 hours and maintaining an infusion rate at or below 0.6 mug/kg/h appears to be more beneficial. Moreover, dexmedetomidine use strongly influences mortality in these patients."
41668728,Omega-3 fatty acids as host-directed immunomodulatory therapeutics in sepsis: real-world evidence supporting drug development potential for systemic inflammatory diseases.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality worldwide, characterized by dysregulated inflammation and immune dysfunction mechanisms also central to many neglected tropical diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-3 FAs) possess potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that may improve survival outcomes in such conditions. This retrospective real-world study evaluated the impact of Omega-3 FA supplementation on ICU mortality among patients with sepsis and identified prognostic factors influencing therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Patients admitted with sepsis to the ICU of Shenzhen People's Hospital between December 2016 and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied at a 1:2 ratio between Omega-3 FA-treated and control groups using covariates including age, sex, diagnosis, norepinephrine (NE) requirement, hemofiltration (HF), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte count. Logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to determine the independent effect of Omega-3 FAs on mortality. RESULTS: A total of 633 patients were included (Omega-3 FA group, n = 211; control, n = 422). The unadjusted mortality rate was 32.7% in the Omega-3 FA group and 24.6% in controls (p = 0.032). Univariate analysis showed a weak protective effect of Omega-3 FAs (HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-1.02, p = 0.062). After adjusting for age, HF and NE requirements, CRP, lymphocyte count, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and abdominal infection, Omega-3 FAs demonstrated a significant protective effect (HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83, p = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed improved survival in the Omega-3 FA group (p = 0.038). Advanced age, elevated CRP, and higher NE dependence were identified as factors that negatively modulated Omega-3 FA efficacy. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with significantly reduced adjusted ICU mortality in sepsis, underscoring its host-directed immunomodulatory properties. These findings highlight the translational potential of Omega-3 FAs as adjunct therapeutic agents in sepsis and other infection-associated inflammatory disorders, supporting further drug development toward host-directed treatments for neglected tropical diseases."
41662743,"Burden of Antibiotic Resistance in Hospitalized Children in Kenya: Associations with Mortality, Hospital Stay, and Treatment Costs.",2026,"Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing threat to pediatric care, yet data on its clinical and economic burden in low-resource settings remain limited. The impact of antibiotic-resistant infections on mortality, hospital stay, and treatment costs was assessed among children admitted to a national referral hospital in Kenya in the present study. A retrospective review of medical records for pediatric patients (0-12 years) hospitalized with bacterial infections between January 2017 and December 2021 was conducted. Diagnoses included gastroenteritis, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and others. Data on treatment, laboratory testing, outcomes, hospital stays, and costs were abstracted. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression, and mixed-effects negative binomial and generalized linear models. Among 1,608 patients, 63% were infants, and 38% were referrals. Gastroenteritis (46%) and pneumonia (28%) were the most common diagnoses. Antibiotic-resistant infections occurred in 27% of participants and were associated with higher mortality (26% versus 9% in susceptible participants) and an attributable risk of 17%; the population attributable fraction was 65%. After adjustment, resistance was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.44), longer hospital stays (60% increase), and higher treatment costs (33% increase). Antimicrobial resistance significantly increases mortality, hospital stays, and healthcare costs in pediatric patients. Strengthening diagnostics, antimicrobial stewardship, and policy interventions is critical to address this threat."
41662731,"Neonatal Sepsis: Etiology, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, and Treatment Outcomes in a Tertiary Hospital in Jos, Nigeria.",2026,"Sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Current knowledge of etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and outcomes provides evidence for judicious antimicrobial use. The aim for the present study was to identify etiologic organisms, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment outcomes at a tertiary hospital in Jos, Nigeria. A retrospective case review of neonates hospitalized for sepsis was conducted between August 25, 2017 and December 31, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 1,984 neonates admitted, of whom 516 (26%) were diagnosed with neonatal sepsis (NNS). The clinical and blood culture data were available for 380 (74%) neonates, of whom 226 (60%) were male. The majority (63%) were diagnosed with early-onset sepsis, of whom 146 (38%) had severe sepsis. The mean age of the mothers was 29.5 +/- 5.5 years. Of the 207 cultures obtained, 87 (43%) yielded pure isolates, with 50 (58%) of these being Gram-positive. For neonates born outside the study hospital, 6/36 (17%) were methicillin-sensitive, compared with 6/44 (14%) neonates born at the study hospital. Gram-negative isolates, predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae, grew in 36 (41%) of all positive cultures (27/87; 31%). More organisms were sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam (19/19; 100%), gentamicin (21/27; 78%), imipenem (4/8; 50%), and ceftazidime (17/28; 61%) than to the other antibiotics tested. Mortality in all patients with proven or presumed NNS was 31/380 (8%), with increased mortality in those without cultures (8/71; 11% versus 39/71; 55%). Neonatal sepsis-related mortality is high in the study center in Jos, Nigeria. Additional work is needed to mitigate NNS mortality and the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance."
41660626,GDF15 orchestrates mitochondrial-immune crosstalk via SMAD7-HIF-1alpha-PKM2 cascade to attenuate septic liver injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure involves pathological crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperinflammation, yet endogenous protective mechanisms remain incompletely defined. This study investigates Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) as a potential regulator of sepsis tolerance. METHODS: Using LPS-challenged mouse endotoxemia and a murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell line model, we assessed GDF15's functional role through: (1) recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 8 (rAAV8)-mediated tissue-specific overexpression, (2) siRNA knockdown, (3) pharmacological modulation (BAY 87-2243/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) inhibitor, Shikonin/PKM2 inhibitor, Asiaticoside/SMAD7 activator), and (4) comprehensive metabolic-inflammatory phenotyping including mitochondrial complex integrity (assessed via UQCRC1, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Core Protein 1), cytokine dynamics (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and lactate metabolism. RESULTS: LPS challenge induced time-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction concurrent with cytokine storms and compensatory GDF15 upregulation in both liver and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific GDF15 overexpression attenuated injury through restored mitochondrial integrity, diminished macrophage infiltration, and reduced systemic inflammation, as evidenced by significantly lower levels of circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6. Mechanistically, GDF15 preserved mitochondrial homeostasis by inducing SMAD7 expression while suppressing HIF-1alpha accumulation and PKM2 nuclear translocation. Pharmacological HIF-1alpha/PKM2 inhibition recapitulated GDF15's protective effects, restoring mitochondrial function and reducing inflammation even in GDF15-deficient models. Clinical analysis of a sepsis patient cohort (n=119) confirmed a significant elevation of circulating GDF15, with its levels strongly correlating with disease severity scores. Critically, SMAD7 activation attenuated HIF-1alpha accumulation and rescued mitochondrial failure independently of GDF15 status. CONCLUSION: GDF15 orchestrates sepsis tolerance through the SMAD7-HIF-1alpha axis, preserving mitochondrial integrity while resolving metabolic-inflammatory dysregulation, notably by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. This study identifies GDF15 as a central guardian of mitochondrial-immune homeostasis in sepsis, positioning it as both a robust severity biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for mitochondrial resuscitation."
41658299,Investigation of invasive Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y ST1466 case increases in New York State.,2025,"Bacterial meningitis and septicemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention and prompt treatment. In the United States, cases of N. meningitidis serogroup Y increased sharply in 2023, leading to a CDC health advisory issued in March 2024, alerting public health agencies and healthcare providers of this surge. N. meningitidis serogroup Y is of particular concern because these strains demonstrate higher levels of resistance to the antimicrobials ciprofloxacin and penicillin. At the Wadsworth Center Bacteriology Laboratory (WCBL), all N. meningitidis isolates received are identified, serogroup determined by real-time PCR, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed. A subset of isolates undergo whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the multilocus sequence type (MLST), presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, and relatedness analysis for outbreak investigations. In this study, we sequenced all 36 N. meningitidis serogroup Y isolates received between 2018 and 2024, of which 20 (~55%) were determined to be sequence type (ST) 1466. We used multiple bioinformatic methods to characterize the relatedness of isolates received at WCBL and compared them with ST1466 isolates from the United States with publicly accessible genomes. We identified a cluster of 8 cases of ST1466 N. meningitidis from the same region of New York State (NYS) that included a known transmission event linked to sharing a cigarette. Cases in this cluster were comprised of predominantly unvaccinated, African American, non-Hispanic, males between 45 and 76 years old, and mostly presented with sepsis; a demographic and clinical presentation not typical of those affected by N. meningitidis in the United States. Comparisons with publicly available genomes from ST1466 N. meningitidis strains from across the country showed that relatedness methods that mask genomic regions showing recombination signatures can obscure the diversity among these strains. This study, which importantly includes a case of known recent transmission, highlights the need to revisit genomic relatedness estimation and thresholds for defining relatedness in N. meningitidis. Our results also illuminate the importance of surveillance and characterization of N. meningitidis for future prevention and treatment, and the increased resolution that WGS provides to surveillance efforts."
41657574,Case Report: Extensive colonic necrosis and perforation in an HIV patient with syphilis complicated by sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: 'Soluble' total colon necrosis is a rare condition with an unclear etiology and few reports on treatment modalities. This case report describes severe intestinal necrosis in an HIV-infected patient, detailing clinical manifestations, diagnostic process, treatment regimen, and outcomes, thereby providing a reference for similar cases in the future. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 41-year-old man diagnosed with HIV 6 years ago, receiving long-term therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz. He has no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, inflammatory bowel disease, or intestinal tuberculosis, but has had multiple sexual partners. He was admitted with 3 h of abdominal pain; a blood pressure of 108/76 mmHg; a heart rate of 148 bpm, and physical findings of generalized abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, muscle rigidity, and diminished bowel sounds. Laboratory results showed elevated procalcitonin (5.15 ng/mL), white blood cells (9.2 x 10;9/L), and C-reactive protein (232.10 mg/L). Abdominal CT revealed thickened walls in the ileocecal region, colon, and rectum, with small bowel dilation, gas, and fluid accumulation, indicating hollow organ perforation and diffuse peritonitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed extensive necrosis of the colon and rectum, with perforation at the hepatic flexure of the colon. A total colectomy, rectal resection, and ileostomy were performed. Postoperative pathology revealed acute and chronic suppurative inflammation with necrosis and perforation. Postoperative sepsis developed, and further examination revealed the presence of syphilis antibodies and liver function impairment. Following treatment with anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, liver-protective, and nutritional support therapies, the patient's condition improved. On the 9th postoperative day, the patient was transferred to a community hospital for further treatment and was discharged on the 23rd postoperative day. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the rare occurrence of extensive necrosis and perforation of the colon in an HIV-infected patient with co-occurring syphilis. Although the precise role of syphilis in the development of gastrointestinal complications remains uncertain, this case highlights the need for heightened clinical awareness of co-infections in immunocompromised patients."
41651602,Microcirculatory Dysfunction in Sepsis.,2026,"Microcirculatory dysfunction plays a central role in sepsis pathophysiology and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. While advances in bedside tools and biomarkers offer potential for identifying microcirculatory dysfunction, most therapies targeting the microcirculation have not translated into improved clinical outcomes. Future advances likely lie in precision medicine approaches that employ microcirculatory measurements to guide individualized resuscitation strategies. This article highlights current evidence on the physiology, assessment, and therapeutic approaches to microvascular dysfunction in sepsis, underscoring the need for precision medicine strategies and further research into patient subgroups that may benefit from microcirculation directed interventions."
41651601,Immunology of Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis-related immune dysregulation occurs in three overlapping phases, including pathogen recognition, inflammation, and immune paralysis. There are many immune cells that underlie these three phases, with the most well-studied being epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. These cells regulate multiple downstream mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, that can be measured and used as immunologic biomarkers. Past failures in sepsis immune-modulating treatment trials have likely resulted from the inclusion of patients meeting sepsis clinical criteria but who do not sufficiently express the immunologic target under investigation. More precise approaches to trial designs may uncover effective immune-modulating therapies."
41651600,"Pediatric Sepsis: Evolving Subphenotypes, Overlap Syndromes, and the Path to Precision Therapies.",2026,"Pediatric sepsis is a complex syndrome shaped by developmental considerations, age-specific physiology, immunologic heterogeneity, and hyperinflammatory overlap syndromes. Recent evidence underscores a dynamic interplay between hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis in pediatric patients with sepsis, emphasizing the need for rapid, personalized diagnostic tools. While revised pediatric scoring systems and targeted immunotherapies have been developed, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal timing and patient selection for immunomodulatory interventions. This article consolidates current understanding of pediatric sepsis pathobiology, explores emerging pediatric subphenotypes, and examines early stage clinical trials investigating precision medicine approaches in pediatric sepsis."
41651591,"Defining Sepsis: Past, Present, and Future.",2026,"A common definition of sepsis is necessary to identify patients with sepsis in clinical practice, to enroll patients into prospective research studies, and to conduct surveillance and retrospective research. However, defining sepsis has proven challenging. Sepsis has generally been conceptualized as an injurious host response to infection. Modern definitions have evolved from defining this injurious host response as a systemic inflammatory response to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. While current sepsis definitions have several limitations, including the lack of a gold standard and tremendous heterogeneity of presentations, ongoing research offers promise to improve sepsis diagnosis and future definitions."
41648052,Pediatric severe sepsis: epidemiology and risk factors associated with acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric severe sepsis (PSS) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children, incurring substantial social costs. Acute kidney injury (AKI) plays a critical role in determining PSS severity and prognosis. However, existing literature provides limited data regarding the risk factors associated with AKI in pediatric sepsis patients and the impact of AKI on hospital outcomes for these patients. This study aimed to analyze the temporal trends in incidence and outcomes of AKI among hospitalized PSS patients from 2010 to 2019, and identify associated risk factors; and assess the impact of AKI on in-hospital mortality and healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: This study utilized the nationally representative National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database of the United States to conduct a retrospective analysis. All children aged 0 (infants) to 18 years who were diagnosed with severe sepsis between 2010 and 2019 were included. Patients were grouped by AKI status, and in-hospital mortality and medical resource utilization (length of stay and inflation-adjusted costs) were compared. Multivariate regression identified AKI risk factors. RESULTS: The incidence rate of AKI among hospitalized PSS patients increased from 2.7% in 2010 to 8.0% in 2019. However, in-hospital mortality declined from 32.40% to 17.90% over the same period. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in patients with comorbidities. Studies have shown that hospitalizations associated with AKI have a higher likelihood of involving infection sites and a variety of pathogenic flora. CONCLUSION: While the incidence of AKI increased from 2010 to 2019, associated mortality decreased. This likely reflects advancements in critical care that are improving survival, even as more cases are recognized. AKI, affecting 5% of PSS patients, remained a potent marker of severity, was associated with a sevenfold increased risk of mortality and driven by identifiable risk factors like specific comorbidities and infections. Enhanced early identification of at-risk children is crucial to further improve outcomes."
41647308,Infective endocarditis in children with chronic intestinal failure.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but serious complication in pediatric patients with chronic intestinal failure (IF) dependent on long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) via central venous access devices (CVADs). This study aimed to investigate the incidence, clinical features and outcomes of IE in children with chronic IF at a single institution. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in pediatric patients (0-18 years) with chronic IF requiring PN for > 60 days during 2013-2024. IE was diagnosed using modified Duke criteria. RESULTS: Five IE episodes occurred in 4 patients out of 29 with chronic IF (median follow-up 9 years). The overall incidence was 0.144 per 1000 catheter days (5155.2 per 100,000 person-years). Compared with patients without IE, those with IE had longer catheter durations (median 2941.5 vs. 443.0 days, p = 0.006); more central line-associated bloodstream infections (median 8 vs. 1, p = 0.0015); higher prevalence of catheter-related venous thrombosis (100 % vs. 12 %, p = 0.001); and were more likely to have dysmotility (75 % vs. 16 %, p = 0.02). IE resolved with antimicrobial therapy in all cases. During a median follow-up of 2.2 years, one patient died from superior vena cava obstruction, sepsis and multiorgan failure while awaiting transplantation; one achieved enteral autonomy and was weaned off PN; and two underwent successful intestinal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Though uncommon, IE poses significant risks in pediatric IF; early cardiac surveillance in high-risk patients may facilitate timely diagnosis and intervention."
41647022,Establishment and validation of a 28-day mortality prediction model based on the lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratio in patients with severe pneumonia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia (SP) is a common and often fatal disease. Traditional mortality risk assessments rely on complex scoring systems and lack simple, effective biomarkers. This study aims to explore the potential value of the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with severe pneumonia admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, from January 2020 to May 2025. Clinical data, laboratory indicators, and LAR values were collected. Cox regression analysis, the Boruta feature selection algorithm, and various machine learning models were employed for analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day survival status, and the relationship between LAR and mortality risk was evaluated, leading to the development of a prediction model based on LAR. RESULTS: Among the 491 patients, LAR was significantly associated with 28-day mortality risk and was identified as an independent risk factor for death in severe pneumonia. LAR demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC) in predicting mortality, exhibiting a significant nonlinear relationship with 28-day mortality risk. Among several machine learning models constructed using key variables selected by the Boruta algorithm, the random forest (RF) model exhibited the best predictive performance. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value analysis confirmed the dominant role of LAR in the RF model. CONCLUSION: LAR is an effective biomarker with significant clinical value in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. The LAR-based prediction model enhances the accuracy of mortality risk assessment, especially in non-septic patients. Combined with machine learning techniques, LAR offers a novel tool for early clinical risk evaluation and holds promising potential for clinical application."
41647020,Development and validation of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common and debilitating complication after sepsis. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict post-sepsis cognitive impairment and identify key clinical risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 866 adult sepsis patients treated in our hospital between January 2020 and January 2025 was analyzed. Cognitive function was assessed 1-3 months after discharge using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with scores < 26 indicating impairment. Key predictors were selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Five ML models-logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT)-were developed and evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied for interpretability. RESULTS: Cognitive impairment occurred in 195 patients (22.5%). Seven variables were identified as key predictors of cognitive impairment, including age, years of education, septic shock, benzodiazepine use, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) level. The RF model performed best, with AUCs of 0.947 (training set) and 0.895 (validation set), showing good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis showed that SOFA score had the greatest influence on cognitive impairment, followed by age, APACHE II score, IL-10, and years of education. CONCLUSION: Using SHAP analysis, the RF model provided clear insights into the key factors contributing to the model's prediction of cognitive impairment after sepsis. The model not only achieved high predictive accuracy but also offered a transparent, data-driven tool to identify patients at elevated risk, potentially enabling timely interventions and tailored clinical management."
41643412,Low risk of endometrioma infection after oocyte retrieval.,2025,"RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage following oocyte retrieval in women with ovarian endometrioma? DESIGN: This retrospective observational cohort study included women aged 18-43 years with a confirmed radiological diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma who underwent ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or fertility preservation between January 2018 and December 2023 at a single tertiary academic centre. All procedures were performed under standardized aseptic conditions with antibiotic prophylaxis. Transcystic puncture was performed when deemed necessary. The primary outcome was the incidence of endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage within 30 days after oocyte retrieval. RESULTS: Oocyte retrievals were performed in 1102 out of 1668 cycles (66.1%) for IVF/ICSI and in 566 cycles (33.9%) for fertility preservation. Bilateral endometriomas were present in 322 of 880 patients (36.6%), with a mean cyst (SD) diameter of 31.5 +/- 22.7 mm. Endometriomas larger than 30 mm accounted for 295 of 649 cases (45.5%). Intentional transcystic puncture was performed in 76 of 1148 applicable procedures (6.6%), and endometrioma drainage during oocyte retrieval occurred in 52 cases (4.5%). Endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage occurred in 6 of 1668 procedures (0.36%). Only one infection was reported following transcystic puncture (1.3%). No cases of sepsis or septic shock occurred. Five infections were managed with ultrasound-guided transvaginal drainage; one required laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endometrioma infection requiring surgical intervention after oocyte retrieval, including after transcystic puncture, is low. These findings support the safety of assisted reproductive techniques in women with endometriomas."
41640744,Development and validation of a nutrition-integrated nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, necessitating early risk stratification. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for 28-day mortality in sepsis patients incorporating machine learning-selected biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 1,350 sepsis patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training (n = 944) and testing (n = 406) sets. LASSO and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to screen key biomarkers associated with mortality. A logistic regression model was constructed using the selected features, and a nomogram was developed by integrating these biomarkers with APACHE II, SOFA score, and shock status. Model performance was evaluated by AUC, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). External validation was performed in an independent cohort of 120 patients. RESULTS: Six biomarkers consistently selected by both LASSO and RF were: procalcitonin (PCT), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher levels of PCT, ALT, and IBIL, and lower levels of RBC, PLT, and PNI compared to survivors (all P < 0.05). The logistic regression model demonstrated strong discrimination [AUC: 0.841 (95% CI: 0.814-0.868) in training set; 0.808 (95% CI: 0.769-0.847) in testing set]. The nomogram showed good calibration and favorable net clinical benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities. In the external validation cohort, the model maintained excellent predictive performance with an AUC of 0.921 (95% CI: 0.876-0.966). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a clinically useful nomogram incorporating nutrition-related biomarkers, particularly PNI, for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. The model demonstrates robust performance and highlights the importance of nutritional status in sepsis outcomes."
41640555,"Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility from blood culture specimens in Wad Medani, Sudan: a four-year laboratory-based, cross-sectional study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-resistant bacterial bloodstream infections are rapidly emerging, which makes successful treatment challenging. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility from blood culture samples. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. All clinical samples were collected from patients at Wad Medani and investigated at the Pathology Center for Diagnosis and Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Gazira, Sudan, from the 1st of January, 2020, to the 15th of October, 2023. RESULTS: Overall, 577 blood samples were cultured. Among these samples, 86 (14.9%) exhibited bacterial growth. S. aureus (40.7%) and E. coli (40.7%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria. The most sensitive drugs to S. aureus were vancomycin 100% (13/13) and linezolid 86.7% (13/15), whereas the most sensitive drugs to E. coli were norfloxacin 88.9% (8/9), imipenem 85.7% (6/7), and levofloxacin 84% (21/25). The rate of bacterial growth has steadily increased over time, from 5% in 2020 to 24.9% in 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a modest rate of 14.9% of bloodstream infections, which has steadily increased over the years. The most frequently isolated bacteria were S. aureus and E. coli. Vancomycin was the most susceptible drug to isolated bacteria."
41636191,Predictive value of dynamic plasma biomarkers for clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome; data on early biomarker kinetics and their link to severity are scarce. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 80 children with sepsis (March 2022 - June 2024). C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and D-dimer were measured at admission (T0), 72 hours (T1) later and on Day 7 (T2). Disease severity was assessed using the pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA); length of stay (LOS) was recorded. Baseline values, Day 7 levels, and changes Delta(T2-T0) were correlated with pSOFA and LOS. RESULTS: Baseline inflammatory profiles differed by etiology: median CRP and PCT on admission were roughly doubled in bacterial versus viral disease, while IL‑6 was highest in respiratory and abdominal infections. Nevertheless, all six markers decreased significantly over seven days (p </= 0.015) and the proportional declines were uniform across pathogens or foci (interaction p > 0.18). Higher admission CRP, PCT, IL‑6 and D‑dimer modestly correlated with greater organ dysfunction (r </= 0.55), whereas steeper week‑long falls in the same markers tracked with larger pSOFA improvement (r = -0.41 to -0.53; all p </= 0.002). SAA showed a weaker inverse association (r = -0.32, p = 0.008), whereas the decline in ESR was not significant. A pragmatic two‑step algorithm (admission CRP  >/= 60 mg/L, PCT  >/= 3 ng/mL, IL‑6  >/= 200 pg/mL or D‑dimer  >/= 1.5 mg/L; plus a >/= 50% drop in IL‑6 or PCT within 72 h) identified children who ultimately required intensive care unit (ICU) care or stayed >/= 7 days with an area‑under‑the‑curve of 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Both initial elevations and early declines in CRP, PCT, IL-6 and D-dimer mirror organ dysfunction and hospitalization duration in pediatric sepsis. Serial monitoring of these readily available markers may improve early risk stratification and guide therapy."
41636183,Clinical significance of human herpesvirus 6 detected in cerebrospinal fluid: a 10-year retrospective study in children.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is occasionally detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of young children, but its clinical significance remains uncertain. This study aimed to describe HHV-6-positive cases and to explore features that may help distinguish presumed infection from bystander detection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with CSF HHV-6 detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction or the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (FA-ME) panel between January 2015 and March 2025 at a single tertiary hospital. Cases were categorized as presumed HHV-6 infection or bystander detection based on clinical features and the presence of alternative pathogens or diagnoses. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among 1,865 children tested, HHV-6 was detected in 25 (1.3%; median age, 6 months), all of whom presented with fever. Seizures occurred in seven (28%) and ataxia in one (4%). Two patients developed encephalitis; one had abnormal imaging and later developed epilepsy. Seventeen patients were classified as presumed infection. In this group, rash was more prevalent (59% vs. 13%, p = 0.04), neutrophil and platelet counts were lower at admission and declined further at follow-up (p < 0.05), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were higher (p < 0.01) than those in the bystander infection group. CSF pleocytosis did not differ significantly between groups. Two patients received ganciclovir; both had HHV-6 detected early by the FA-ME panel, and one was subsequently diagnosed with bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: HHV-6 encephalitis was uncommon. Rash, changes in neutrophil and platelet counts, along with elevated AST levels may help interpret CSF HHV-6 detection, but these findings require validation in larger studies incorporating virologic confirmation."
41631218,An Unusual Case of Lithium-Induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus.,2025,"We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with bipolar affective disorder on long-term lithium therapy who presented with confusion, acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency, with suspected urinary sepsis. Initial assessment revealed very high C-reactive protein (CRP), severe hyperglycemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI Stage 3). She was treated for urinary sepsis as computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis, and Escherichia coli was isolated from blood cultures. Lithium was withheld initially due to renal impairment. As she met diagnostic criteria for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), she was treated as per the hospital hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state protocol. Glycemic control improved with appropriate fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. When renal function improved, lithium was restarted due to behavioral deterioration, following which she developed polyuria, severe hypernatremia, and persistently elevated serum osmolality. Due to severe agitation, she required intensive care unit (ICU) support for clinical and biochemical monitoring. Despite the resolution of hyperglycemia, persistent polyuria and hypernatremia prompted suspicion of diabetes insipidus (DI). Elevated serum sodium, high serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality were consistent with the diagnosis of DI. Normal brain imaging, elevated baseline co-peptin, and no response to desmopressin excluded central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and supported nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) secondary to chronic lithium use. She was treated with thiazide diuretics, with significant improvement in her urine output and stabilization of serum sodium. Lithium was discontinued, and referral to psychiatry was arranged. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge in differentiating osmotic diuresis of HHS from lithium-induced NDI and emphasizes the need for clinical suspicion of NDI in patients on lithium therapy presenting with polyuria and electrolyte disturbances."
41626985,Optimal large language models to screen citations for systematic reviews.,2025,"Recent studies highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) in citation screening for systematic reviews; however, the efficiency of individual LLMs for this application remains unclear. This study aimed to compare accuracy, time-related efficiency, cost, and consistency across four LLMs-GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.3 70B-for literature screening tasks. The models screened for clinical questions from the Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2024. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each model based on conventional citation screening results for qualitative assessment. We also recorded the time and cost of screening and assessed consistency to verify reproducibility. A post hoc analysis explored whether integrating outputs from multiple models could enhance screening accuracy. GPT-4o and Llama 3.3 70B achieved high specificity but lower sensitivity, while Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited higher sensitivity at the cost of lower specificity. Citation screening times and costs varied, with GPT-4o being the fastest and Llama 3.3 70B the most cost-effective. Consistency was comparable among the models. An ensemble approach combining model outputs improved sensitivity but increased the number of false positives, requiring additional review effort. Each model demonstrated distinct strengths, effectively streamlining citation screening by saving time and reducing workload. However, reviewing false positives remains a challenge. Combining models may enhance sensitivity, indicating the potential of LLMs to optimize systematic review workflows."
41625897,Comparative Evaluation of Platelet Indices in Clinical and Culture-Positive Neonatal Sepsis: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is among the significant causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Blood culture, the diagnostic gold standard, is limited by delayed results and low sensitivity. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) may offer early, accessible biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of platelet indices, i.e., MPV and PDW, in clinical and culture-positive neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 170 neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the NICU at MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Participants were categorized into clinical (n = 88) and culture-positive (n = 82) sepsis groups. Platelet parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 170 neonates enrolled, 82 (48.2%) had culture-positive sepsis, while 88 (51.8%) were categorized as clinical sepsis. MPV and PDW were significantly higher in both the culture-positive group and the clinical sepsis group. CONCLUSION: MPV and PDW are significantly elevated in both the culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis and the clinical sepsis group. Platelet indices may serve as supportive diagnostic markers in resource-limited settings. Their integration with clinical and laboratory findings could enhance early diagnosis."
41625880,Predictive Value of Procalcitonin and C-reactive Protein for Mortality in Live Donor Liver Transplant Recipients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Accurate biomarkers are crucial for the early diagnosis of sepsis after liver transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting bacterial infections and mortality following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODOLOGY: We prospectively analyzed all adult LDLT patients at a tertiary center between January 2021 and December 2022. CRP and PCT levels were measured on postoperative days (POD) one, three, five, and seven, and compared among patients without infections, those with bloodstream infections, and those with other infections (urinary, bronchoalveolar lavage, or drain). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of PCT and CRP trends on short- and long-term mortality. RESULTS: Among 216 LDLT patients, 122 (56%) were analyzed after applying exclusion criteria. In patients without infections, median CRP and PCT levels were elevated on days one (CRP: 19, interquartile range (IQR): 11-29; PCT: 3, IQR: 1-13) and three (CRP: 18, IQR: 7-30; PCT: 2, IQR: 1-9) but decreased by days five (CRP: 10, IQR: 5-16; PCT: 1, IQR: 0.2-3) and seven (CRP: 10, IQR: 3-17; PCT: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-3). No absolute values of CRP or PCT effectively diagnosed infections. Patients with a decreasing trend in CRP from POD three to five to seven had survival rates of 90%, 86%, and 85% at 30, 90, and 600 days, respectively; in contrast, those with an increasing CRP trend had lower survival rates of 78%, 71%, and 40%, respectively. Similarly, a decline in PCT was associated with 30-, 90-, and 600-day survival rates of 90%, 85%, and 84%, while increasing PCT correlated with significantly lower rates of 75%, 70%, and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: While the absolute values of CRP and PCT were not diagnostic for infection, an increase in these biomarkers from days three to five to seven predicted significantly higher short- and long-term mortality in LDLT recipients."
41625807,From Liver to Lung: A Pathological Journey of Bilothorax.,2025,"Bilothorax is a rare and pathological condition characterized by the accumulation of bile in the pleural cavity. This phenomenon most commonly occurs on the right side due to anatomical proximity to the liver and biliary system. Bilateral or left-sided bilothorax remains exceedingly rare. Diagnosis relies on pleural fluid analysis, particularly a pleural-to-serum bilirubin ratio >1, and imaging. We report the case of a male patient in his mid-60s with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B7), hepatocellular carcinoma with pulmonary metastases, and multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus and portal hypertension. The patient was undergoing systemic therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, presented with chronic infected wounds and systemic symptoms and later developed gallbladder perforation with biliary peritonitis. Despite multidisciplinary management including percutaneous drainage, intravenous antibiotics, and intensive care support, his condition deteriorated. Subsequently, he developed a right-sided bilothorax, confirmed via thoracentesis, with a pleural-to-serum bilirubin ratio of 3.4 (normal < 0.6). Cultures isolated Enterobacter, and the patient was treated with targeted antibiotics and chest tube drainage. However, he experienced progressive hepatic decompensation, recurrent sepsis, and respiratory failure, ultimately leading to a transition to hospice care. This case is noteworthy due to the extreme rarity of bilothorax, the diagnostic complexity in distinguishing it from other pleural effusions, and the management challenges it poses in patients with advanced cirrhosis and malignancy."
41625328,"Baseline morbidity and chronic medications as determinants of sepsis outcomes: focus on statins, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs in a population-based cohort of 59,578 patients.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality, particularly among older adults with multiple chronic conditions. While comorbidities are known to influence outcomes, the role of chronic medication use before sepsis onset remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline health status and chronic treatments on sepsis-related mortality. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using linked administrative data from the Catalan Health System. Adults hospitalised with sepsis across 65 public hospitals in Catalonia during 2018-2019 were included. Baseline morbidity was assessed using the Adjusted Morbidity Groups (GMA) tool. Chronic medication use was defined as having received six or more prescription fills of a drug class in the 8 months prior to admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 59,578 sepsis patients (mean age 75.4 years), the in-hospital mortality rate was 18.5%. Most infections were community-acquired (88%) and associated with renal (58.3%) or cardiovascular (25.7%) dysfunction. The cohort had high comorbidity rates, with a GMA of 37.3, high level of dependency on health services; and high baseline health expenditure. Chronic use of statins, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), was observed in 28.5%, 5.6%, and 2.3% of patients respectively. Patients with high or very high GMA scores had the highest mortality rates. In multivariable analysis, chronic statin use was associated with lower odds of death (OR 0.782; 95% CI: 0.740-0.825), while corticosteroid (OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.085-1.306) and NSAID use (OR 1.415, 95% CI 1.226-1.632) were linked to increased mortality. Other risk factors included advanced age, active cancer, cirrhosis, and bloodstream infection. CONCLUSION: In this large population-based study, baseline comorbidities and chronic treatments significantly influenced sepsis outcomes. Statin use was associated with lower in-hospital mortality, whereas corticosteroids and NSAIDs were linked to worse prognosis. The GMA score proved useful in stratifying patient risk and may help to inform clinical decision-making and resource planning. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06354452."
41625152,Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV coinfection in severe adult meningoencephalitis: a rare diagnosis in a diabetic patient.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes is extremely rare in adults. We report a case of Streptococcus pyogenes combined with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was diagnosed by targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). The findings were subsequently confirmed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), respectively. Meanwhile, digital PCR (dPCR) detection indicated the presence of Streptococcus species DNA in the blood. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the possibility of meningitis. The patient's condition improved significantly following combined antibacterial and antiviral therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old female patient with a history of diabetes mellitus for over ten years presented with fever, vomiting, and impaired consciousness. CSF analysis showed significantly elevated cell count, elevated neutrophil percentage, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The tNGS result of CSF indicated Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV coinfection, meanwhile, dPCR of peripheral blood suggested the presence of Streptococcus species. The patient was therefore diagnosed with intracranial infection, sepsis, and septic shock. The antimicrobial therapy was promptly adjusted to include combined antibacterial and antiviral treatment. Following intervention, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. Subsequent CSF analysis and tNGS testing demonstrated normalization of cell count and LDH levels, a significant decrease in the detection level of Streptococcus pyogenes, and negative detection of EBV. CONCLUSION: Intracranial coinfection involving Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV is exceptionally rare in adults. Early clinical manifestations are often nonspecific, yet the disease can progress rapidly, underscoring the critical importance of prompt and accurate pathogen identification. The widespread application of tNGS has significantly enhanced early diagnostic capabilities in cases of intracranial infection."
41624884,Identification and validation of an endotoxin tolerance-based prognostic model with therapeutic insights in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis outcomes remain difficult to predict because immune trajectories are heterogeneous and dynamically shift from early activation to immunosuppression. Endotoxin tolerance (ET) in circulating monocytes/macrophages is a key mechanism of sepsis-associated immunosuppression but has not been systematically leveraged for prognostication. We sought to develop and clinically validate an ET-related gene (ETG) signature for short-term mortality risk stratification. METHOD: Public whole-blood transcriptomic datasets were intersected with curated ET gene sets to derive ETG candidates. An ensemble machine-learning framework (108 model/feature-selection combinations across 12 algorithms) was used to build and rank prognostic models for 28-day mortality; the final parsimonious signature (10 ETGs, including IL4R, ATM, CX3CR1, FCGR1A) informed a risk score. A two-variable nomogram (age + ETG risk score) was constructed. Internal performance was assessed by bootstrapped calibration, time-dependent ROC/AUC at 7, 14, and 28 days, and Harrell's C-index. Experimental validation used a prospective ICU cohort (n=50; 13 survivors, 37 non-survivors). PBMCs were profiled by RT-qPCR and Western blot; CD14(+) monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for FCGR1A/CD64, CX3CR1, and PD-1. We further explored regulatory context (ceRNA network) and druggability (DGIdb query and molecular docking to CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5). RESULTS: The 10-gene ETG signature stratified mortality risk with acceptable discrimination and calibration. AUCs were 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.83), 0.78 (0.72-0.83), and 0.73 (0.67-0.78) at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively; Harrell's C-index was 0.782. The age-integrated nomogram showed close agreement between predicted and observed survival across timepoints. Functional enrichment indicated immune-response pathways enriched in the low-risk group. In the clinical cohort, non-survivors exhibited lower mRNA and protein levels of FCGR1A, TLR5, and CX3CR1 in PBMCs; flow cytometry revealed reduced proportions of FCGR1A(+), CX3CR1(+), and PD-1(+) CD14(+) monocytes (p<0.01). The ceRNA analysis highlighted a putative NEAT1/miR-1287-5p/CX3CR1 axis. Docking suggested plausible ligandability of CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5, nominating candidates such as valproic acid and CGP-52608 for follow-up testing. CONCLUSION: An ET-anchored, 10-gene signature captures a clinically relevant axis of sepsis-associated immunosuppression and enables short-term mortality risk stratification. Integration with age yields a simple nomogram with stable internal performance. Multilayer validation (transcript, protein, single-cell) supports biological plausibility. Prospective multicenter studies with richer clinical annotation and functional assays are warranted to confirm generalizability and to evaluate ET-guided immunomodulatory strategies."
41624862,Immune signatures of sepsis from mild infection to critical illness - a prospective observational study.,2025,"Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is a phenomenon characterized by the development of several changes in immunophenotype which predispose to secondary infections and increased mortality risk. Immunomodulatory therapies have yet to reproducibly demonstrate benefit in large clinical trials. We propose that several changes consistent with an immunosuppressive phenotype in sepsis represent either adaptive changes or epiphenomenon, rather than direct drivers of outcome in infection and sepsis. We therefore conducted a prospective observational study of patients presenting with infections with a spectrum of illness severity, to evaluate canonical features of monocyte and lymphocyte immunosuppression using flow cytometry. Several features consistent with immunosuppression in sepsis are observed in mild infections and non-infectious acute conditions. These features may be better understood as markers along a continuum of illness severity rather than distinct features of critical illness. Monocyte HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), and an increase in soluble PD-L1, discriminate between critically ill patients, patients with mild infection, and patients with non-infectious illness. In contrast, CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte phenotype did not discriminate between patient groups. Immunotherapies targeting lymphocyte function may only be effective if simultaneously augmenting monocyte antigen presentation and co-stimulatory pathways. Combination immunotherapy in sepsis requires evaluation."
41624837,Multi-omics machine learning identifies diagnostic gene signatures and functionally supports PRKACB involvement in macrophage inflammatory responses in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response, often leading to organ failure and death. Diagnosis and therapy remain challenging. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for sepsis through multi-omics analysis and experimental validation. A total of 1,166 samples from the GEO repository underwent differential analysis, WGCNA, and logistic regression to identify sepsis-associated features. After SVM-RFE screening, a 28-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from healthy controls achieved an AUC of 0.970 (sensitivity 0.939, specificity 1.000) in an independent cohort and 0.870 (sensitivity 0.906, specificity 0.700) in qRT-PCR validation. A 13-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from SIRS achieved an AUC of 1.000 (sensitivity 1.000, specificity 1.000) and 0.745 (sensitivity 0.500, specificity 0.900), respectively. PRKACB, consistently decreased in sepsis, emerged as a myeloid-associated hub gene with functional support in macrophages. Single-cell analysis revealed that PRKACB is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, with macrophages and neutrophils showing the most notable compositional changes. Pathway enrichment indicated distinct PRKACB-related functions between sepsis and healthy controls, and across myeloid subtypes. Reducing PRKACB expression significantly upregulated TNF-alpha and IL-1beta release and decreased THP-1 macrophage viability, suggesting that excessive inflammation may trigger apoptosis or metabolic dysfunction. These data support PRKACB as a myeloid hub linked to macrophage inflammatory output and viability, while defining the precise downstream signaling as a priority for future studies."
41624828,High CRP and white blood cell counts are not reliable indicators of early-onset neonatal infection in full-term infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) is challenging, making it difficult to determine infection indicator characteristics and cutoff values in full-term infants. This study retrospectively analyzed full-term infants with high-risk factors for neonatal EOS but tested negative for EOS, aiming to identify infection indicator characteristics and their association with perinatal factors without antibiotic intervention. METHODS: Full-term infants at high risk for EOS who were admitted to rooming-in from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024 were included in the study. Blood routine examinations and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were dynamically monitored after birth. All demographic data and medical records were collected from the electronic medical records system. RESULTS: Among 103 neonates, only 2 had normal infection indicators. Within 24-48 h after birth, an additional 28 displayed normal infection indicators. Although most of the infants exhibited normal WBC within 24-48 h, 33 patients still had higher neutrophil percentages, and 62 had higher CRP levels. Moreover, several high-risk perinatal factors for abnormal infection indicators have been identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that infection indicators frequently showed abnormalities in full-term infants at high risk for EOS who tested negative. Few infants had normal infection indicators within 24 h, and although WBC levels normalized by 24-48 h, CRP levels remained elevated. Specific perinatal factors were also associated with abnormal infection markers. These findings reinforce the need for cautious interpretation of isolated biomarker elevations and support antimicrobial stewardship by highlighting the high frequency of abnormal indicators in uninfected infants, thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure."
41624824,Case Report: Clinical characteristics and multidisciplinary collaborative management of congenital tuberculosis in extremely preterm twins and preterm infants: a report of three cases and literature review.,2025,"AIMS: This study aims to report three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in premature infants, systematically analyze their clinical characteristics, diagnostic processes, and treatment outcomes, explore the core role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) in optimizing diagnosis and treatment, and provide an evidence-based basis for early identification, precise diagnosis, and effective therapy to reduce high mortality rates and enhance clinical management levels. METHODS: Through retrospective case reports combined with a literature review, three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in extremely premature twins and a premature infant were reported. Integration of maternal history, placental pathology assessment (such as acid-fast staining positive bacilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis qPCR detection), imaging examinations (such as chest x-ray and CT), etiological tests (such as NGS), and fundus examination results. Treatment adopted individualized anti-tuberculosis regimens (isoniazid 10-15 mg/kg/d, rifampicin 15-20 mg/kg/d, pyrazinamide 20-30 mg/kg/d), collaboratively developed by MDT (neonatology, infectious diseases, pharmacists, and ophthalmology experts), combined with supportive therapies (such as mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and nutritional support). Follow-up evaluated growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS: This study reported three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis, involving extremely premature twins at 27(+4) weeks (birth weights 890 g and 880 g) and one premature infant at 34(+1) weeks. The twins' mother had a history of tuberculosis of the uterus or uterine TB, fever during pregnancy, and postpartum confirmed tuberculosis (positive placental pathology and NGS); infants presented with respiratory distress and fever. Diagnostic basis included maternal history, placental pathology, NGS detection of Mycobacterium, and fundus examination (retinal white spot changes). Under MDT collaboration, anti-tuberculosis treatment (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide) and supportive therapy controlled the infection. The older twin (male) was hospitalized for 93 days, weight reached 3,670 g, and at follow-up to corrected age of 4.5 months, weight increased to 7.44 kg, length 59 cm; the younger twin (female) hospitalized for 60 days, weight 2,170 g, follow-up to corrected age of 4.5 months, weight 6.62 kg, length 54 cm. The twins had normal growth and development, no permanent visual impairment. The premature infant case was similar with good prognosis. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in extremely premature and premature infants is highly challenging due to the lack of specific symptoms, often misdiagnosed as sepsis or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This study observed through three cases that integrating chest imaging, etiological tests (such as NGS), placental pathology assessment, and fundus screening (such as retinal white spot changes) aids in early diagnosis. MDT collaboration in developing individualized anti-tuberculosis treatment plans (including isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide) supplemented with supportive therapy effectively improves infant prognosis, with normal weight gain post-discharge, good development, and no permanent visual damage. Strengthening prenatal screening and monitoring for high-risk pregnant women helps prevent such cases. In the future, multicenter studies should further optimize diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies to reduce mortality and improve neonatal quality of life."
41624787,Anaerobic pericarditis due to Clostridium ramosum: First known case report.,2026,"Anaerobic pathogens are uncommon etiologies of pericardial infections. Clostridium ramosum, an obligate anaerobic gram-positive bacillus and member of the normal gastrointestinal flora, is generally considered of low virulence but has been implicated in invasive infections in elderly or immunocompromised individuals. We report the first documented case of Clostridium ramosum pericarditis. An 85-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, splenomegaly with bicytopenia, and depression was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion on transthoracic echocardiography. Follow-up imaging revealed a reduced ejection fraction, progressive aortic dilation, and early tamponade physiology. Despite being asymptomatic, he underwent pericardiocentesis, which yielded 400 mL of fluid. Gram stain demonstrated gram-positive bacilli, later identified on anaerobic culture as Clostridium ramosum. Blood cultures remained negative. He was treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam followed by oral metronidazole, with resolution of the effusion and no recurrence on follow-up. This case highlights that anaerobic pericarditis can occur in the absence of systemic symptoms or sepsis, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities that predispose to bacterial translocation. Timely drainage and targeted antimicrobial therapy are essential for favorable outcomes. Importantly, routine anaerobic cultures of pericardial fluid should be considered to avoid missed diagnoses. Recognition of rare anaerobic pathogens in pericardial infections expands the understanding of their pathogenic potential and informs future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."
41624750,"The role of artificial intelligence in burn assessment, complication diagnosis, and outcome prediction: a narrative review.",2026,"Burn injury remains a major global health challenge, causing an estimated 180 000 deaths annually. The marked heterogeneity in burn severity, complications, and outcomes highlights the need for more objective and efficient evaluation strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to support clinical decision-making and improve patient care in this field. In this narrative review, we summarize the growing applications of AI in burn care, including the assessment of burn depth and total body surface area, monitoring of wound healing, prediction of postburn complications, and estimation of clinical outcomes. AI-based models have demonstrated strong performance in automating wound assessment, optimizing fluid resuscitation, and predicting complications such as sepsis, inhalation injury, and acute kidney injury. Furthermore, AI-driven prediction of mortality risk and hospital length of stay has shown potential to inform early interventions and improve resource allocation. Despite encouraging progress, most studies to date rely on small, single-center datasets and limited model validation, underscoring the need for larger, multi-institutional efforts, and standardized data sharing. Integrating AI into burn management holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic precision, forecasting outcomes, and personalizing treatment strategies. As these technologies advance, clinician familiarity and collaboration with AI tools will be critical to fully realize their potential in transforming burn care."
41624233,Platelet lipidome alterations in septic shock: a matched case-control study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Platelets play a central role in hemostatic and inflammatory responses during septic shock, with lipids being essential for their function. However, the specific lipidomic alterations occurring in platelets during septic shock remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize platelet lipidomic changes in septic shock and investigate their associations with disease severity. METHODS: In this matched case-control study, platelets were isolated from 49 septic shock patients and 47 nonseptic controls (matched for age, gender, and comorbidities). Lipidomic profiling was performed using untargeted lipidomics to identify significant alterations in the platelet lipidome. Associations among lipid changes, clinical data, and plasma biomarkers of coagulopathy and inflammation were explored. RESULTS: More than 60% of the annotated platelet lipids were significantly altered in septic shock. Cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and ether-lipids were significantly reduced, while ceramide levels increased. Fatty acyl chain remodeling displayed distinct patterns, with polyunsaturated fatty acids increasing in triacylglycerols and decreasing in phospholipids. Lipid alterations were strongly associated with thrombocytopenia, and lysophosphatidylcholine levels inversely correlated with disease severity, as indicated by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock induces significant disruptions in the platelet lipidome, with the extent of these alterations correlating with sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia severity. The observed changes affect multiple lipid classes, surpassing those reported under physiological conditions or in other diseases. These findings highlight the impact of sepsis-driven dysregulated inflammation and coagulopathy on platelet lipid composition, providing new insights into sepsis pathophysiology."
41623649,Whole-genome sequencing-based source tracing and infection control of Serratia marcescens blood culture events in pediatric patients.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) is an opportunistic pathogen increasingly associated with nosocomial infections in immunocompromised pediatric patients. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and molecular epidemiological characteristics of S. marcescens-positive blood cultures and to provide evidence for targeted infection prevention strategies. METHODS: Eleven cases of S. marcescens-positive blood cultures were identified across eight pediatric wards of a tertiary hospital in China in October 2024. Clinical and microbiological assessments were conducted to distinguish true infections from contamination. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize resistance, virulence, and plasmid replicons. Core genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenies, Bayesian temporal inference, and transmission tree reconstruction were used to explore genetic relatedness, transmission dynamics, and cryptic cases. RESULTS: Two cases were diagnosed as hospital-acquired sepsis, while nine were classified as contamination. The isolates exhibited intrinsic resistance to first- and second-generation cephalosporins but remained susceptible to carbapenems. Seven resistance genes-including aac(6')-Ic, oqxB, and tet(41)-and four virulence genes, including cheY and fliM, were identified. Nine isolates carried IncFII-type plasmids. Core genome SNP analysis revealed minimal genetic divergence, with the most recent common ancestor traceable to late 2023, suggesting approximately 10 months of silent transmission. Transmission tree inference further indicated the presence of undetected cryptic cases. Following the implementation of bundled interventions-including sink replacements and disinfectant use, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and environmental decontamination-no new cases occurred during 1 month of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study identified a highly clonal S. marcescens cluster with evidence of prolonged, unnoticed circulation and cross-ward transmission in the pediatric units. These findings underscore the hidden persistence of this pathogen in the hospital environment and the need for strengthened infection control measures."

41615731,Prognostic Value and Potential Mechanism of CD8+ T Subsets Phenotype in ICU Patients with Sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: While CD8+ T-cell subsets play a crucial role in sepsis prognosis, the prognostic value of their dynamic changes and molecular mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Compared to static single-timepoint measurements, the prognostic role of repeated measurements over time remains undetermined. METHODS: The study included 220 intensive care unit patients with sepsis (2023.08-2024.05). K-means clustering analysis based on CD8+CD28+/CD8+%, CD8+CD38+/CD8+%, and CD8+DR+/CD8+% was used to categorize patients into two groups. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for 28-day mortality prediction. Fifteen patients from each group were selected for Olink proteomics analysis to investigate differentially expressed proteins and conduct functional enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Using K-means clustering analysis based on CD8+ T-cell subset phenotypes, patients were divided into group 1 (n = 74) and group 2 (n = 146), with group 2 demonstrating significantly higher 28-day mortality compared to group 1 (32.3% vs. 17.6%, P < 0.001). Further dynamic trend analysis revealed that patients exhibiting continuously decreasing CD8+CD28+/CD8+% and increasing CD8+CD38+/CD8+% had the poorest prognosis, with a 28-day mortality rate of 50%. The combined measurement of CD8+CD28+/CD8+% and CD8+CD38+/CD8+% showed enhanced prognostic value (area under the curve = 0.676) compared to individual measurements, indicating the importance of monitoring multiple T-cell subset markers. Additionally, Olink proteomic analysis identified IL-12Rbeta1 as a key molecular mediator closely associated with CD8+ T-cell function and activation subsets, providing insights into the underlying mechanism of immune dysfunction in sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD8+ T-cell subset phenotypes serve as important prognostic indicators in sepsis, with IL-12Rbeta1 potentially being a key molecule affecting CD8+ T-cell function, providing a new potential target for sepsis monitoring and immunotherapy."
41614879,"Circulating miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p in Post-Mortem Whole Blood: An Exploratory Study of the Association with Sepsis-Related Death.",2025,"Accurate post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis remains a critical challenge in forensic pathology, as conventional morphological findings often lack specificity. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as stable molecular biomarkers, yet their diagnostic value in cadaveric samples is still unclear. This exploratory study investigated the expression of three candidate miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p) in post-mortem peripheral whole blood to assess their association with sepsis-related death versus non-infective controls. Out of 58 cases, 45 met quality-control criteria (26 sepsis-related deaths and 19 controls). miRNA expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, normalized to miR-320, and analyzed using DeltaCt values. Group differences were evaluated using linear regression models with adjustment for age, sex, and post-mortem interval, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. In adjusted models, miR-125b-5p and miR-27a-3p showed evidence of association with sepsis status, whereas miR-122-5p did not. These results support the feasibility of miRNA quantification in post-mortem samples and motivate validation in larger, independent cohorts and within multimodal post-mortem diagnostic frameworks."
41614763,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Pediatric Infections: A Systematic Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are granule- and nucleus-derived structures that support innate immunity. While the contribution of NETs to adult infections and autoimmune diseases is well studied, evidence in children is still inconsistent. This review aimed to summarize current findings on NETs in pediatric infections. METHODS: This study followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in major databases (MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus) from inception until 5 September 2025. The study quality was evaluated using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review. In respiratory disease, the role of NETs was well described and their formation correlated with severity. Patients with febrile urinary tract infections showed elevated urinary NET-associated markers. In COVID-19 infection, NET levels were unchanged in uncomplicated cases but elevated in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Findings in sepsis were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents the published evidence on NET formation in the pediatric population, assessing the current knowledge and identifying the gaps to guide research. Future studies should aim to standardize NET detection methods, evaluate their prognostic value in large prospective cohorts, and explore the various NET-associated mechanisms in children."
41614723,Use of Ondansetron for Pediatric Gastroenteritis in the Pediatric Emergency Department: An Evaluation of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of emergency department (ED) ondansetron with hospitalization with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the PECARN Registry of children with AGE. Within a sample matched on vital signs, demographics, clinical severity, imaging performance, and intravenous fluids provision, we used conditional logistic regression to assess associations between administration of ondansetron and hospitalization. We compared rates of 7-day return visits with significant diagnoses between children who did and who did not receive ondansetron on their initial encounter. RESULTS: We included 543,541 encounters, of which ondansetron was administered in 39.7%. After matching, hospital admission occurred in 11.8% and 17.7% of children who did and did not receive ondansetron, respectively, with standardized mean differences <0.1. Ondansetron was negatively associated with hospitalization (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.60-0.63). Children given ondansetron on their index visit had a higher percentage of 7-day return visits with appendicitis (absolute percentage difference, +0.05%, 95% CI: +0.03%, +0.07%), but a lower percentage of return visits with sepsis or bacteremia (-0.03%, 95% CI: -0.05%, -0.01%) compared with children not given ondansetron on their index visit. CONCLUSIONS: Children receiving ondansetron for AGE in the ED had an  approximately 40% lower odds of hospitalization. While appendicitis was diagnosed more frequently within 7 days among children given ondansetron compared with those not given ondansetron, sepsis or bacteremia were less frequently diagnosed. These findings align with prospective studies demonstrating the beneficial impact of ondansetron use in pediatric AGE."
41613598,"Bloodstream infection with NDM-1/5 Enterobacter cloacae complex in China: diverse STs, multi-virulence systems and carbapenem resistance.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the molecular epidemiology, virulence repertoire and resistance gene characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (CRECC) in bloodstream infections (BSI), thereby providing evidence for precision therapy and infection control. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 13 non-replicate CRECC-BSI isolates from January 2019 to December 2023 at a tertiary-care hospital in Shandong Province, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution; Illumina NovaSeq whole-genome sequencing was performed, and genomes were assembled with ABySS and GapCloser. ResFinder, VFDB, CGE and NCBI Pathogen Detection databases were used jointly to analyze resistance genes, virulence factors, plasmid replicons, MLST an SNP-based phylogenetic tree assessed inter-strain relatedness; while filter-mating assays determined the transferability of plasmids. RESULTS: A total of 13 CRECC isolates yielded five sequence types (STs), with ST171 predominating (46.2%, 6/13); all carried bla (NDM) (bla (NDM-1) in 9 isolates, bla (NDM-5) in 4), along with AmpC, ESBLs, and aminoglycoside/quinolone resistance genes. The IncX3 plasmid replicon was most frequent (46.2%, 6/13), followed by IncHI2/HI2A (38.5%, 5/13). Each strain harbored adherence, biofilm formation, iron/manganese transport and T6SS virulence genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed complete resistance among all isolates to cephalosporins, carbapenems and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, while amikacin, tigecycline and polymyxin B remained 100% susceptible. cgMLST revealed a polyclonal population structure. Conjugation assays demonstrated transfer of bla (NDM)-bearing plasmids to recipient Escherichia coli J53. CONCLUSIONS: Our institutional CRECC-BSI is characterized by diverse sequence types, a complex plasmid profile and a high burden of virulence genes; ST171 is the dominant clone and bla (NDM-1) the principal carbapenemase. Close surveillance of this high-risk lineage and of IncX3/IncHI2-mediated horizontal gene transfer is essential, together with strengthened infection-control and antimicrobial-stewardship measures."
41613378,"Case Report: Complete remission in a neonate with high-risk neuroblastoma harboring MYCN amplification and 1p deletion: a case for aggressive early intervention, and literature review.",2025,"Neuroblastoma is the most prevalent extracranial solid tumor in infancy and early childhood, accounting for 8%-10% of all pediatric malignancies and contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality. Its clinical spectrum ranges from spontaneous regression to aggressive metastatic disease, often influenced by underlying genetic aberrations such as MYCN amplification and chromosomal deletions (1p, 11q, and 17q). We present a rare case of a full-term male neonate diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma originating from the left adrenal gland, exhibiting both MYCN amplification and 1p deletion. The patient had extensive liver metastases and supradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy at diagnosis. Multimodal treatment, including intensive chemotherapy per the NB2004 protocol, surgical resection, high-dose consolidation chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), led to complete remission by 11 months of age. Despite severe post-transplant complications such as sepsis and enteropathy, the patient remained disease-free with normal developmental milestones at follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neonatal neuroblastoma with concurrent MYCN amplification and 1p deletion achieving favorable outcome through comprehensive multimodal therapy. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, genetic profiling, and aggressive treatment in managing high-risk neuroblastoma in neonates."
41608222,Endotoxin Hemoperfusion as an Adjuvant Therapy for Sepsis: Lessons from the TIGRIS Trial.,2025,"Despite significant advances in antimicrobial therapy and supportive intensive care, mortality in septic shock remains unacceptably high. Hemoadsorption therapies have emerged as adjunctive strategies designed to remove circulating mediators that propagate the dysregulated host response. Among these, polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) represents the most extensively studied extracorporeal modality, specifically targeting circulating endotoxin. Over three decades of investigation have produced a complex body of evidence, ranging from early promising results in small, open-label studies to large randomized trials with inconsistent outcomes. Recent findings from the TIGRIS trial, employing Bayesian design and biomarker-guided patient selection, provide compelling support for a survival benefit in a well-defined subgroup of septic shock patients with intermediate endotoxin activity. This review synthesizes the evolution of PMX-HP research, from EUPHAS through EUPHRATES and TIGRIS, highlighting lessons learned in trial design, biomarker utilization, and patient stratification. These experiences underscore the potential of precision-based extracorporeal interventions in sepsis while outlining the critical methodological and regulatory challenges that remain."
41608213,Infection-Related Preterm Birth.,2025,"Preterm birth (PTB), predominantly induced by intraamniotic inflammation, stands as the foremost contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. Fetal inflammatory response syndrome, stemming from the activation of the innate immune system, signifies the occurrence of funisitis or chorionic vasculitis. Maternal-fetal complications associated with infection-related PTB encompass maternal sepsis, fetal demise, neonatal sepsis, neonatal neurological impairment, and chronic lung disease. The inflammatory cascade is initiated when Toll-like receptors present on immune cells within the fetal membranes and the female reproductive tract encounter pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from infectious agents. Subsequently, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells facilitates the transcription of cytokines. The accumulation of neutrophils compromises the tissue integrity of the fetal membranes, leading to membrane rupture via the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Elevated prostaglandin levels prompt uterine contractions and cervical remodeling, resulting in progressive cervical effacement and dilation, ultimately culminating in fetal delivery. The diagnosis of PTB should encompass three pivotal criteria: gestational age, uterine activity, and the consequences of that uterine activity. The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis is established through a combination of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, identification of infectious microorganisms, and placental pathology. Fetal monitoring involves antenatal ultrasonography and non-stress testing. The management of infection-related PTB involves controlling and treating the infection, timing delivery to coincide with optimal fetal lung maturity, and optimizing outcomes for both the mother and neonate. Current preventive strategies for PTB primarily focus on inhibiting myometrial contractions that arise from the inflammatory cascade initiating PTB. An understanding of these pathways serves as the cornerstone for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing PTB."
41607964,Cutaneous and Systemic Complications in Primary CD8+ Aggressive Epidermotropic Cytotoxic T-cell Lymphoma.,2025,"CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma (CD8+ AECTCL) is an uncommon and highly aggressive variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by rapid systemic progression. We present the case of a 61-year-old man with CD8+ AECTCL who developed a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus port-site infection while on duvelisib following prior gemcitabine/liposomal doxorubicin therapy. The patient had been diagnosed with CD8+ AECTCL 18 months prior and presented with acute erythema, swelling, and pain over his left anterior chest. Upon admission, the patient met sepsis criteria, and his port was subsequently removed in addition to the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. During hospitalization, he developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Renal biopsy revealed diabetic nephropathy with findings consistent with renal-limited thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), likely multifactorial from gemcitabine and duvelisib exposure compounded by sepsis and underlying lymphoma. Complement studies supported the activation of the alternative pathway, and after multidisciplinary discussion, eculizumab was initiated for TMA management. The patient completed inpatient eculizumab dosing and was discharged on outpatient infusions. His cutaneous lymphoma lesions improved with a short course of oral prednisone as directed by oncology. At discharge, he was clinically stable on dialysis with plans for ongoing outpatient care; subsequent follow-up showed stable renal function. This case highlights the intersection between aggressive cutaneous lymphoma, infection, and chemotherapy-induced vascular injury, emphasizing the importance of early recognition of systemic complications in CD8+ AECTCL and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes."
41607607,Molecular Diagnosis in Culture-Negative Meningococcal Arthritis: A Case Report and Case-Based Literature Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Meningococcal arthritis is a rare manifestation of invasive meningococcal disease, accounting for 1-12.5% of cases. Accurate diagnosis relies on synovial fluid analysis, blood cultures, and molecular techniques. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old male with a history of renal and rectal cancer presented with fever, lower limb oedema, and headache. Laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers. Synovial fluid analysis was performed, and while cultures were negative, FilmArray Sepsis(R) Panel PCR was positive for Neisseria meningitidis, confirming the diagnosis of meningococcal septic arthritis. DISCUSSION: A review of nine culture-negative meningococcal arthritis cases diagnosed using molecular methods is presented. Molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly PCR, offer significant advantages over traditional culture methods, including higher sensitivity and the ability to detect pathogens after antibiotic administration. In England and Wales, meningococcal septic arthritis represented 2% of all invasive meningococcal disease cases from 2010-2020. This case highlights the importance of molecular diagnostic techniques in accurately diagnosing meningococcal arthritis, especially when traditional culture methods fail. PCR-based methods are becoming essential tools in the management of this condition, potentially revealing a higher incidence than previously recognised."
41607523,"Epidemiological characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens isolated from blood cultures in southern Jiangxi, China, 2020-2024.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the distribution characteristics and dynamic trends of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens isolated from blood cultures of adult patients at a large tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi Province, China, from 2020 to 2024, in order to provide evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of bloodstream infections. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of non-repetitive isolates from blood cultures of adult patients at a large tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi Province between 2020 and 2024. Statistical analysis was performed using WHONET 5.6 and SPSS Statistics 30 software. RESULTS: This study included a total of 3,695 pathogenic bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria predominating (61.92%,2,288/3,695). Among Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (28.99%,1,071/3,695) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.72%,544/3,695) were the most prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance analysis revealed that the detection rate of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) surged sharply from 1.2% (1/82) in 2020 to 21.8% (26/119) in 2024; the detection rate of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) increased from 33.3%(5/15) in 2020 to 76.5% (13/17) in 2024. In contrast, the detection rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decreased significantly from 24.3% (17/73) in 2020 to 13.5% (10/74) in 2024. Among Enterococci, the rate of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR, defined as resistance to 500 microg/ml gentamicin) in Enterococcus faecium increased significantly, from 10% (1/10) in 2020 to 66.7% (14/21) in 2024, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) was detected at a rate of 9.5% (2/21) in 2024. CONCLUSION: In a tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi, China, Gram-negative bacteria predominate among Patients with positive blood cultures, with sharply rising detection rates of CRKP, CRAB, and VREfm posing a public health threat. Meanwhile, the declining prevalence of MRSA indicates that infection control measures are effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, continuous surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is essential, and antimicrobial stewardship measures must be implemented immediately to curb their spread. A limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single center, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other regions."
41607500,Influence of anesthetic agent and burst suppression on postoperative delirium in elderly patients: a prospective cohort study with automated EEG analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines currently suggest considering EEG guidance during general anesthesia in elderly patients to avoid prolonged burst suppression (BS), with the aim of mitigating postoperative delirium (POD). Our study aimed to investigate the association between POD and intraoperative BS duration dependent on the general anesthetic agent used (propofol vs. sevoflurane). METHODS: In this prospective study (2019-2022), EEGs from 265 patients over 70 years undergoing general anesthesia were analyzed for intraoperative BS duration both visually and using one new automated algorithm to evaluate its accuracy. Associations between BS duration, anesthetic agent, and postoperative delirium (POD) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: BS duration was markedly shorter than in prior cohorts but did not reduce overall postoperative delirium (POD) incidence. POD occurred more frequently with sevoflurane than propofol (44% vs. 30%, p = 0.017), despite shorter median BS [0 s (IQR 0-4.9) vs. 20.6 s (IQR 0-151.7); p = 0.012]. A significant interaction between anesthetic agent and BS (p = 0.033) showed that BS under sevoflurane conferred 3.8-fold greater POD risk than under propofol. Sevoflurane plus BS increased POD odds 9.3-fold compared to propofol without BS. Our new automated BS detection algorithm demonstrated high precision (median error <2.17 s). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane markedly increased POD risk versus propofol, independent of BS duration. Sevoflurane and BS interaction amplified delirium odds. BS appears a vulnerability marker rather than a causal factor. The validated machine-learning BS detector offers a reliable tool for future EEG-based delirium risk research."
41602763,Dysbiosis and metabolic pathway shifts in the gut microbiome of children with sepsis: a comparative analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The newly published Phoenix Sepsis Score in 2024 for assessing sepsis in children mainly focuses on respiratory, cardiological, coagulation and neurological indicators, whereas the gut microbiome also plays key roles in the occurrence and progression of sepsis. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific biomarkers in gut microbiome are associated with disease progression. This study aimed to explore the differences in gut microbiome diversity, composition and function between septic and healthy children, and to establish correlations with clinical indicators and outcomes, providing new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. RESULTS: Analysis of gut microbiome was performed in 20 sepsis children and 9 healthy controls aged between 3 and 18 years old. The anal swab samples were analyzed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Significant differences were observed in alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiome between sepsis group and healthy controls groups. Especially, Shannon diversity was significantly correlated with white blood cell count, serum lactate, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay and length of hospital stay (all R > 0, p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were both dominant in most of children in SG and HC groups, while three in SG showed extremely low combined abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (<10%), which might be associated with chemistry therapy and death outcome. Bacteria associated with nosocomial infections, including genus taxa Acinetobacter, Prevotella, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and Corynebacterium, can be dominant (relative abundance>70%) in sepsis group, which were absent in healthy control group. Enterococcus abundance not only predicted sepsis risk (AUC = 0.85) but also was correlated with 28-day mortality (R > 0, p = 0.004). Gene function prediction based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated significant differences profile in SG and sepsis-deaths groups. The enriched gut microbiome genes were related to cellular proliferation, energy metabolism, signal transduction, the oxidative stress response and arginine metabolism. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in diversity, taxa composition and gene function in the gut microbiome existed between septic and healthy children. The associations between gut microbiome dysbiosis and clinical indicators were identified. Enterococcus could be a biomarker to predict sepsis risk."
41602321,Risk factors for hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and ibuprofen treatment failure in premature twins: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Premature twins face a dual challenge: a high incidence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and a poor response to ibuprofen. Current management, derived from singleton data, fails to address this population's unique risks. Our study specifically investigates risk factors for hsPDA development and ibuprofen treatment failure in preterm twins to enable personalized prevention and therapy. Thus, the potential biomarkers for the occurrence of hsPDA and ibuprofen closure failure were examined. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective case-control study. 736 twin infants born at </=34 weeks of gestation were included, of which 70 were exposed to hsPDA and 66 were exposed to ibuprofen. Clinical data were obtained from the Electronic Medical Record system. For the occurrence of hsPDA and failure of ibuprofen treatment, multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the independent risk factor and the potential biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: 1. When compared to the non-hsPDA group, the hsPDA group demonstrated markedly higher incidences of low birth weight, lower gestational age, male gender, low 5 min Apgar scores, selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), use of pulmonary surfactant, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), >/=grade III intraventricular hemorrhage, and early-onset sepsis (p < 0.05). The hsPDA group had a notably higher rate of sIUGR (28.6%) relative to the non-hsPDA group (15.2%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, in twins with sIUGR, the larger infant exhibited a higher hsPDA incidence than the non-hsPDA group (p < 0.05). 2. Univariate analysis revealed that vaginal delivery, birth weight, gestational age, male gender, 5 min Apgar score, early-onset sepsis, RDS, and sIUGR were associated with the occurrence of hsPDA (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression identified sIUGR [odds ratio (OR) = 3.337, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.301-8.560] as an independent risk factor (IRF), while a higher birth weight (OR = 0.537, 95% CI 0.437-0.660) was noted to be a protective factor (p < 0.05). 3. Compared with the successful treatment group, the treatment failure group showed higher rates of premature rupture of membranes (PROMs) > 18 h, postnatal surfactant use, and monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins (p < 0.0167, Bonferroni correction). The treatment failure group included 11 MCDA cases (73.3%), markedly more than the successful treatment group (33.3%, p = 0.006). 4. Univariate regression analysis identified gestational age, birth weight, MCDA, 5 min Apgar score, and PROMs > 18 h as factors associated with ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression revealed MCDA (OR = 4.686, 95% CI 1.070-20.530) and PROMs > 18 h (OR = 15.198, 95% CI 2.377-97.178) as IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). 5. In the pharmacological closure group, MCDA twins exhibited markedly lower closure rates after both the first and total two courses compared to dichorionic diamniotic twins (p < 0.05). MCDA twins required higher cumulative drug doses (40.21 +/- 1.27 vs. 32.21 +/- 0.53, p < 0.05), although no significant difference in the frequency of administration was detected. The MCDA group also had a higher rate of surgical interventions (39.29% vs. 10.53%, p < 0.05). 6. The NT-proBNP, Hs-cTn, PGE2, Cortisol, and TXA2 levels in the sIUGR group were markedly elevated versus those in the non-sIUGR group, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In preterm twins </=34 weeks, sIUGR is an IRF for hsPDA. In addition, MCDA and PROMs > 18 h are IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure. Meanwhile, elevated levels of NT-proBNP and Hs-cTn may play a role in the development of hsPDA in preterm infants with sIUGR."
41602249,Pyosalpinx-Induced Pelvic Sepsis Prompting Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy and Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in a Premenopausal Woman.,2025,"Pyosalpinx is a rare infection of the fallopian tube characterized by pus accumulation and inflammation, which can progress to severe sepsis if not promptly treated. We describe a 54-year-old premenopausal woman who presented with fever, localized abdominal pain, and laboratory findings consistent with sepsis. Diagnostic imaging revealed a complex adnexal mass concerning for a tubo-ovarian abscess. Despite empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the infection persisted, prompting a robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for definitive source control. Surgical pathology confirmed pyosalpinx with abscess formation. The presence of clue cells and the absence of sexually transmitted pathogens suggested bacterial vaginosis as the likely infectious source. This case emphasizes that upper genital tract infections can occur in women without traditional risk factors and that altered vaginal flora may play a significant role in their development. Prompt diagnosis, empiric antibiotic coverage, and timely surgical intervention remain crucial to prevent complications and ensure favorable outcomes."
41602112,"Risk factors, and outcomes of patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bloodstream infection: an eight-year case-case-control study.",2025,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (CRE-BSI) represents a major and urgent challenge to global public health. Some patients with CRE-BSI have a greater risk for poor clinical outcomes, thus identifying risk factors for CRE-BSI is required to determine the most at-risk populations. Here, we investigated risk factors for CRE-BSI by conducting a retrospective case-case-control study at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, between 2017 and 2024. A total of 144 patients with CRE-BSI were enrolled in this case-case-control study. Each case was matched simultaneously to a patient with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacterales BSI (CSE-BSI) and a control patient with non-Enterobacterales bacteremia in a 1:1:1 ratio. This design facilitated the analysis of risk factors and a comparison of 30-day survival outcomes among groups. Multivariable logistic regression identified distinct risk factor profiles for different infections. Surgical history emerged as an independent risk factor for Enterobacterales-BSI. Independent risk factors for CRE-BSI encompassed prior exposure to third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.94), carbapenems (OR = 3.45), quinolones (OR = 2.54), and glucocorticoids (OR = 2.55), in addition to a history of surgery (OR = 2.44) and gastric tube insertion (OR = 2.45). In-hospital mortality for CRE-BSI reached 52.8%. Furthermore, arterial catheter use (OR = 2.50) was identified as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients with CRE-BSI. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed several independent predicators of 30-day mortality: patient group (HR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.86; p = 0.04), age >/= 65 years (HR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.93; p = 0.03), respiratory diseases (HR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.54-6.51; p = 0.002), and digestive system diseases (HR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.10; p = 0.04). Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of underlying diseases, antibiotic usage, and invasive procedures is required to reduce CRE-BSI-associated mortality. Given the notable morbidity and mortality, as well as constrained therapeutic options, associated with CRE-BSI, identifying risk factors for CRE-BSI is urgently required for effective disease prevention and to develop novel therapeutic strategies."
41602009,Association between HALP score and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients: a multicenter retrospective cohort study with external validation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The HALP (Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, and Platelet) score integrates key parameters reflecting nutritional and immune status. However, its prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between HALP score and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients using two large critical care databases. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including adult patients with Sepsis-3 from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (derivation cohort, n = 12,899) and the MIMIC-IV database (validation cohort, n = 3,726). HALP was calculated as (hemoglobin x albumin x lymphocyte count)/platelet count, using first available values upon ICU admission. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models assessed nonlinear relationships between HALP and mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression models, adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and Acute Physiology Score III, evaluated survival differences between low- and high-HALP groups. Segmented Cox regression examined associations below and above RCS-derived thresholds. RESULTS: A total of 16,625 patients were analyzed. RCS analysis demonstrated significant nonlinear associations between HALP and in-hospital mortality in both cohorts (overall P < 0.001; nonlinearity P < 0.001 in eICU, P = 0.002 in MIMIC-IV), with an inflection point near 12.45. Below this threshold, each unit increase in HALP was associated with a 3% reduction in mortality risk (eICU: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99, P = 0.002; MIMIC-IV: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed significantly higher survival in the high HALP group (eICU: log-rank P = 0.005, HR 0.882, 95% CI 0.808-0.962; MIMIC-IV: log-rank P < 0.001, HR 0.723, 95% CI 0.607-0.862). Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that high HALP remained independently protective after full adjustment (eICU: HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, P = 0.017; MIMIC-IV: HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: The HALP score demonstrates robust prognostic value for predicting in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients, with consistent nonlinear relationships validated across two large databases. Its simplicity and reliance on routine laboratory parameters support potential clinical application in sepsis risk stratification."
41601683,A critically ill adolescent with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-induced hyperinflammatory shock: a case report and literature review.,2025,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can trigger life-threatening complications, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and septic shock. The overlapping clinical manifestations of these conditions pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article reports the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old female who presented with persistent high fever (40.1 degrees C), tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, along with markedly elevated inflammatory markers, meeting the diagnostic criteria for septic shock. Laboratory investigations revealed rapid, significant decreases in white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet count. A positive serum EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM test led to a suspicion of EBV-associated HLH (EBV-HLH). Prior to a definitive diagnosis of EBV-HLH, the patient was initiated on early and adequate combination therapy with corticosteroids and antivirals. This intervention resulted in rapid clinical and laboratory improvement: body temperature normalized by day 3, and peripheral blood counts gradually returned to normal. The subsequent bone marrow aspiration confirmed the HLH diagnosis, supported by elevated serum ferritin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) levels, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for HLH. The patient was discharged on a tapering regimen of oral methylprednisolone and achieved complete recovery without relapse during follow-up. This case suggests that rapidly progressive and significant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are key early indicators for distinguishing EBV-HLH from sepsis alone. Early recognition of EBV-HLH and timely initiation of combined corticosteroid and antiviral therapy can effectively control cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes in patients with favorable treatment responses, providing valuable clinical insights for managing similar severe cases."
41601678,Case Report: Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease in severe combined immunodeficiency.,2025,"Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare but fatal blood transfusion complication, with a mortality rate of 90-100%. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening primary immunodeficiency with profound cellular and humoral defects. Patients with SCID are highly susceptible to TA-GVHD. Here, we report a 4-month-old male admitted for sepsis and severe pneumonia, with pustular rash and unhealed exudative Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination site. Laboratory tests showed hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Lymphocyte subset analysis confirmed the presence of T-B+NK immunodeficiency. Mycobacterium bovis complex was detected in blood, while rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was identified in sputum and ascitic fluid. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing identified a novel interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG) nonsense mutation [NM_000206.3: c.865C>T, p.(Arg289Ter)]. To the best of our knowledge, this specific IL2RG mutation has not been previously reported. On the 33rd day of admission, the infant accidentally received non-irradiated leucoreduced red blood cells, then developed typical TA-GVHD manifestations including fever, hepatomegaly, rash and diarrhea, and high-resolution Human Leukocyte Antigen typing confirmed it. The parents chose to terminate treatment on the 69th day of admission, and the patient died after discharge. The dynamic evolution of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests in this patient is described, along with a review of the relevant literature. This report expands the mutational spectrum of IL2RG and reveal the reference value of peripheral blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts for early TA-GVHD identification."
41598217,Peak Lactate Within 24 h and Mortality in Septic Shock Patients Receiving Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Real-World Cohort from an Asian ICU (2018-2020).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Serum lactate is a key biomarker of tissue hypoperfusion and metabolic stress in sepsis. Although lactate clearance is widely recognized, many intensive care units record only a peak lactate within 24 h (pLac-24h). The prognostic value of pLac-24h among patients receiving blood purification therapy remains unclear in Asian intensive care settings. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 2018-2020 ICU dataset from MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Among 16,693 adult ICU admissions, 2506 patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as blood purification for severe sepsis or septic shock. Of these, 1264 (50.4%) had available pLac-24h data, and 27 (1.1%) also required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, APACHE II score, infection source, and CRRT/ECMO use. Discrimination was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision-curve analysis. This analysis was conducted as a predefined sub-analysis of an institutional ICU database. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 65.7 +/- 13.4 years, and 64.8% were male. Median pLac-24h was 5.1 mmol/L (IQR 3.2-8.6). The overall 28-day mortality among CRRT patients was 47.3%. Mortality rose progressively across pLac-24h quartiles (Q1-Q4: 28.9%, 39.4%, 54.7%, and 68.1%; p < 0.001). Each 1 mmol/L increase in pLac-24h independently predicted higher mortality (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.26, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for pLac-24h predicting 28-day mortality was 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), outperforming the APACHE II score (AUC 0.69, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with septic shock undergoing CRRT, peak lactate within 24 h was a strong, independent predictor of 28-day mortality. pLac-24h offers a pragmatic, readily available prognostic indicator when serial lactate measurements are unavailable, supporting its integration into bedside risk assessment in real-world Asian ICU practice."
41596113,"Phagocyte NADPH Oxidase NOX2-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Antimicrobial Defense: Mechanisms, Regulation, and Therapeutic Potential-A Narrative Review.",2025,"ROS derived from NADPH oxidase, particularly NOX2, are central to antimicrobial defense, coupling direct pathogen killing with redox signaling that shapes inflammation. This narrative review integrates recent advances on NOX2 structure, assembly, and spatiotemporal control in phagocytes, and outlines how ROS interact with NF-kappaB, MAPK, and Nrf2 networks to coordinate microbicidal activity and immune modulation. We summarize evidence that both ROS deficiency, as in chronic granulomatous disease, and uncontrolled excess, as in sepsis and severe COVID-19, drive clinically significant pathology, emphasizing the need for precise redox balance. Emerging therapeutic strategies include selective NOX2 inhibitors that limit pathological oxidative bursts, redox-modulating peptides that disrupt upstream activation cues, and Nrf2 activators that enhance endogenous antioxidant capacity, with attention to dosing challenges that preserve host defense while mitigating tissue injury. Key gaps remain in biomarker standardization, real-time in vivo ROS monitoring, and translation from animal models to patients, motivating personalized, combination approaches to redox medicine in infectious diseases."
41595830,Travel-Associated Melioidosis in Non-Endemic Regions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Background: Travel-associated melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is increasingly reported in non-endemic countries due to rising global travel. Understanding demographic, clinical, and outcome patterns of imported cases is important to improve recognition and management in settings where melioidosis is uncommon. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (last search: 24 September 2025) for case reports and case series of melioidosis diagnosed outside endemic regions and linked to travel exposure. Data were extracted on demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. We performed descriptive analyses, subgroup analyses, and Firth's penalized logistic regression to explore predictors of death. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251154559). Results: A total of 104 studies, encompassing 143 individual cases, were included. Most diagnoses occurred in non-endemic, high-income countries, especially the Netherlands (21%), France (10%), the United States (9%), and South Korea (7%). Infections were predominantly acquired in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand (39%). The mean patient age was 50.6 years, with a male predominance (78%). Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comorbidity (28%). Clinical presentations included pulmonary (33%), sepsis (27%), cutaneous (13%), abdominal (4%), and osteoarticular disease (1%). Overall mortality was 12.6% and relapse occurred in 7%. In penalized regression analyses, no baseline characteristic was statistically significantly associated with mortality; septic presentation showed an elevated point estimate for odds of death, but with imprecise estimates. Conclusions: Travel-associated melioidosis is a rare but clinically significant imported infection. Most cases followed exposure in Southeast Asia, and pulmonary disease and sepsis were the most frequent presentations. Mortality remained substantial (12.6%), and relapse was reported in 7%, underscoring the need for early recognition, appropriate therapy, and follow-up in non-endemic settings."
41590611,Benchtop NMR in Biomedicine: An Updated Literature Overview.,2025,"Background: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool in metabolomics, but it is often hindered by the high cost and technical complexity of the machines, limiting its clinical and point-of-care applications. Recent advances in benchtop NMR technology have sought to overcome these barriers by providing more compact, affordable, and user-friendly instruments. This systematic review aims to assess the potential of benchtop NMR in clinical metabolomics, highlighting its practical advantages, current applications, and technological challenges relative to high-field systems. Methods: For this systematic review we searched Web of Science and PubMed databases to identify studies employing benchtop NMR spectroscopy in clinical and biomedical applications. The review focuses on works that evaluated metabolic profiling in human and animal disease contexts, compared benchtop and high-field performance, and utilized advanced data analysis methods, including multivariate and machine learning approaches. Results: Among the 74 records identified, 15 research articles were eligible, including 11 studies involving human biospecimens and 4 studies concerning animal samples. The selected works were published between 2018 and 2025. These studies demonstrated the potential clinical utility of low-field NMR in differentiating disease states such as tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, neonatal sepsis, and chronic kidney disease, achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to high-field instruments. Conclusions: Although limited by lower sensitivity and spectral resolution, benchtop NMR represents a significant step toward the democratization of NMR-based metabolomics. Continued hardware development, improved pulse sequences, and the integration of artificial intelligence for spectral processing and modeling are expected to enhance its analytical power and accelerate its clinical adoption."
41586317,Early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of secondary bloodstream infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii in critically ill patients by machine-learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Secondary bloodstream infections (sBSI) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) are a major threat to patient safety in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to their prevalence and severity. Developing accurate predictive models is crucial for enhancing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to leverage machine learning (ML) to create a diagnostic model for predicting the risk of AB-sBSI in ICU patients and a prognostic model for assessing the associated 30-day mortality risk. METHODS: The multicenter, retrospective study enrolled 4,267 ICU patients with AB isolated from non-blood sites. Of these, 337 patients developed bloodstream infection. The analysis included 70 patients with confirmed AB secondary bloodstream infection (AB-sBSI) and 76 age and sex matched controls with non AB-sBSI. For 30-day mortality assessment, the AB-sBSI patients were categorized into non-survivors (n=39) and survivors (n=31). Demographic, microbiological, and laboratory data encompassing hematological, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were analyzed. Fourteen machine learning models were evaluated using the Deepwise and Beckman Coulter DxAI platforms with five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using five standard metrics, and the DeLong test was applied for AUC comparison. After data preprocessing, patients were enrolled to form an external validation cohort. RESULTS: The AB-sBSI risk diagnosis model, constructed with 11 features, identified red cell distribution width as the most significant predictor. The AdaBoost model outperformed both comparative models (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC) and the conventional biomarker C-reactive protein (AUC = 0.66), with AUCs of 0.937 in training and 0.786 in validation. For 30-day mortality prediction, another model based on 11 features selected lymphocyte count as the most influential variable. The AdaBoost model showed prominent efficacy, surpassing other model (Multilayer Perceptron, BernoulliNB, SGD) and achieving AUC values of 0.986 in training and 0.821 in validation. CONCLUSION: We developed two ML based models for predicting AB-sBSI risk and 30-day mortality. As a preliminary exploration, both models have been converted into accessible web tools. These tools are designed to assist clinicians in making informed decisions and promptly adjusting treatment strategies for critically ill patients."
41585247,Maternal inflammatory biomarkers and neonatal characteristics as predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Maternal peripartum inflammation may contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, yet readily available hematologic predictors are underexplored. We evaluated whether the maternal platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PWR) within 24 h before delivery, together with neonatal clinical variables, predicts BPD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary NICU in Southwest China, including all eligible mother-infant pairs with preterm birth (<37 weeks) between June 2020 and June 2024. BPD was defined per the 2018 NICHD criteria. Maternal demographics, obstetric complications, hematology (WBC, PLT, PWR, NLR, and PLR), and neonatal characteristics (gestational age, birth weight, sex, Apgar score, SGA, sepsis, and respiratory support) were abstracted from electronic records. Variables with p < 0.10 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by AUC, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, bootstrap calibration, and a nomogram was constructed. RESULTS: Among 345 pairs, 117 infants (33.9%) developed BPD. Mothers of BPD infants had higher WBC and lower PLT, yielding a lower PWR (median 18.9 vs. 23.1, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, lower maternal PWR independently predicted BPD (aOR = 0.94 per unit increase; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; p = 0.002). Additional independent predictors included chorioamnionitis (aOR = 1.94; 1.01-3.71; p = 0.046), male sex (aOR = 1.61; 1.00-2.59; p = 0.049), early-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.45; 1.04-5.77; p = 0.040), late-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.86; 1.47-5.56; p = 0.002), and mechanical ventilation >7 days (aOR = 6.74; 3.34-13.62; p < 0.001). Gestational age and birth weight were protective (per week: aOR = 0.68; 0.58-0.79; p < 0.001; per 100 g: aOR = 0.86; 0.78-0.94; p = 0.001). The final model showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.866; 95% CI, 0.827-0.905) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi (2) = 10.833, p = 0.211; bootstrap slope = 0.98). At the optimal probability threshold (0.763), sensitivity was 77.2% and specificity was 80.9%. A nomogram enables individualized risk estimation. CONCLUSION: A lower maternal PWR measured immediately before delivery, alongside established neonatal risk factors, independently predicts BPD in preterm infants. This simple hematologic marker, integrated into a nomogram, may facilitate early identification and targeted prevention strategies in high-risk dyads."
41585235,Association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is defined as the admission blood glucose level divided by the estimated average glucose derived from glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Previous studies have demonstrated that higher SHR levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the relationship between SHR and mortality risk specifically in patients with sepsis remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association between SHR and all-cause mortality among adult ICU patients with sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effects model was employed to pool relative risks (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 18.0. RESULTS: A total of 11 retrospective cohort studies comprising 37,790 participants were included. Pooled analyses showed that higher SHR levels were significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.79-2.50; I (2) = 36.3%), short-term mortality (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.77; I (2) = 0%), and long-term mortality (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.40-1.65; I (2) = 10.3%). Subgroup analyses based on follow-up duration (60 days, 90 days, and 1 year) revealed no statistically significant differences in effect size (p = 0.511), suggesting that follow-up duration was not a major source of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis indicated that studies with a higher proportion of diabetic patients showed a stronger association between SHR and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.026). The overall methodological quality of the included studies was high. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated SHR is an independent predictor of in-hospital, short-term, and long-term all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis. SHR, as a simple and valuable prognostic biomarker, may aid in early risk stratification of patients with sepsis.

41583950,"Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of Interleukin-6, C-reactive Protein, and Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells(-1), Individually and Combined, in Differentiating Candidemia from Bacteremia in Intensive Care Unit Patients.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Differentiating candidemia from bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is critical for effective treatment but is often delayed by reliance on conventional diagnostics like blood cultures. This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells(-1) (sTREM-1), individually and in combination, for distinguishing these bloodstream infections (BSIs). METHODS: This prospective observational study included 74 ICU patients with BSIs admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between September 2023 and August 2024. Biomarker levels were measured on the 2(nd) day of ICU admission. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients, 54 (72.9%) had bacteremia and 20 (27.1%) had candidemia. IL-6 and sTREM-1 levels were significantly higher in candidemia (P < 0.001), whereas CRP alone did not show discriminatory power (P = 0.981). The combined biomarker model achieved an area under the curve of 0.818, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance compared to individual markers. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and sTREM-1 are effective biomarkers for distinguishing candidemia from bacteremia, with CRP providing additional value in a multibiomarker model. This approach may enhance diagnostic precision and improve clinical decision-making in ICU settings."
41583262,Lemierre's Syndrome: A Rare but Resurging Disease.,2025,"Lemierre's syndrome is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) secondary to oropharyngeal infection, most commonly caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report the case of a healthy 22-year-old male patient who presented with a sore throat, right-sided neck swelling, and sepsis. Blood cultures revealed F. necrophorum. Imaging confirmed IJV thrombosis and multiple cavitating pulmonary nodules consistent with septic emboli. The patient was managed with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, vasopressor support, and temporary anticoagulation. He made a recovery and was discharged home to complete an extended course of antibiotics. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of Lemierre's syndrome in young adults presenting with oropharyngeal infection and systemic features of sepsis. Prompt diagnosis, prolonged anaerobic antibiotic therapy, and multidisciplinary input are vital to favorable outcomes."
41578749,Clinical Analysis of Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder After Liver Transplant.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a severe and potentially fatal complication after liver transplant, resulting from immunosuppression-driven uncontrolled lymphoid proliferation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the incidence, clinico-pathological characteristics, management, and outco-mes of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in liver transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1288 patients who underwent liver transplant between January 2015 and December 2024. Among them, 8 recipients (0.62%) were diagnosed with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder based on histopathological and clinical criteria. Baseline characteristics, clinicopathological characteristics, management, and outcome data were collected and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Age at time of transplant was 55.5 years (range, 44-62 years), and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was diagnosed at 10.5 months posttransplant (interquartile range, 7.5-28.5 mo; range, 5-44 mo). Clinical manifestations were diverse and nonspecific, with 6 having allograft involvement (75%) and 7 having detectable Epstein-Barr virus positivity (87.5%). Monomorphic B-cell posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (B-cell lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) was the most common subtype (87.5%). All recipients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder received immunosuppression reduction or withdrawal. Three patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-type received chemotherapy, 1 with central nervous system-type received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, and 1 received rituximab combined with radiofrequency ablation for liver lesions. Of the 8 recipients, 3 had remission and 5 died due to sepsis complications and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Median time from diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder to death was 2 months (range, 1.5-5.5 mo). CONCLUSIONS: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disor-der, characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, remains a serious complication after liver transplant. Early diagnosis requires a combination of Epstein-Barr virus DNA monitoring and imaging. Definitive patho-logical diagnosis and classification are essential for guiding treatment strategies, including reduction of immunosuppression and rituximab-based chemotherapy."
41573754,"Antimicrobial resistance in bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus from a provincial hospital, Cambodia, 2020-2022.",2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern. However, in Cambodia, as in other countries in the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region, the magnitude of the problem is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of AMR in common pathogens, namely Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from blood cultures at one provincial hospital, a national sentinel site for AMR surveillance, during a 3-year period. Sample processing and analysis were conducted at the hospital's on-site microbiology laboratory. Blood cultures were processed manually, and conventional methods were used for bacterial identification. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion and Etest minimum inhibitory concentration measurement, in accordance with current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Blood culture data from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 were extracted from the hospital's microbiology database and, for the AST analysis, deduplicated to include results only for the first isolate per patient per year. Of 6102 blood cultures collected, 529 (9%) were positive. The most common blood culture pathogens found were E. coli (150, 28% of positive isolates) and S. aureus (65, 12% of positive isolates). For E. coli, resistance to ceftriaxone was detected in 110/148 (74%) isolates and resistance to imipenem in 3/147 (2%). For S. aureus, 18/56 (32%) isolates were methicillin-resistant, but vancomycin resistance was not detected. These rates of resistance to first-line treatments are of concern and have the potential to negatively impact patient outcomes."
41573561,"m-EASIX (better than EASIX) predicts severe CAR T-cell toxicities, worse overall survival, and discriminates cytokine release syndrome from sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are life-threatening complications that often arise after CAR T-cell immunotherapy. Endothelial dysfunction is believed to play a central role in their development, leading to the interest in biomarker-based tools for diagnosis and differentiating these toxicities from sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate the Endothelial Activation Stress Index (EASIX) and its modified version (m-EASIX, which replaces creatinine with C-reactive protein [CRP] (mg/dL)) as early predictors of severe CRS and ICANS, as well as tools to distinguish CRS from sepsis. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy for CD19-positive hematologic malignancies (n=94) or multiple myeloma (n=23) were included. EASIX and m-EASIX scores were measured at various time points: before CAR T-cell infusion, 24-48 hours post-infusion, at CRS or ICANS onset, and after treatment for each toxicity. A comparator group of 129 sepsis patients, including 86 with hematologic malignancies, was also analyzed. RESULTS: Both EASIX and m-EASIX correlated with biomarkers of endotheliopathy, with m-EASIX showing stronger predictive power for severe toxicities and ICU admission. Higher EASIX and m-EASIX values at early time points were associated with worse overall survival (OS). Furthermore, m-EASIX accurately distinguished CRS from sepsis at symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: m-EASIX is a practical and accessible tool for the early prediction of severe CAR T-cell-related toxicities, risk stratification, and differential diagnosis from sepsis, offering potential to guide clinical decision-making and early intervention."
41573058,Is the P-wave dispersion a valuable tool in determining the atrial arrhythmia of newborn babies with sepsis?,2025,OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to ensure that newborns receive early diagnosis through P-wave dispersion (PWD) in terms of possible atrial arrhythmias on the provocative basis of sepsis. METHODS: In this prospective study twenty term sepsis and twenty preterm sepsis patients were compared with control groups with their own characteristics in terms of PWD by electrocardiography. RESULTS: The P-wave dispersion value in patients with term sepsis was determined to be statistically significant (p=0.03). There was no difference in PWD between the patient and control groups in preterms (p<0.05). Heart rate in preterm patients with sepsis was found to be statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a tendency for atrial arrhythmias in term newborn infants with sepsis. These babies should be followed by pediatric cardiology with cardiac monitoring throughout their treatment.
41567647,Preventive effect of small molecule active substances on septic cardiomyopathy after abdominal trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the preventive effects and mechanisms of active small molecules against septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) induced by abdominal trauma or abdominal-origin sepsis in animal models. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched in January 2000- May 2025 for studies assessing active small molecules in animal SCM models. The standardised mean difference ([SMD], Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to molecular categories, sepsis induction methods, and outcome measures. Methodological quality was assessed using the Systematic Review of Laboratory Animal Experiments risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled meta-analysis showed that active small molecules had an overall beneficial but heterogeneous effect on SCM (SMD = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.52-3.47, I(2) = 92.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed large but imprecise effects for polyphenols (SMD = 4.81, 95% CI: -5.25-14.87) and neutral effects for flavonoids (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -3.64-2.73). The efficacy was greater in lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis models (SMD = 2.86) compared with cecal ligation and puncture models (SMD = 0.16). Outcomes involving cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase and creatine kinase isozymes) showed consistently positive and robust effects, while functional outcomes (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction) exhibited inconsistent results. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness, while funnel plots indicated possible publication bias (Egger's test, p = 0.123). Methodological limitations, including incomplete reporting of randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment, were commonly observed. CONCLUSION: Active small molecules demonstrate generally positive yet heterogeneous preventive efficacy against SCM in animal models, with polyphenolic compounds in particular showing notable potential. Variability across molecular categories, sepsis models and measured outcomes highlights the need for standardised methodologies in future studies."
41567194,Lysophosphatidic acid: a promising biomarker for diagnosing sepsis and predicting in-hospital mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has anti-inflammatory and protective effects in sepsis, yet clinical evidence on its correlation with sepsis progression and outcomes is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the association of plasma LPA levels with sepsis development, severity, and mortality. METHODS: A total of 42 sepsis patients and 29 controls with common infections were included. Among the sepsis patients, 15 succumbed during hospitalization. Plasma LPA levels were measured, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma LPA was significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to controls, and further reduced in non-survivors. Notably, correlation analyses suggested that LPA levels were negatively correlated with neutrophil count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Multivariate regression analysis identified LPA as an independent risk factor for sepsis onset and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that LPA had a high diagnostic accuracy for sepsis (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reduced plasma LPA levels in sepsis patients are inversely correlated with infection/inflammation markers and SOFA scores. Together, these results suggest that LPA may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for sepsis, supporting its potential as a complementary tool to enhance early risk stratification and guide bedside clinical decision-making."
41564562,A Comparison of Time to Sepsis Alert and Antibiotics in Emergency Department Patients by Language Preference.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have found increases in sepsis-related mortality among patients with non-English language preference (NELP) vs. English language preference (ELP) in the inpatient setting, even after controlling for demographic, illness severity, and clinical encounter variables. It is unclear if disparities in sepsis care extend to the emergency department. OBJECTIVE: We compared time to sepsis alert and antibiotics between patients with NELP vs. ELP overall and by emergency severity index (ESI) subgroup. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, the independent variable was preferred language, and the dependent variables were time to sepsis alert (clinician-initiated vs. automatic) and antibiotics. We developed multivariable adjusted plus inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: There were no overall differences in the time to sepsis alerts or time to antibiotic administration. In the ESI 2 subgroup, NELP patients had faster time to sepsis alert than ELP patients in clinician-initiated alerts (clinician-initiated: absolute difference: 17 min; covariate +IPTW: HR: 1.76, 99.44% CI 1.22, 2.54, p < 0.001). Within the ESI 3 to 5 subgroup, among patients with a clinician-initiated alert, NELP patients had slower time to sepsis alert than ELP patients (absolute difference: 17 min; covariate +IPTW: HR: 0.64, 99.44% CI 0.44, 0.94, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: While we found no overall differences in time to sepsis alert, there were significant differences in subgroups, suggesting that language preference may be associated with triage score assignment and sepsis recognition. The lack of differences observed in time to antibiotics underscores the potential for thoughtfully designed best practice alerts to support equitable clinical practice."
41562073,Impact of absolute lymphocyte count upon admission to ICU on 28-day mortality in sepsis patients in ICU.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with high mortality and poor prognosis in critically ill patients, posing a severe threat to global public health. The first absolute lymphocyte count (FALC) upon admission to the ICU, reflecting the initial state of the immune system, has emerged as a potential prognostic indicator in various critical illnesses. However, its specific role and predictive value in assessing 28-day mortality among sepsis patients in the ICU remain incompletely understood, with existing studies showing limitations in sample size and verification dimensions. METHODS: Data of ICU patients (18<age<90) who met the sepsis diagnostic criteria (Sepsis-3 definition) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV(2.0) clinical database. Patients were grouped according to the tertiles of FALC (low, medium, high); FALC was the absolute lymphocyte count in the first complete blood count upon admission to the ICU; the outcome indicator was 28-day all-cause mortality. Baseline analysis: For measurement data, normally distributed data were described as mean +/- standard deviation, skewed distributed data as median (Q1-Q3), and count data as frequency (percentage). Differences between groups were tested using t-test, chi-square test, or non-parametric test. Survival analysis: KM method was used to draw survival curves, and log-rank test was used to compare differences between groups; Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze univariate/multivariate associations, and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Non-linear verification: RCS model was used to fit the non-linear relationship between FALC and death risk, and the linear hypothesis was tested. PREDICTIVE EFFICACY: Cox regression ROC curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the predictive value of FALC. RESULTS: The study of 10,263 sepsis patients admitted to the ICU found that FALC grouping significantly affected 28-day survival outcomes, as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. Low FALC group having a significantly higher 28-day mortality risk compared to the medium and high groups. Restricted cubic splines verified a non-linear relationship between FALC and 28-days mortality, and the ROC curve confirmed that FALC has a certain prognostic predictive efficacy. CONCLUSION: In sepsis patients, lymphopenia represents a significant high-risk factor, while the first absolute lymphocyte count (FALC) stands out as a clinically meaningful indicator. It allows for precise risk stratification of patients at the time of ICU admission, thereby enabling timely immune interventions that can effectively enhance prognostic outcomes."
41561794,Autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) following urethral sling placement: A case report.,2026,"A 39-year-old woman developed debilitating systemic symptoms following the placement of a synthetic mid-urethral sling for stress urinary incontinence. Previously in good health, she experienced sepsis and adrenal crisis immediately postoperatively, followed by persistent symptoms including fatigue, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), neuropathic pain, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic instability, and recurrent infections. Despite extensive multispecialty evaluations, no definitive diagnosis was initially reached. Laboratory testing later revealed positive ANA and mild immune dysregulation. Given her complex autoimmune history, strong family predisposition, and the temporal association with mesh implantation, her presentation was suspected to be consistent with autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). She elected to undergo surgical removal of the synthetic sling with placement of an autologous rectus fascia pubovaginal sling. Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant resolution of her symptoms, restored bladder function, and improved quality of life. This case demonstrates a temporal association consistent with ASIA, with complete symptom resolution by 3 months post-explant and sustained well-being at 1 year."
41561118,The multifaceted role of kallistatin in human diseases: mechanistic insights and translational potential.,2025,"Kallistatin, a multifunctional serine protease inhibitor, is widely distributed with tissue-specific effects. It may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human diseases. Through binding to its two structural elements and specific receptors, it regulates differential signaling cascades, and thus has a wide spectrum of biological functions. In cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure, it exerts protective effects by improving endothelial function, anti-inflammation, and regulating lipid metabolism. In liver diseases, high hepatic expression correlates with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, while decreased serum levels indicate severe cirrhosis or liver fibrosis. In metabolic diseases, it regulates insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammation. In inflammatory diseases, its role is dual: it attenuates inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, etc., but exacerbates chronic rhinosinusitis and autoimmune uveitis by promoting inflammatory cytokines secretion. In cancer, it inhibits tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, with lower tumor tissue expression linked to cancer development. Kallistatin also serves as a potential biomarker for chronic kidney disease, preterm birth, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on kallistatin's mechanisms in organ injury and repair, emphasizes its therapeutic potential across disease contexts, and discusses challenges and future directions for clinical translation, including organ-targeted strategies and combination therapies."
41561091,"Clinical and molecular features of candidemia: a three-year retrospective study in Northern Guizhou, China.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: Candidemia, a life-threatening infection with rising incidence and substantial mortality, necessitates improved management strategies. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features, species distribution, risk factors, antifungal susceptibility, and molecular epidemiology of Candida albicans isolates from candidemia patients over a three-year period. METHODS: This retrospective study included 133 patients with candidemia from a teaching hospital in Guizhou, China between December 2019 and November 2022. Clinical data were compared between C. albicans (n = 63) and non-C. albicans (NAC) (n = 70) groups. Risk factors and prognostic biomarkers were identified using logistic regression and ROC analysis. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for C. albicans isolates. RESULTS: NAC species predominated (52.6%) over C. albicans (47.4%). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 48.1%, higher in C. albicans infections. For C. albicans, hypoalbuminemia and septic shock were independent mortality risk factors, while antifungal therapy and higher platelets were protective. For NAC, septic shock and elevated serum urea were risk factors. Prognostic biomarkers included D-dimer and CRP for C. albicans, and serum urea and total bilirubin for NAC. Most isolates were antifungal-susceptible, though C. glabrata and C. tropicalis showed increased azole non-susceptibility. MLST of 48 C. albicans isolates identified 7 novel alleles and 23 new DST types. CC9 was the predominant clonal complex. CC138 and CC139 are newly reported clonal complexes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that candidemia remains a serious threat with high mortality. The distinct risk factors and prognostic biomarkers between C. albicans and non-C. albicans species indicate the need for species-specific management. Although overall resistance remains low, emerging azole non-susceptibility in key species underscores the necessity for continuous susceptibility surveillance. MLST revealed a highly diverse and evolving C. albicans population, including novel genetic lineages. Integrating molecular epidemiology with clinical data is crucial for advancing global candidemia management."
41558044,Concordance of CO2 gaps measured using peripheral and central venous blood in patients diagnosed with septic shock.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the venous-arterial CO2 difference (Pv-aCO2) from peripheral venous blood (Pv-aCO2p) as a less invasive alternative to central venous Pv-aCO2 for assessing tissue perfusion in septic shock. METHODS: A prospective, single-center study included 54 septic shock patients with central venous catheters placed within 24 h of intensive care unit admission. Blood samples from arterial, central venous, and peripheral venous sources were analyzed. Correlation analyses and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between Pv-aCO2p and central Pv-aCO2. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 70 years, and 51.9% were male. The median SOFA score was 8.5, and the mean APACHE-II score was 22.7. The Pv-aCO2p gap was 8 mmHg, whereas the central Pv-aCO2 gap was 6 mmHg. A moderate correlation was found between Pv-aCO2p and central Pv-aCO2 (r = 0.593, p < 0.001), with stronger correlations observed in patients with arterial lactate >/=2 mmol/L (r = 0.673) and hemoglobin <8 g/dL (r = 0.625). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean difference of 8.278 mmHg between arterial and peripheral pCO2. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral Pv-aCO2p correlates well with central Pv-aCO2 and can serve as a less invasive alternative for assessing tissue perfusion in septic shock patients. It offers practical utility when central venous access is not available, aiding in early clinical decisions."
41557542,Mortality and associated factors in post-stem cell transplant patients: a two-year cohort in a public hospital in Peru.,2025,"OBJECTIVE. To determine mortality and associated factors in patients who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, between January 2017 and December 2022. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 2017 and 2022. Death at one hundred days and two years, and its associated factors, were evaluated. Proportional Cox regression models were used. RESULTS. 342 post-HSCT patients were included, with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range: 10 to 39), of whom 53.5% were women. The most frequent diagnosis for the transplant was acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 54.1%. Mortality in the first 100 days post-HSCT was 8.2%, and at two years was 30.4%. In the multivariate regression at one hundred days, factors associated with a higher risk of mortality were age over 50 years (HRa: 6.97; 95% CI: 1.18-41.23), being a recipient of a haploidentical transplant (HRa: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.13-11.24), and sepsis as a complication (HRa: 68.78; 95% CI: 19.32-244.84). In the two-year analysis, acute myeloid leukemia (1.72; IC 95%: 1.08-2.74), haploidentical transplant (HRa:1.81; 95%CI: 1.21-2.72), and disease relapse (HRa: 4.17; 95%CI%: 2.75-6.31) were associated with a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS. The mortality found was low and similar to that of countries with higher incomes; however, it is necessary to formulate interventions that reduce the incidence of modifiable factors such as sepsis."
41556075,Metabolomic profiling of patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a condition characterized by acute brain dysfunction developed in the absence of a primary infection in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to perform a pilot, untargeted metabolomic profiling of the blood plasma of SAE patients to identify metabolic changes potentially associated with the pathological condition and to generate hypotheses for further studies of its pathogenesis, as well as to the search for promising biomarkers, and the assessment of the severity of the patient's condition. Metabolomic profiling was performed using HPLC-HR-MS, followed by statistical analysis of the obtained data. This blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial revealed significant differences in the metabolic profiles of the study and control groups. Functional analysis showed the metabolic pathways most affected by pathological processes in SAE patients. These included metabolism of acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and taurine, folate biosynthesis, and the drug metabolism involving the cytochrome P450 pathway. In SAE patients with impaired consciousness, including delirium and coma, decreased levels of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines were observed. The metabolomic profiles of SAE patients differed significantly between the groups of deceased and surviving patients: concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids were significantly lower in the group of deceased than in the group of survivors. Our study identified 64 candidate biomarkers that could potentially be used to predict sepsis outcomes. However, further study is needed using an expanded and independent cohort of patients."
41556021,Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case Series.,2025,"Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a rare and poorly understood manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, encompassing a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In order to highlight the diagnostic complexity and therapeutic challenges of NPSLE, this report presents the management of three distinct presentations. We retrospectively reviewed cases of three female patients with NPSLE admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment strategies, and outcomes were analyzed. Each case demonstrated unique NPSLE manifestations: acute confusional state in the setting of sepsis, cerebral vasculitis with retinal involvement, and catatonia. Treatments included high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil, with varying degrees of clinical improvement. NPSLE remains a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity and lack of definitive biomarkers. Early recognition and individualized immunosuppressive treatment are essential for improved outcomes."
41555995,Adrenal Haemorrhage in the Context of Acute Systemic Illness: Three Cases With Diverse Clinical Presentations.,2025,"Adrenal haemorrhage (AH) is uncommon and often underrecognized and may complicate severe systemic stress, infection, or coagulopathy. Prompt diagnosis is essential to exclude adrenal insufficiency and adrenal neoplasms. Three cases of AH occurring in varied clinical settings describe diagnostic approaches, management, and outcomes and draw insights for clinicians. Case 1 is a patient in septic shock hospitalised in the ICU who developed bilateral AH (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). Case 2 is about a patient admitted for chest pain, fall, and suspected infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), later found to have unilateral AH in the context of pulmonary embolism. Case 3 indicates a patient with essential thrombocythaemia and hypertension, presenting with acute abdomen after a flu-like illness, found to have a left adrenal lesion with features of haemorrhage within a lipid-rich adenoma. In all three cases, adrenal insufficiency was assessed; in two cases, steroid therapy was administered, while in one (Case 2), it was not required. Repeat imaging over months showed resolution or stability without malignant transformation. These three cases underscore the heterogeneity of AH presentations, the need for prompt endocrine evaluation, imaging follow-up, and multidisciplinary care. Recognition in atypical settings (e.g., sepsis, respiratory infection, and haematological disease) is key to preventing adrenal crisis and guiding management."
41555989,Adrenal Crisis Masquerading as Sepsis in a Patient With Autoimmune Multimorbidity: A Diagnostic Challenge on the Acute Medical Ward.,2025,"A patient in her mid-60s with autoimmune multimorbidity, including cutaneous lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), and adrenal insufficiency, presented with a five-day history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and profound fatigue. Adrenal crisis typically occurs in individuals with adrenal insufficiency during periods of physiological stress such as infection, dehydration, surgery, or inadequate steroid dosing, and should be suspected when patients develop hypotension, gastrointestinal upset, electrolyte disturbances, or fail to improve with standard therapy. Because these symptoms overlap significantly with sepsis, diagnostic confusion is common, especially in acutely unwell immunosuppressed patients, where infection is frequently presumed. Sepsis itself presents with fever, raised inflammatory markers, hypotension, and generalized malaise, mirroring many manifestations of adrenal crisis and often leading to initial misclassification. Despite correctly applying steroid sick-day rules, which involve doubling usual glucocorticoid doses during acute illness, patients may still decompensate and require escalation to parenteral emergency doses. In this case, empirical antibiotics were started for presumed sepsis after investigations revealed raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and mild hypokalemia with no clear infectious focus. However, the rapid improvement following fluid resuscitation and adjusted steroid therapy highlighted adrenal crisis as the true underlying cause. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for adrenal crisis in any acutely ill patient with known adrenal insufficiency, ensuring timely stress-dose steroid administration before pursuing alternative differential diagnoses."
41551848,Survival after cardiopulmonary arrest due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis: A case successfully managed using plasma exchange.,2026,"Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis is potentially fatal, even in immunocompetent hosts. This report describes a case involving a 57-year-old woman, who developed fever after a dog bite and initially presented without an evident focus. On the day of admission, she deteriorated to pulseless electrical activity during transport and achieved return of spontaneous circulation after approximately 23 minutes of resuscitation. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials (meropenem) were initiated for septic shock, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus subsequently grew in both the pre-admission and admission blood cultures. Peripheral discoloration suggested purpura fulminans. A precipitous decline in platelet count, schistocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and acute kidney injury fulfilled the criteria for thrombotic microangiopathy, whereas ADAMTS13 activity was normal. Intensive care consisted of red blood cell and platelet transfusions, continuous hemodiafiltration transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, and therapeutic plasma exchange once daily for three sessions. Hematological abnormalities resolved, schistocytes disappeared, organ dysfunction improved, and she was ultimately removed from ventilation and dialysis with full neurological recovery. This report describes survival after cardiopulmonary arrest due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis and suggests that plasma exchange may be a useful adjunct for secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in this setting. Early diagnosis, prompt antibiotic treatment, and multidisciplinary critical care are essential."
41551844,Prediction of hospital mortality in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury using a machine-learning approach: a multicenter study using SHAP interpretability analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) represents a critical complication with high mortality rates in intensive care units. Current risk stratification tools lack precision and interpretability for clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate interpretable machine learning models for predicting hospital mortality in S-AKI patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized five international critical care databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV (n = 12 966), MIMIC-III-CareVue (n = 2209), eICU (n = 8210), Northwestern University Intensive Care Unit (NWICU) (n = 2207) and Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb) (n = 1893). Adult patients with S-AKI meeting sepsis-3.0 and acute kidney injury criteria were included. Feature selection used the Boruta algorithm on MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-III and eICU databases. Eleven machine learning algorithms were trained using MIMIC-IV data with external validation on all other datasets. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided model interpretability. RESULTS: Among 27 485 S-AKI patients, hospital mortality was 27.5%. Boruta identified 21 consensus features including severity scores [Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OASIS], vital signs and laboratory parameters. Gradient Boosting Machine emerged as optimal with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.770 (training), 0.731 (internal validation) and 0.732-0.778 across four external validation cohorts. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and minimal overfitting (3.9% AUC difference). Decision curve analysis revealed superior clinical utility across probability thresholds of 4%-82%. SHAP analysis identified SAPS II as the most important predictor, with scores >60 and SOFA >15 associated with substantially increased mortality risk. Complete case analysis confirmed model robustness (AUC 0.766-0.847). CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning model demonstrated excellent performance and robust generalizability for S-AKI mortality prediction across five international databases. SHAP analysis provided clinically meaningful insights supporting personalized risk stratification and evidence-based clinical decision-making."
41550731,Widely targeted metabolomics and machine learning identify succinate as a key metabolite in sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment. We used widely targeted LC-MS/MS plasma metabolomics in 29 healthy controls, 32 sepsis patients, and 27 SAE patients, combined with machine learning, to define metabolic patterns across these groups. This approach identified 12 discriminatory metabolites, with succinate showing a stepwise increase from health to sepsis to SAE and associations with clinical severity scores. To test its functional relevance, we used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model and found that exogenous succinate supplementation aggravated cognitive deficits, neuronal injury, and microglial activation. Together, these findings link systemic metabolic remodeling to brain inflammation and dysfunction in sepsis and suggest that succinate and related pathways may help stratify SAE risk and provide mechanistic entry points for future therapeutic exploration."
41550645,Nanoplatforms in sepsis storm: Multimodal synergy for precision immunomodulation and pathogen neutralizations.,2025,"Sepsis, a severe global health challenge characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction stemming from a dysregulated immune response to drug-resistant pathogens, imposes a substantial disease burden. The intricate nature of sepsis necessitates meticulous drug administration and underscores the urgency for advanced drug delivery strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in nanotechnology-driven therapeutic interventions for sepsis, emphasizing innovative approaches such as stimulus-responsive and nano-drug delivery systems that have been applied to tackle sepsis and its associated complications. Drawing from various theories and mechanistic insights into sepsis pathogenesis, we explore novel therapeutic avenues and their potential integration with nano-delivery systems, considering factors such as the microenvironment. We demonstrate how these nano-delivery systems can enhance treatment accuracy and diversity. Furthermore, the synergy between nanomedicine and emerging technologies like CRISPR, CAR-T therapy, AI, microfluidics, microbiome research, and immunotherapy holds the promise to revolutionize sepsis diagnosis, treatment, and management strategies. However, overcoming pathogen resistance, precisely modulating excessive immune response/immunosuppression, and achieving efficient targeted delivery of nanocarriers in complex pathological environments remain core challenges. Future research needs to focus on the development of smarter and more responsive nanoplatforms and deeply explore their deep integration with multiple cutting-edge technologies in order to advance the clinical translation of precision sepsis diagnosis and treatment."
41550605,Platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio stratifies surgical risk and mortality in necrotizing enterocolitis neonates with portal venous gas.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Portal venous gas (PVG) represents a severe complication of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), typically signaling disease progression and a poor prognosis. While PVG has traditionally been regarded as an indication for surgical intervention in NEC, accumulating clinical evidence indicates that not all cases require operative management. Currently, surgical decision-making for NEC neonates with PVG primarily relies on subjective clinical assessments by physicians, resulting in substantial management uncertainty. The platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio (PCR), an objective and convenient biomarker integrating information on disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated predictive value in neonatal sepsis and other conditions. However, the utility of the PCR has not yet been explored in NEC-PVG patients. This study retrospectively evaluates the predictive value of the PCR for surgical intervention and prognosis in this high-risk population, aiming to facilitate early identification and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed 186 neonates diagnosed with NEC (Bell stage >/= IIa) and ultrasonographically confirmed PVG (2021-2024). We evaluated the PCR, calculated at the time of PVG diagnosis, for predicting surgical intervention and 30-day mortality by employing multivariate logistic regression (which included collinearity assessment and bootstrap validation) to identify independent factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess predictive performance and determine optimal cutoff values, supplemented by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort demonstrated a surgical intervention rate of 37.10% (69/186) and a 30-day mortality of 13.98% (26/186). Multivariate analysis identified the PCR as an independent predictor for both surgical intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.86) and mortality (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.92). ROC curve analysis established PCR thresholds of </=4.84 x 10(9)/mg for surgical intervention (AUC 0.84; sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%) and </=2.57 x 10(9)/mg for mortality prediction (AUC 0.80; sensitivity 69%, specificity 91%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the PCR is a promising predictor of surgical intervention and mortality risk in NEC-PVG patients, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to individual parameters. Based on these findings, we propose the incorporation of PCR testing into standard clinical monitoring protocols, using 4.84 x 10(9)/mg as a potential cutoff value to inform therapeutic decision-making. This approach may improve the clinical management and outcomes in this high-risk population."
41547600,Analysis and comparison of the difference between two major blood culture system in the laboratory and neonatal intensive care unit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a critical health concern that demands accurate and timely diagnosis. Blood culture, the gold standard, is challenging in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants because of the limited blood volume and potential aerobic culture limitations. The VersaTREK (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) blood culture system, which requires less blood and offers both aerobic and anaerobic cultures, presents a potential solution. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance with the widely used BD (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) blood culture systems for neonatal sepsis patients. METHODS: We conducted a three-step study, including in vitro testing of common pathogens, prospective observational cohort data from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and a head-to-head comparison. VersaTREK's blood culture bottles include aerobic and anaerobic media, whereas BD uses a specialized bottle for aerobic cultures. RESULTS: In phase 1 of this in vitro comparison study, VersaTREK outperformed BD, particularly at low bacterial loads. In phase 2, a prospective observational cohort analysis revealed a significantly greater yield with VersaTREK, especially for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria. In phase 3, a head-to-head comparison demonstrated comparable performance between the two systems, with potential advantages for VersaTREK in scenarios involving minimal blood volumes, as little as 0.1 mL. CONCLUSIONS: The VersaTREK and BD blood culture systems demonstrated similar diagnostic performance, with VersaTREK capable of detecting as little as 0.1 mL of blood. While this is promising in scenarios with minimal blood volume, further investigations with larger sample sizes are needed."
41542729,Impact of preoperative anemia on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a multi-institutional retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) involves unique physiological challenges, including single-lung ventilation, that may amplify the effects of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity in anemic patients. Despite the minimally invasive nature of VATS, the specific impact of preoperative anemia on outcomes following these procedures remains inadequately characterized. METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study using TriNetX research network data (2010-2024). Adults undergoing VATS with preoperative hemoglobin measurements were included. The anemia group (hemoglobin 8-12 g/dL) was compared to the control group (hemoglobin >/=12 g/dL) using 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS: After matching, 8,346 pairs of patients were analyzed. Patients with preoperative anemia had significantly higher 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-4.39, P<0.0001) (primary outcome), intensive care unit admission (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.27-1.67, P<0.0001), acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.58-2.32, P<0.0001), pneumonia/respiratory failure (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53-1.95, P<0.0001), and sepsis (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36-2.36, P<0.0001). These associations remained consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to academic medical centers, patients without blood transfusions, and those with stable hemoglobin levels throughout the perioperative period. Sex-specific analyses revealed higher risks of respiratory complications, AKI, sepsis, and deep vein thrombosis in males, while females with anemia demonstrated higher mortality risk. Even mild anemia was associated with significantly increased complications. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative anemia is strongly associated with adverse outcomes following VATS, with an over threefold increased mortality risk. These findings highlight the importance of preoperative anemia assessment and management in patients undergoing VATS."
41541878,Comparison of admitting neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio with baseline NIH stroke scale score in discriminating poor 30-day stroke outcome among Nigerian Africans.,2025,"AIM: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is an established marker of stroke severity. Its use is time-consuming and requires formal training for optimal results. In contrast, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), known to be independently associated with stroke outcome, can be readily calculated from routine peripheral blood counts with minimal training. We hypothesized that the NLR may perform similarly to the NIHSS score, in discriminating persons with poor 30-day stroke outcome, in a low-resource setting. METHODS: We followed up 106 participants with clinico-radiologic diagnosis of first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients with clinico-laboratory features of fever, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, or infection were excluded at baseline. The NLR was obtained at admission while the functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at day 30. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and Cox proportional hazards were used to determine the discriminatory ability of the NLR compared with the NIHSS score in identifying patients with poor 30-day stroke outcome (mRS > 3). The respective areas under the curves (AUC) and HRs (95%CI) were documented. RESULTS: The median interquartile range (IQR) NLR of the study population was 2.87 (3.0). Patients in the higher tertiles of NLR had higher mean standard deviation 30-day mRS scores of 4.9 (1.2) compared to the middle 3.3 (1.2) and lower tertiles 2.3 (1.2) (p < 0.001). Admitting NLR had an AUC (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.75-0.91) and HR (95%CI) of 1.19 (1.01-1.40) compared to admitting NIHSS score with AUC of 0.89 (0.84-0.95) and HR of 1.25 (1.14-1.37) in discriminating poor 30-day outcome. CONCLUSION: The NLR alone performed similarly to the NIHSS score and may help identify patients with adverse 30-day AIS outcome in low-resource settings."
41541174,A case report of complete penoscrotal transposition and associated anomalies in a newborn.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Penoscrotal transposition is a rare congenital abnormality in which the scrotum is positioned above the penis. It results from the disrupted development of the genital tubercle and labioscrotal folds. The exact embryological errors are not fully understood, but they may arise from a failure in their migration and fusion around 12 weeks of gestation. CASE PRESENTATION: A term male newborn was referred 4 h after birth due to respiratory distress, abnormal genitalia, and failure to pass meconium or urine. He had pulmonary hypertension, early-onset neonatal sepsis, complete penoscrotal transposition, and possibly an anorectal malformation. Evaluation showed elevated creatinine, hyperkalaemia, leucocytosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Despite supportive care-including antibiotics, fluids, correction of hyperkalaemia, and sildenafil-he deteriorated and died before surgery. The final diagnosis was a complex congenital anomaly, sepsis, and multiorgan failure leading to death. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Persistent scrotal transposition is associated with midline defects, including anorectal, cardiac, and gonadal anomalies. Early prenatal imaging and thorough postnatal assessments-such as echocardiography, renal imaging, and genetic testing-are essential. The complexity of this anomaly requires organised, multidisciplinary management. By focusing on key investigations and prompt interventions, even with limited resources, outcomes can be enhanced and future diagnostic and prognostic strategies improved. CONCLUSION: A rare complete penoscrotal transposition with multiple anomalies and sepsis highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care and enhanced antenatal screening."
41541165,Gallbladder ascariasis complicated by chronic eosinophilic cholecystitis in a one-year-old infant: A case report.,2025,"INTRODUCTION & IMPORTANCE: Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the most prevalent soil-transmitted helminths, affecting up to 1.2 billion people worldwide. Although it mainly inhabits the intestine, migration to the biliary system can occur. Gallbladder involvement is exceptionally rare, particularly in children. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a one-year-old male with recurrent fever, anorexia, vomiting, and weight loss for three months. Past history included neonatal intensive care for hypoplastic lungs, anemia, and sepsis. Examination revealed mild epigastric and right hypochondrial tenderness. Laboratory results showed eosinophilia, and stool analysis confirmed Ascaris ova. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, and a hyperechoic mobile lesion suggestive of Ascaris. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Gallbladder ascariasis is extremely uncommon in infants, with only two previously reported cases under one year of age, which were managed conservatively. Clinical features are nonspecific, overlapping with other gastrointestinal disorders. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice, revealing typical hyperechoic intraluminal structures. In this case, laparoscopic cholecystectomy confirmed a degenerated worm with chronic eosinophilic cholecystitis. While conservative management with anthelmintics is standard, surgery is indicated for complications such as cholecystitis or worm impaction. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, Ascaris lumbricoides may migrate into the gallbladder, resulting in symptomatic cholecystitis. In endemic regions, gallbladder ascariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained gastrointestinal or biliary symptoms. Early recognition through a high index of suspicion and timely ultrasonographic evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management. Peripheral eosinophilia, reflecting the host immune response to parasitic infestation, may provide an additional diagnostic clue."
41541133,Local soft tissue dissemination of large joint septic arthritis: A report of two cases.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Septic arthritis (SA) is a surgical emergency that can result in joint destruction and systemic sepsis. Local soft tissue dissemination of native joint SA leading to necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare but devastating complication associated with poorer outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two adult patients with poorly controlled diabetes who developed SA complicated by NF-one affecting the knee and posterior leg, the other the shoulder and anterior arm. Both required multiple joint washouts, serial wound debridements, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. One patient sustained extensive soft tissue loss necessitating coverage with a biodegradable temporising matrix (BTM) followed by split-thickness skin grafting. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: These cases highlight the clinical course of this rare but severe complication and emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and timely surgical intervention. We also outline a practical diagnostic and management framework, including antimicrobial selection post-arthrocentesis, the role of pre-operative imaging, and the rationale for selecting arthroscopic versus open joint debridement. CONCLUSION: SA complicated by NF is a life- and limb-threatening condition that presents numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and a multidisciplinary approach incorporating empirical antibiotics, targeted imaging, and prompt surgical management are essential to optimise outcomes."
41538518,In vitro and in vivo studies on the activity and selectivity of butoconazole in experimental infection by Trypanosoma cruzi.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (CD). There are two drugs available for the treatment with limited efficacy, especially in the later stage. Focusing on drug repurposing by virtual screening of chemical databases, butoconazole (BTZ) was identified as promising hit. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore the trypanosomicidal effect of BTZ alone or in combination with benznidazole (BZ) against T. cruzi. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our in vitro assays validated the low cytotoxicity of BTZ and high potency on amastigotes (EC50 = 0.07 muM), being 24-fold more potent than BZ. Washout assays demonstrated the sterilisation capacity of BTZ, whereas its combination with BZ gave an additive interaction (xƩFICI = 0.66). In a mouse model of acute T. cruzi infection, BTZ was unable to suppress parasitaemia but ensured the animal survival. BTZ plus BZ reduced parasitaemia and provided higher survival rates than monotherapies. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that BTZ + BZ protocol gave 100% of lack of parasitological cure, as parasite satDNA was amplified in the heart of all surviving animals. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our dataset reinforces the relevance of drug repurposing and combination strategies to advance into the development of novel therapeutic approaches for CD."
41537617,[Experience of using mineral waters in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for the correction of endotoxinemia].,2025,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, special attention has been paid to the role of endotoxemia in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory processes and vascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) - increased levels of circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Endotoxemia occurs due to increased permeability of the intestinal barrier (""leaky gut syndrome"") and/or decreased activity of its elimination systems. Correction of endotoxemia is a promising direction in the complex therapy of DM1. Traditional approaches include strict glycemic control and the use of certain pharmacological agents, however, the search for effective non-pharmacological methods, such as the use of natural mineral waters, remains relevant. Despite the theoretical background, data on the effect of a course of mineral water intake on markers of endotoxemia and systemic inflammation in patients with DM1 are extremely limited. AIMS: to evaluate the effect of mineral waters on the state of LPS-binding systems, the level of circulating lipopolysaccharide and markers of inflammation in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 53 patients with a verified diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The intervention group (n=25), in addition to standard DM1 therapy, received non-carbonated therapeutic table mineral water ""Krymskaya mineralnaya"" produced by JSC ""Beer and Alcohol Plant ""Crimea"" for 150-200 ml 3 r/d. The second group was a control group, and consisted of 28 patients who were comparable in gender and age to the experimental group. ELISA kits were used to determine the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), zonulin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), including apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) manufactured by Cloud Clone Corp. (Wuhan, Hubei, China). RESULTS: In patients of group 1, after the use of mineral waters, a significant decrease in circulating LPS (p=0.029) and apoB-100 (p=0.002) was detected, as well as a statistically significant increase in LBP (p=0.009). There were no significant changes in the studied indicators in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that a 30-day course of taking ""Krymskaya"" mineral water in addition to standard insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus leads to a statistically significant decrease in the level of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key trigger of endotoxemia and chronic inflammation. The results obtained justify the expediency of further studying the use of mineral waters, in particular bicarbonate-chloride-sodium, as a component of complex non-pharmacological therapy aimed at correcting endotoxemia and improving the metabolic profile in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus."
41537293,Bloodstream infections caused by Bacteroides and Phocaeicola: clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility. Presentation of twenty-four cases.,2025,"Introduction: Anaerobic bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli are rare, but the mortality rate remains high. Increasing resistance complicates treatment strategies. Aim: This study aimed to assess the clinical and microbiological characteristics of BSIs caused by Bacteroides spp. and related genera, and to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains in adult patients hospitalized in a multidisciplinary Polish hospital over a 10-year period. Materials and methods: A retrospective, observational, single-center study included adult patients diagnosed with anaerobic BSIs between 2014 and 2023. Microbiological identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated via gradient diffusion assay and interpreted according to EUCAST. Results: Anaerobic BSIs caused by Bacteroides spp. and Phocaeicola spp. were identified in 24 patients (mean age: 65.6 years). B. fragilis was the most common isolate (62.5%). Mortality among these hospitalized patients was 46%, with a significantly higher risk observed in elderly patients (median age of deceased: 83 years). All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and carbapenems; 25% showed resistance to clindamycin. Discussion: The study confirmed high mortality, significant age-related risk, and variable antimicrobial susceptibility. Notably, Bacteroides-related BSIs often originated from gastrointestinal and urinary sources and were associated with chronic comorbidities, including renal failure. Conclusions: Empirical treatment regimens must consider increasing resistance among anaerobes. Timely microbiological diagnostics, including anaerobic cultures and susceptibility testing, are essential to guide therapy and improve patient outcomes. Significance: This study underscores the necessity for ongoing surveillance of anaerobic BSIs and highlights gaps in empirical treatment practices, advocating for broader clinical awareness and targeted antimicrobial stewardship."
41537291,Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage versus surgical resection for the treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Colonic diverticular disease (diverticulosis) is a currently worldwide increasing gastrointestinal disorder with a particularly high prevalence in Western countries. The operative treatment of acute diverticulitis could be executed through open or laparoscopic techniques. A non-resectional procedure, namely laparoscopic peritoneal lavage (LPL) and drainage, has also been adopted as a less invasive treatment strategy to treat patients with diverticular perforation and purulent peritonitis.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The present work was conducted to pool the currently available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of LPL for the treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis.&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The analysis included studies that compared patients who underwent LPL to those who underwent surgical resection. Fifteen articles were eligible for this review after searching the Scopus, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The meta-analysis demonstrated that operative time and blood loss were significantly lower in the LPL group (p&lt;0.001). The rates of overall morbidity and reoperation were comparable in the two groups (p = 0.57 and 0.74, respectively). There were significantly lower rates of cardiovascular (p &lt; 0.001) and respiratory complications (p = 0.01), incisional/parastomal hernia formation (p = 0.02), ICU admission (p &lt; 0.001), length of hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001), permanent stoma formation (p &lt; 0.001), and mortality (p &lt; 0.001), and higher rates of sepsis (p = 0.03), intra-abdominal abscess formation (p &lt; 0.001), and postoperative recurrence (p &lt; 0.001) in the LPL group.&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Compared to the colon resection procedures for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis, laparoscopic peritoneal lavage had comparable overall morbidity and reoperation rates and lower rates of permanent stoma formation and mortality. Still, there is concern regarding the recurrence and intra-abdominal abscess formation."
41536855,Evaluating the effect of probiotics on severe necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation in England and Wales: a propensity-matched population study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. This study aimed to examine whether probiotics reduce the risk of severe NEC and other key neonatal morbidities including late onset sepsis and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study using the United Kingdom National Neonatal Research Database. Infants <32 weeks gestation in England and Wales (01/01/2016-31/12/2022) were included if alive on day four, without major congenital anomaly. A propensity score matched approach was applied matching for gestational age cohorts, birth year epochs and 17 further items. Comparators were infants who were exposed or not to probiotics within 14 days. Primary outcome was severe NEC (confirmed at laparotomy or postmortem or listed primary cause of death). Parent focus groups and former NICU patients supported this study but did not contribute to design or writing. FINDINGS: 48,048 infants (45.2% (21,695/48,048) female), median gestational age 29.4 weeks (IQR 27.4-30.9) were included; 25.3% (12,161/48,048) were exposed to at least one of five available probiotics. 3.6% (1728/48,048) had severe NEC. Of 16,586 infants (8293 exposed and 8293 unexposed) in the propensity-matched analysis, incidence and odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) for exposed versus unexposed for severe NEC was 3.3% versus 4.2%, OR 0.80 (0.72-0.89); other definitions of NEC yielded similar results. Incidence for late onset sepsis (10.8% versus 11.5%, OR 0.94 (0.90-0.97)) and survival to discharge (96.6% versus 94.2%, OR 1.76 (1.65-1.88)). In infants <28 weeks gestation, severe NEC (8.7% versus 9.8%, OR 0.88 (0.82-0.93) and for >/=28 weeks (1.0% versus 1.7%, OR 0.59 (0.47-0.73). INTERPRETATION: Probiotics were associated with a reduction in severe NEC including in those <28 weeks gestation. We currently recommend neonatal units not already using probiotics, to consider the introduction of products meeting appropriate recommendations, in the context of their local morbidity rates.

41531628,"Sequential Folliculitis, Paraspinal Myositis, and Septic Arthritis Due to Hematogenous Staphylococcus aureus Infection in a Patient Receiving Adalimumab Therapy.",2025,"Skin infections are a well-recognized source of bacteremia and can serve as foci for hematogenous spread leading to sepsis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. Immunosuppressive therapies, particularly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors such as adalimumab, predispose patients to severe infections and are associated with increased infectious morbidity and mortality. These agents impair innate immune signaling and may attenuate the clinical manifestations of infection. Specifically, TNF-alpha blockade disrupts downstream interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathways that mediate leukocyte recruitment and the febrile response. Consequently, patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors may present with bacteremia or early sepsis in the absence of typical findings such as fever or leukocytosis, potentially delaying diagnosis and treatment. We report a middle-aged Caucasian male patient receiving adalimumab therapy who initially presented to the emergency department with presumed paraspinal muscle strain and degenerative spondylosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was interpreted as consistent with muscular strain and degenerative spondylosis. Subsequent orthopedic evaluation revealed a septic-appearing left knee, with synovial and blood cultures positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Further review of his history revealed that he had been treated for folliculitis over the occipital scalp one week prior to presentation, suggesting hematogenous dissemination from a cutaneous source. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and atypical presentation, we conclude that bacteremia secondary to folliculitis resulted in occult paraspinal myositis mimicking a muscle strain, and ultimately progressed to septic arthritis. This case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion for hematogenous infection in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors who present with musculoskeletal pain and minimal systemic findings."
41529007,"Trends in neonatal sepsis: bacteriological profile, and antibiotic resistance pattern at a tertiary care hospital in Egypt.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening bloodstream infection that occurs within the first 4 weeks of life and represents a significant cause of illness and death, especially in developing countries. Regular assessment of the local causative agents and their resistance patterns is important for effective management. This study aimed to determine the microbiological profile of neonatal sepsis and its antibiotic resistance patterns. METHODOLOGY: Our study was conducted on 237 neonates suspected of sepsis. Blood samples were collected and inoculated into BACT/ALERT blood culture bottles. Bacteria causing positive blood cultures were identified conventionally and confirmed to the species level using MALDI-TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns were identified using the disk diffusion method in combination with the VITEK(R) 2 compact system. Data analysis was performed using version 28 of SPSS software. RESULTS: The overall rate of neonatal sepsis was 33.8% (80/237). Of these, 54 (67.5%) and 26 (32.5%) were caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae 38 (47.5%) was the dominant causative pathogen, followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) 24 (30%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensively drug resistance (XDR) were detected in 82.5% and 10% respectively. An alarmingly high incidence of carbapenem-resistance (90.7%) was detected among Gram-negative bacteria. Methicillin resistance was detected in S. aureus and CoNS in 100% and 54.2%, respectively. Tigecycline was the most effective antibiotic for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that neonatal sepsis is mostly caused by MDR pathogens, predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae, urging revised empirical treatments and stricter infection control measures."
41529006,Predictive value of blood gas parameters and hematologic indices on survival in critically ill sepsis patients.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an excessive immune response to infection, leading to severe tissue and organ damage. In resource-limited settings, early, low-cost, and readily available laboratory parameters may guide outcome prediction. This study aimed to evaluate the role of hematological indices and laboratory parameters in predicting mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study included adult sepsis patients admitted to the ICU between January 2018 and December 2023. Blood samples obtained within the first 6 hours of ICU admission were processed using standardized analyzers. Demographic data, laboratory results at admission, length of hospital stay, and mortality status were retrieved from the hospital database. Associations between hematological indices, laboratory parameters, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were included; 40 died during hospitalization. No significant association was found between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), or platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mortality (NLR: p = 0.834, LMR: p = 0.895, PLR: p = 0.192). In contrast, pH levels showed a strong negative correlation with mortality (p < 0.001), while lactate levels were significantly positively correlated (p = 0.006). Carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels were not significantly related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Low pH and high lactate levels were the strongest predictors of mortality in sepsis patients, highlighting the prognostic value of simple blood gas parameters, especially where advanced diagnostics are limited. Hematological indices showed no significant association with mortality. pH and lactate should be prioritized in clinical decision-making for sepsis patients."
41529005,Prediction of mortality by nSOFA Score for late-onset sepsis in very low birth weight infants.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment are of great importance. This study aims to evaluate the role of the Neonatal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (nSOFA) score in predicting the causal agents and outcomes of late-onset sepsis in preterm neonates. METHODOLOGY: In this single-center, retrospectively designed study, nSOFA scores of preterm infants born before 32 gestational weeks and weighing under 1500 g with a diagnosis of culture-proven late-onset sepsis (LOS) were compared at different timepoints in relation to mortality. RESULTS: Thirteen of 117 preterms included in the study died. At all the timepoints examined, the median nSOFA score was found to be higher in the mortality group (all p < 0.001). A 3.5 cutoff value of nSOFA showed the best differentiation, with AUC = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00), 100% sensitivity, and 91.4% specificity. When nSOFA scores were compared in patients grouped as gram-positive sepsis and gram-negative sepsis, scores at T0, T6, T12, and T24 timepoints were determined to be significantly higher in the exitus group (all p < 0.008). In preterm infants born before 28 gestational weeks, mortality was predicted with the 3.5 cutoff value at T6, T12, T24, and T48 timepoints (AUC = 0.947, 0.943, 0.972, and 0.940, respectively, all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the nSOFA score is useful for predicting sepsis-related mortality in preterm infants and correlates with the severity of gram-negative sepsis."
41527652,A Rare Case of Streptococcus equi Infection: A Report and Brief Review of the Literature.,2025,"We present a rare case of Streptococcus (S.) equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ) bacteremia in a 73-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, pulmonary embolism, and recent left knee total arthroplasty who developed fever and sepsis complicated by septic arthritis of a prosthetic knee and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood cultures grew S. equi in four out of four bottles, and history revealed frequent horse exposure, suggesting zoonotic transmission with hematogenous seeding of the prosthetic joint. The diagnosis was further challenged by systemic computed tomography (CT) abnormalities and the concurrent DVT, which initially obscured the infectious source. The patient was treated with three days of piperacillin-tazobactam before de-escalation to intravenous ceftriaxone for six weeks, followed by 6 months of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, which was then extended for an additional 12 months based on clinical response. SEZ causing prosthetic joint infection is exceptionally rare, and this case underscores the importance of recognizing zoonotic pathogens as potential causes of hematogenous prosthetic joint infections, particularly in immunocompromised hosts."
41525335,Role of Sepsis Markers as Potential Biomarkers for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"GOALS: This study aimed to investigate whether sepsis markers act as biomarkers of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). BACKGROUND: The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is advantageous. This prospective observational study investigated whether the sepsis markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), presepsin (PSEP), procalcitonin (PCT), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), act as biomarkers of UC and CD. STUDY: Patients with UC or CD underwent endoscopy and assessment of the abovementioned sepsis markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leucine-rich alpha 2 glycoprotein (LRG). We prospectively examined the association of these markers with clinical activity and endoscopic scores, including the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with UC and 49 patients with CD were enrolled. MES significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in patients with UC. SES-CD significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, and PTX3 in patients with CD. In UC, MES to 3 groups showed significantly higher LRG, CRP, and IL-6 levels than the MES 0 to 1 groups. The LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 levels were significantly higher in the SES-CD >/=3 group than in the SES-CD </=2 group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 in UC and IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in CD are potential biomarkers. Overall, our findings could promote better management of IBD."
41523750,Multiple Cerebral Infarctions and Clinically Mild Encephalitis/Encephalopathy with a Reversible Splenial Lesion Associated with Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome: A Case Report.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rapidly progressing, fatal disease. Sepsis can be complicated by multiple cerebral infarctions, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), and sepsis-related encephalopathy, resulting in a poor prognosis. To our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of sepsis complicated by both multiple cerebral infarctions and MERS. We report a case based on a literature review. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 49-year-old man who experienced fever and a sore throat for 2 weeks prior to his visit. He was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Two days prior to his visit, he was confused and was transported to his previous hospital, where he was diagnosed with sepsis and treated conservatively. Although his confusion had improved the day before coming to the hospital, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple cerebral infarctions, and he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care. At the time of transfer, high signal intensity observed in the splenium of the corpus callosum on MRI was thought to be MERS. Blood tests revealed septic coagulopathy. He received intensive care and was discharged home on day 32. Head MRI performed during outpatient follow-up on the 15th day after discharge, we made a definitive diagnosis of MERS. CONCLUSION: We encountered a very rare case of STSS complicated by multiple cerebral infarctions and MERS, which had a favorable prognosis. The associations among sepsis, multiple cerebral infarctions, and MERS remain poorly understood, and further investigation is warranted."
41523449,"A Life-Threatening Case of Severe Leptospirosis in Wales, UK: Recognising Severe Disease in Non-endemic Settings.",2025,"Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that is uncommonly seen in the United Kingdom. It is typically associated with occupational exposure among sewage workers, farmers, veterinarians and abattoir employees. The illness is known by other terms such as seven-day fever, haemorrhagic fever and Weil's disease. The prevalence of leptospirosis outside of the United Kingdom is well documented, however it remains relatively uncommon to be encountered in hospitals inside the UK. While the majority of cases encountered are mild, severe disease with jaundice and acute renal failure has been described, highlighting the importance of clinician awareness in non-endemic settings.  We summarise the case of a 54-year-old male with a two-week history of malaise, fevers and oliguria who was initially treated for sepsis of unknown origin. The patient rapidly deteriorated and was admitted to ITU for haemofiltration whilst further investigations took place to establish a diagnosis."
41521413,Introduction to the 2024 Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Neutropenic Fever in Patients with Cancer: Principles & Practice of Neutropenic Fever.,2025,"This is the introductory chapter to the 2024 Australasian Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Neutropenic Fever in Patients with Cancer, an update of the Australian consensus guidelines published in 2011. These guidelines reflect the new treatment paradigms for cancer care (such as immunotherapy, bispecific antibodies, oral targeted therapies and CAR T) given the changing risks of neutropenic fever and sepsis, the emerging challenges of antimicrobial resistance and the new models of care for managing neutropenic fever. The scope of these guidelines has been broadened to include paediatrics for the first time. Further, chapters are dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention, and consumer engagement and education. Recognising the longstanding challenges about decision-making in the setting of recurrent or persistent neutropenic fever, a new chapter provides guidance about antimicrobial management and investigations. This current chapter introduces the rationale for these guidelines, defines key terms used, including risk assessment, provides an overview of the key principles suitable for a systems approach to the prevention and management of infections in neutropenic patients with cancer, defines the target audience and scope of each chapter, and helps readers navigate the guidelines. We also outline the approach to guideline development, review and feedback."
41521406,Consensus guidelines for initial management of neutropenic fever.,2025,"This update of the Australasian consensus guidelines for the initial empiric management of neutropenic fever occurs in the context of major changes in cancer treatment paradigms, as well as advances in the management of sepsis and new models of care for infections since the last version of these guidelines in 2011. Acknowledging the important role of antimicrobials in the disruption of the gut microbiome and emerging antimicrobial resistance, as well as the changing epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance more broadly, these guidelines address current evidence for optimal empiric neutropenic fever therapy. A writing group - including adult and paediatric representatives across infectious diseases, microbiology, haematology, transplant and oncology, as well as across craft groups, including medicine, nursing and pharmacy - was developed to produce and address key management questions. This was overseen by a steering committee, which included consumer representation. Using an extensive review of the literature, these guidelines provide consensus recommendations with evidence grading for initial empiric management of neutropenic fever in adults and children, including recommended investigations, antimicrobial therapy and approach to patients with beta-lactam allergy or risk factors for multidrug-resistant infection. Management beyond the first 72 h is discussed in separate chapters of this issue: the Subsequent Management (for high-risk neutropenic fever) and Ambulatory Management (for low-risk neutropenic fever) chapters."
41520250,Comparison of bacteraemic & non-bacteraemic brucellosis: A retrospective analysis of 2 years.,2025,"Background & objectives Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease that affects both humans and animals, with diagnosis traditionally confirmed by bacteriological culture of blood or tissue samples. This study aimed to identify clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory parameters that predict culture positivity in brucellosis cases. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-centre study including 130 patients with brucellosis diagnosed between January 2023 and December 2024. Patients were classified as bacteraemic (n=60) and non-bacteraemic (n=70). Demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory parameters, and treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results Patients with bacteraemia had higher rates of summer admissions, more frequent exposure to animal husbandry, and shorter symptom duration. Clinical manifestations such as back pain, headache, weight loss, and abdominal pain were more common in them. Laboratory findings showed lower leukocyte and, neutrophil counts, lower haemoglobin, lower platelet counts, in bacteraemic patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in bacteraemic vs non-bacteraemic patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that AST had the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.841, 95% CI: 0.758-0.924), with an optimal cut-off of 27.3 U/L, yielding 67.2 per cent sensitivity and 84.1 per cent specificity. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that exposure history (OR=5.5), residence in a high-incidence geographic location (OR=10.0), and clinical features such as back pain (OR = 9.4), together with low haemoglobin and elevated AST levels, were independent predictors of blood culture positivity in brucellosis. Interpretation & conclusions It may be possible to predict bacteraemia in brucellosis by using a combination of epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory criteria."
41517447,Cetirizine and Dexamethasone in Sepsis: Insights into Maresin-1 Signaling and Cytokine Regulation.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality, yet its etiopathogenesis is still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cetirizine and dexamethasone (alone and in combination) on serum levels of Maresin-1 (MaR-1), TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in a rat model of sepsis induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8-10 weeks were used and randomly divided into 7 groups, each containing 7 rats: Group 1 (Control), Group 2 (Sham), Group 3 (Sepsis), Group 4 (Sepsis + Saline), Group 5 (Sepsis + Cetirizine), Group 6 (Sepsis + Dexamethasone), and Group 7 (Sepsis + Cetirizine + Dexamethasone). Sepsis was induced via CLP in all groups except Control and Sham. Results: In the sepsis groups (G3-G7), neutrophil and white blood cell counts increased while lymphocyte counts decreased (p < 0.05). In groups treated with cetirizine and/or dexamethasone (G5-G7), a significant decrease in neutrophils and an increase in lymphocytes were observed. MaR-1 levels significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in all sepsis-induced groups compared to controls, while interleukin levels significantly increased. Cetirizine and dexamethasone supplementation significantly increased MaR-1 levels and decreased interleukin levels (p < 0.05). The combined treatment was more effective. Conclusions: This study is the first to highlight the potential of MaR-1 as a critical biomarker in sepsis diagnosis and monitoring, and cetirizine and dexamethasone, especially in combination, may represent a promising therapeutic option in sepsis management."
41517265,Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Steven-Johnson Syndrome During the Postpartum Period: A Literature Review with a Rare Case Presentation.,2025,"Introduction: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are rare yet dangerous dermatological emergencies presenting as necrosis of the skin and mucous membranes due to an immune reaction which may be associated with the use of pharmaceuticals-predominantly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, and antiretroviral drugs. During the postpartum period, women are administered numerous pharmaceuticals, including NSAIDs, analgesics, and antibiotics, due to pain and their susceptibility to infections, exposing them to potential adverse effects including allergies and immune reactions. Case Report and Review: The case reported here is a rare description of a patient in the early postpartum phase who presented with epidermal necrolysis whilst remaining hospitalized after a cesarean delivery. The multidisciplinary approach, early diagnosis, and treatment ensured the patient's full recovery. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment resulted in a rapid therapeutic effect. This literature review offers an insight into the epidemiology, diagnostic process, and treatment of this infrequent dermatological syndrome during the postpartum period. Results: Antibiotic treatment is a common culprit of TEN in this population; hence, clinicians should remain vigilant during antibiotic administration. Differential diagnosis with toxic shock syndrome is crucial, as TEN and SJS symptoms may mimic sepsis, which is a more common diagnosis in the postpartum period. Conclusions: The condition of the skin during the postpartum period should be closely monitored, as some systemic diseases may manifest abruptly as profound, postpartum hormonal changes affect the immunological response. Upon the discovery of suspicious skin lesions concomitant with systemic symptoms, an immediate multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians and dermatologists is key to a rapid diagnosis and treatment to avoid maternal mortality."
41517263,"Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: IL-6 Dynamics, Inflammatory Phenotypes, and Short-Term Organ-Failure Trajectories in a Real-World Cohort.",2025,"Background and Objectives: In severe COVID-19-associated sepsis, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is used as a rescue strategy to modulate cytokine and coagulation derangements, but its biomarker and organ-failure effects remain incompletely characterised. We evaluated peri-procedural changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), other inflammatory markers, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores according to TPE intensity, timing, and inflammatory phenotypes. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study including 102 mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-associated sepsis who received >/=1 TPE session. Patients were grouped by number of sessions (1, 2, >/=3), timing (</=14 vs. >14 days from symptom onset), IL-6 responder status (>/=50% reduction), and two unsupervised inflammatory-thrombotic clusters. Peri-procedural changes (Delta) in biomarkers and SOFA were compared using non-parametric tests, with multivariable logistic and linear regression exploring predictors of IL-6 response and DeltaSOFA. Results: Baseline severity was similar across TPE-intensity groups, with median APACHE II scores of 11-12 and SOFA scores around 7 in all strata. Median IL-6 concentrations declined after TPE in each group (e.g., Delta -59.4 pg/mL after 1 session and Delta -65.1 pg/mL after >/=3 sessions), but between-group differences in DeltaIL-6 were not statistically significant (p = 0.276). By contrast, D-dimer exhibited a marked decline only in the 1-session group (median Delta -1.7 mg/L vs. ~0.0 mg/L in the 2- and >/=3-session groups; p < 0.001). Timing (early vs. late TPE) did not materially affect DeltaIL-6, DeltaCRP, DeltaSOFA (median 0.0 in both), or DeltaD-dimer. Overall, 50% of patients were IL-6 responders; baseline IL-6 was the only independent predictor (adjusted OR 1.9 per doubling, 95% CI 1.3-2.8). A hyperinflammatory-thrombotic cluster (n = 44) exhibited higher baseline IL-6 (612.3 vs. 92.4 pg/mL), more >/=3-session TPE (65.9% vs. 29.3%), and higher IL-6 responder rates (75.0% vs. 31.0%), but similar 28-day mortality (40.9% vs. 29.3%). Conclusions: In this real-world TPE programme, biochemical improvements-particularly IL-6 and D-dimer reductions in hyperinflammatory-thrombotic patients-were not consistently accompanied by short-term SOFA or survival benefits, underscoring the need for phenotype-guided and trial-based use."
41515590,Exploring the Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum Mid-Regional Pro-Adrenomedullin in Tick-Borne Encephalitis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"Background: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide with vasoregulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its stable fragment, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), is a validated biomarker in sepsis and systemic infections, but its role in viral neuroinfections remains unexplored. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), is a major viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with long-term neurological sequelae. This study aimed to assess MR-proADM levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with TBE and to evaluate their diagnostic utility and pathophysiological significance. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 20 patients with confirmed TBE and 14 non-infectious neurological controls. MR-proADM concentrations were measured in paired CSF and serum samples using an ELISA assay. Statistical analyses included group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test), correlation analyses (Spearman's r), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation. Results: Serum MR-proADM levels at baseline (SER1) were significantly lower in TBE patients compared with controls (p = 0.0197). The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio differed significantly between groups (p = 0.0063) and showed the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.816, 95% CI 0.63-0.93; sensitivity 79%, specificity 80%). MR-proADM concentrations in CSF correlated with total CSF protein (r = 0.53), suggesting an association with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Strong reproducibility was observed for serum MR-proADM between sampling points (r = 0.83). Conclusions: MR-proADM levels in CSF and serum are altered in patients with TBE, indicating its potential as a biomarker of CNS infection and inflammation. The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio may serve as a sensitive indicator of blood-CSF barrier involvement, while decreased serum levels may reflect impaired systemic neuroprotective response. These findings highlight a possible role of ADM in neuroimmune regulation during viral encephalitis and warrant validation in larger prospective studies."
41510275,Metagenomic Cell-free DNA Sequencing for Treatment Monitoring in Sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. Early identification of pathogens and accurate assessment of organ injury are critical for improving outcomes, but current methods are often inadequate, especially after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Metagenomic sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) offers a promising alternative, enabling simultaneous pathogen detection and tissue-of-origin profiling. Contamination, however, can limit its accuracy in low-biomass samples. Here, we apply the Sample-Intrinsic Microbial DNA Found by Tagging and Sequencing (SIFT-seq) assay, which reduces contamination and allows detection of pathogens and organ injury simultaneously. We analyzed 142 plasma specimens: 105 from sepsis patients, 103 collected after initiation of antibiotic treatment, 24 from non-sepsis ICU controls, and 13 from healthy controls. SIFT-seq identified sepsis-causing pathogens in good agreement with pre-antibiotic blood cultures, revealed elevated immune activity and organ injury in sepsis patients, and, when combined with the SOFA score in a multivariate model, improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.874). These findings highlight the potential of integrated cfDNA profiling to enhance sepsis diagnosis."

41509090,Infection rates of trans-perineal versus trans-rectal prostate biopsy: A Middle Eastern tertiary center experience-Time for a change?,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in men, with transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy being the most frequently used method of tissue diagnosis in the past. With the introduction of the new modality of trans-perineal (TP) ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, urologists and radiologists adopted this new technique for the decreased rate of complications such as urinary tract infections, bacteremia, sepsis and the avoidance of antimicrobial prophylaxis. We aim to compare the infectious rates of TRUS versus TP biopsy from our Middle Eastern tertiary care center. METHODS: Retrospective data was collected on patients from our medical records from May 2019 till December 2023 at our institution. The data included adult male patients aged 18 years and above undergoing TP or TRUS prostate biopsy. Patients with positive urine culture before biopsy were excluded. Electronic medical records, pathology and laboratory reports were reviewed to collect patient-related data including age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, medical history and comorbidities. In addition, variables related to the procedure type, the target lesion location, antibiotic prophylaxis, bowl preparation, number of cores taken, and laterality of the tumor were included. RESULTS: A total of 745 patients underwent an ultrasound guided prostate biopsy performed by 6 attending urologists at our institution. Among them, 157 (21.1%) patients underwent TRUS biopsy, while 588 (78.9%) underwent TP biopsy. Within one month of the biopsy, 13 patients (1.7%) developed UTI. 6 of them had TRUS (4.1%), and 7 had TP (1.2%) with p = 0.03. Four patients required hospital admission for fever and bacteremia, all of which had undergone TRUS biopsy with hospital stay from 2-5 days receiving meropenem, ciprofloxacin, cefixime or Bactrim. CONCLUSION: TP prostate biopsy carries a lower risk of infectious complications and requires no antibiotic prophylaxis compared to TRUS biopsy of the prostate. These results advocate the superiority of the use of TP biopsy over TRUS biopsy."
41504355,Intraoperative Anaphylaxis in the Setting of Undiagnosed Alpha-Gal Syndrome: A Heart Team Clinical Conundrum.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a delayed allergic reaction to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, a carbohydrate in nonprimate mammalian tissue. Reactions can occur in individuals exposed to lone star ticks after consuming red meat and dairy products and/or exposure to mammal-derived medications or bioprosthetic materials. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old man undergoing valve and ascending aortic replacement experienced hemodynamic collapse after transfusion of heparin, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. Transfusion reaction, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis were ruled out. Recovery occurred within 6 hours of medical treatment. After an otherwise uncomplicated hospitalization, he was diagnosed with AGS and treated with diet restriction and omalizumab. DISCUSSION AND TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: In addition to anaphylaxis, AGS may also have long-term cardiovascular effects such as early bioprosthetic valve failure, accelerated atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. Understanding of clinical subtleties of AGS and its cardiovascular implications is important for clinicians who manage these patients both in the short and long terms."
41504062,METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Ferroptosis in Sepsis-Associated Acute Lung Injury - A Narrative Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) represents a complex and life-threatening condition with limited therapeutic options. Recent research has unveiled the role of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in exacerbating ferroptosis via m6A-insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets. This study delves into the implications, challenges, and prospects of this intricate molecular pathway in sepsis-associated ALI. METTL3-mediated M6A modifications assume a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. These modifications exacerbate ferroptosis, a regulated cell death process characterized by iron-dependent oxidative damage to lipids. The involvement of m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming adds another layer of complexity to this mechanism, offering potential therapeutic avenues. Understanding the intricate network of METTL3-mediated m6A modifications, IGF2BP2, and mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming poses a formidable challenge. Developing interventions that modulate this pathway while minimizing off-target effects remains a significant hurdle. Patient-specific responses and identifying reliable biomarkers further complicate the clinical translation of these findings. The unraveling of this molecular pathway holds promise for personalized medicine approaches in ALI management. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions based on individual patient profiles may significantly enhance clinical outcomes. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including researchers, clinicians, and drug developers, is essential to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and clinical applications."
41503625,[Revision Arthroplasty for Periprosthetic Femoral Fracture Complicated by Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli: Case Report and Minireview].,2025,"Periprosthetic infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria are one of the most fearsome complications in current orthopedics. Despite using aseptic modern practices, the number of infectious complications caused by multidrug-resistant strains is rising worldwide. We present a case of a woman with a non-healing wound after hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed in Egypt for periprosthetic femoral fracture. Upon admission, 11 days after surgery, she presented with a purulent secretion from surgical wound and signs of sepsis. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli was proven from a wound swab. Two-stage revision with a 6-week-long interval of targeted parenteral antibiotic therapy was indicated. During explantation, excessive femoral bone loss after inadequately performed trauma revision surgery was discovered. After antibiotic hip spacer period, the patient underwent implantation of a cemented tumorous revision hip implant followed by 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged in more than satisfactory condition, being self-sufficient using French crutches. In follow-up visits during next 2 years, no relapse of carbapenem-resistant infection occurred. In patients hospitalized or operated in high-risk areas, epidemiological anamnesis is of great importance and the possibility of importing multi-resistant bacteria should be considered. Infections caused by these bacteria prolong therapy and increase the cost of treatment significantly. The combination of arthroplasty extraction and targeted antibiotic therapy is recommended to treat periprosthetic infections."
41503298,Septic Myocarditis Masquerading as Acute Inferior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,2025,"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a rare and alarming presentation in adolescents, particularly in women. We report the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with classic symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, including severe retrosternal chest pain, ST-segment elevations on ECG, and a significantly elevated troponin I level (18 ng/mL). The ECG showed evidence of ST elevation in inferior leads, suggestive of inferior STEMI. Urgent coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, effectively ruling out coronary occlusion. The diagnostic pivot was guided by concomitant fever, hypotension, profound leukocytosis (40,900/microL), and a markedly elevated procalcitonin level (11.1 ng/mL). Blood cultures were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe global left ventricular dysfunction (35%). Despite negative blood cultures, a diagnosis of septic shock with secondary septic myocarditis was made based on the overwhelming clinical and biomarker evidence. Initiation of antibiotic therapy led to rapid clinical improvement within 72 hours, accompanied by complete resolution of ST-segment elevations. This case underscores septic myocarditis as a critical mimic of STEMI and highlights the importance of a normal angiogram in redirecting management toward life-threatening infectious etiologies."
41503120,Case Report: A Painful Twist of Fate Due to Intra-abdominal Textiloma.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. CONCLUSION: Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes."
41503117,Perforated Meckel's diverticulum: A rare evolution from diverticulitis to sepsis.,2026,"Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract and affects  approximately 2% of the population. Although usually asymptomatic, MD may lead to complications including diverticulitis, bleeding, obstruction, and-rarely-perforation. Because perforated MD often mimics acute appendicitis, diagnosis before surgery is frequently missed. We describe a 58-year-old man who presented with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and nausea. Ultrasound excluded appendicitis and raised suspicion for MD. Contrast-enhanced CT confirmed an inflamed 3.5-cm MD with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute diverticulitis. The patient initially improved with conservative therapy but returned five days later with worsening pain and fever. A second CT revealed microperforation with peridiverticular extraluminal gas and fluid. Within 48 hours, clinical sepsis developed. A third CT demonstrated frank pneumoperitoneum and diffuse peritoneal free fluid. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed a perforated MD, which was resected, followed by ileostomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Although rare, MD perforation is potentially life-threatening. This case uniquely illustrates the radiologic evolution from diverticulitis to microperforation and ultimately free perforation, documented across three consecutive CT examinations. Awareness of this progression may improve early recognition and timely surgical management of complicated MD."
41502881,Herpes simplex virus 2-associated symmetrical peripheral gangrene in an immunocompetent fourteen-year-old girl: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is a rare but devastating clinical syndrome marked by symmetrical distal ischemic damage in the absence of large vessel obstruction or vasculitis, usually resulting in high mortality and frequent limb amputations among survivors. The underlying causes are multifactorial, including both infectious and noninfectious factors. However, neither the implicated etiological factors nor the precise mechanisms of pathogenesis have been fully elucidated, making diagnosis and management particularly challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: This report describes a 14-year-old girl who initially exhibited fever, edematous extremities, widespread erythema and small blisters on the trunk and extremities, and subsequent blackening of the fingers and toes. Her condition rapidly progressed to sepsis, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and early hemophagocytic syndrome, culminating in a diagnosis of SPG. Comprehensive etiological investigations revealed herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection as the underlying cause. Through prompt multidisciplinary interventions-including mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, antiviral therapy, anticoagulation, plasma exchange, immunosuppression, and meticulous wound care-the patient achieved a remarkable recovery, with only minor residual pigmentation on her extremities. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights HSV-2 as a rare but potential cause of SPG, broadening the spectrum of known pathogens. Early recognition, rapid diagnostic work-up, and timely multidisciplinary management are essential to improve outcomes and prevent limb loss."
41502864,Blood culture practices and microbiological capacity for sepsis diagnostics in Europe (2021-2022): a cross-sectional analysis of the European Sepsis Care Survey.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Blood cultures (BCs) are key diagnostic elements for sepsis patients. Accurate preanalytical procedures are substantial, and results should be available as soon as possible to guide adequate antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to evaluate BC collection practices and diagnostic capacity across European hospitals. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey investigated BC diagnostics in acute care hospitals across 37 European countries in the years 2021 and 2022. Analyses included BC guidelines, collection sites, number of BC sets in emergency departments (EDs), wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). We also examined transfer after collection, the use of on-site vs. external laboratories, opening hours, rapid testing capacity, and turn-around times of BCs processed in microbiology laboratories with different infrastructures. FINDINGS: Responses were collected from 907 hospitals in Europe. BC guidelines were available in 84.4% (741/878) of the hospitals. BCs were preferably collected by multiple-site sampling in EDs (62.7%, 461/735), in wards (64.0%, 513/802) and ICUs (68.5%, 518/756). One BC set was preferred in EDs in 38.4% (270/704), in wards in 40.5% (314/775), and ICUs in 34.9% (261/748). Two BC sets were preferred in EDs in 31.0% (218/704), in wards in 28.1% (218/775), and ICUs in 39.2% (293/748). 48.0% (402/838) of hospitals used on-site and 52.0% (436/838) external microbiology laboratories. Around-the-clock microbiological services were available in 10⋅0% (91/907), and rapid pathogen identification in 43.7% (396/907) of hospitals. Infrastructure with around-the-clock microbiological service and rapid testing was available in 7.4% (62/840) of hospitals, and probability of a final microbiological result within two days was highest in these hospitals compared to hospitals with limited microbiology service (for BC collected on wards: 19.6% vs. 52.7%, Odds Ratio 4.59 [95% CI 2.50-7.79], p < 0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Despite the availability of BC guidelines in many hospitals, current recommendations for BC collection were often neglected. Rapid testing capacity was limited in most microbiological laboratories, and around-the-clock service for BCs was very rare. As delay in results may have a detrimental impact on patient outcomes, strategies to improve these processes are urgently needed.

41500684,[Development and evaluation of a risk prediction model for sepsis-associated liver injury in the intensive care unit].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate independent risk factors for sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis, establish an effective risk prediction model, and validate it. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using patients diagnosed with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC- IV) v2.2 database. Patients were divided into SALI and non-SALI groups based on the occurrence of SALI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, infection sites, vital signs upon ICU admission, initial laboratory parameters within 24 hours of ICU admission, treatment interventions, 24-hour urine output, disease severity scores, and prognostic indicators collected and compared between the two groups. The entire cohort was divided into training and validation sets using a 7 : 3 random sampling ratio. Independent risk factors for SALI occurrence were identified in the training set using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Based on this, a risk prediction model was constructed and presented as a nomogram. Model performance was evaluated in both training and validation sets. Predictive capability was assessed using receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), model calibration was determined via calibration curves, and net benefit was evaluated through decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The final cohort included 8 549 sepsis patients, comprising 1 067 in the SALI group and 7 482 in the non-SALI group. Significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding gender, type of ICU admission, hypertension, organ failure status, site of infection (bloodstream infection, pulmonary infection, abdominal infection), vital signs, and laboratory tests [white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count (PLT), albumin (Alb), total bilirubin (Tbil), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum calcium, serum potassium, serum sodium, bicarbonate, anion gap (AG), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), pH, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), lactate], therapeutic interventions [use of albumin, norepinephrine, vasopressin, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mechanical ventilation, central venous catheterization], 24-hour urine output after ICU admission, disease severity scores, and prognostic indicators were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). After regression analysis screening of these factors in the training set, eight indicators were ultimately included in the predictive model: intra-abdominal infection [odds ratio (OR) = 4.046, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 3.236-5.059, P < 0.001], vasopressin (OR = 2.188, 95%CI was 1.778-2.694, P < 0.001), CRRT (OR = 1.928, 95%CI was 1.506-2.469, P < 0.001), RDW (OR = 1.109, 95%CI was 1.069-1.151, P < 0.001), PLT (OR = 0.996, 95%CI was 0.995-0.997, P < 0.001), PT (OR = 1.042, 95%CI was 1.034-1.051, P < 0.001), lactate (OR = 1.154, 95%CI was 1.107-1.202, P < 0.001), and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA; OR = 1.119, 95%CI was 1.089-1.150, P < 0.001). ROC curves demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.830 (95%CI was 0.814-0.847) for the training set and 0.847 (95%CI was 0.825-0.869) for the validation set. Calibration curves demonstrated good agreement with the ideal curve in both the training and validation sets. DCA curve indicated that the model could effectively distinguish between patients with and without disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal infection, vasopressin, CRRT, RDW, PLT, PT, lactate, and SOFA score are independent risk factors for SALI in patients with sepsis. The SALI prediction model constructed based on these factors demonstrates certain clinical predictive value."
41500683,[Lactate trajectory-based phenotypes and their association with 28-day mortality in septic cardiomyopathy: a multicenter retrospective cohort study].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate phenotypic classification based on plasma lactate trajectories and its association with 28-day mortality in patients with septic cardiomyopathy (SCM). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with SCM admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three tertiary hospitals (Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, and GuiQian International Hospital) from October 2019 to December 2024 were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, intervention strategies, and clinical outcomes were collected, including the first blood lactate level upon ICU admission and daily lactate values within 7 days after SCM diagnosis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included 28-day vasoactive drug-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. Latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to identify lactate trajectory-based phenotypes. Differences in the above indicators among phenotypes were compared, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in SCM patients. RESULTS: A total of 216 SCM patients were included, among whom 41 died and 175 survived within 28 days. LCGM identified four lactate trajectory phenotypes: phenotype 1 (persistent low level, n = 142), phenotype 2 (moderate level with rapid decline, n = 32), phenotype 3 (moderate level with slow increase, n = 20), and phenotype 4 (high level with slow decline, n = 22). The 28-day mortality rates of patients in phenotypes 1-4 showed a significant increasing trend (9.2%, 21.9%, 30.0%, and 68.2%, respectively, P < 0.05). Phenotype 1, which exhibited the lowest mortality and lowest acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE), was designated as the baseline group. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that phenotypes 3 and 4 were associated with 28-day mortality in SCM patients (both P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that phenotype 3 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.831, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.243-6.447] and phenotype 4 (HR = 2.389, 95%CI was 1.223-4.663) were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality (both P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the survival probability gradually flattened after 3 weeks of hospitalization. Using phenotype 1 as the baseline, patients with phenotypes 3 and 4 had a higher risk of death, and the risk in phenotype 4 was significantly higher than that in phenotype 3 (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the four patient groups were stratified into high-risk (high level with slow decline), intermediate-risk (moderate level with slow increase), and low-risk (moderate level with rapid decline and persistent low level) categories. CONCLUSIONS: Four phenotypes of SCM were successfully identified based on lactate trajectories, which were closely associated with 28-day mortality and could be used for risk stratification, providing new insights for prognosis assessment and individualized treatment of SCM."
25299040,Barth Syndrome.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Barth syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized in affected males by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and prepubertal growth delay; however, not all features may be present in an affected male. Cardiomyopathy, which is almost always present before age five years, is typically dilated cardiomyopathy with or without endocardial fibroelastosis or left ventricular noncompaction; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also occur. Heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; risk of arrhythmia and sudden death is increased. Neutropenia is most often associated with bacterial infections and aphthous ulcers, pneumonia, and sepsis. Skeletal myopathy predominantly affects the proximal muscles, and results in delays in development of early motor skills. Prepubertal growth delay is followed by a postpubertal growth spurt with remarkable ""catch-up"" growth. Heterozygous females who have a normal karyotype are asymptomatic and have normal biochemical studies. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Barth syndrome is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and either an increased monolysocardiolipin-to-cardiolipin ratio (if available) or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in TAFAZZIN (formerly TAZ) identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of Barth syndrome is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Elamipretide is indicated for the improvement of muscle strength in individuals with Barth syndrome. Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of cardiac issues include: (1) for cardiac arrhythmia, consideration of antiarrhythmic medications or implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD); (2) for heart failure, careful fluid and volume management and avoidance of overdiuresis and dehydration, standard heart failure medications, and cardiac transplantation when heart failure is severe and intractable. Interventions for other findings include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for neutropenia; physical therapy for skeletal muscle weakness; standard treatment for talipes equinovarus and/or scoliosis; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement for persistent feeding issues; uncooked cornstarch prior to bedtime for hypoglycemia; standard management of developmental delay / intellectual disability. Prevention of secondary complications: Aspirin therapy to prevent clot formation in those with severe cardiac dysfunction and/or marked left ventricular noncompaction; antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent infections; limit fasting or provide intravenous glucose infusion prior to planned medical procedures; regularly monitor blood potassium concentrations during administration of IV fluids that contain potassium and during episodes of diarrhea; consult with nutritionist and/or gastroenterologist to determine optimal caloric delivery. Surveillance: Monitoring existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations requires at least annual electrocardiography with Holter monitor and echocardiography; as-needed electrophysiologic studies to assess for potentially serious cardiac arrhythmia; at least semiannual complete blood count with differential as well as with all febrile episodes; at each visit, measurement of height and weight, clinical assessment of strength, and clinical assessment for scoliosis; every three to five years during childhood, formal assessments of developmental progress and educational needs. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting, use of rectal thermometers in those with neutropenia, and use of succinylcholine. Although growth hormone is typically not indicated as most affected males will attain normal stature by adulthood, recommendations about use of human growth hormone may vary based on endocrinology testing and recommendations. The muscular involvement in Barth syndrome may increase the risk for malignant hyperthermia compared to the general population. Evaluations of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing (if the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant in the family is known) or monolysocardiolipin-to-cardiolipin ratio testing (if the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant in the family is not known) of male sibs of a proband and male relatives in the maternal lineage is appropriate to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. GENETIC COUNSELING: Barth syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes. Heterozygous females typically do not manifest the disease. Affected males transmit the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. If the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, identification of female heterozygotes and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing for Barth syndrome are possible."
41497531,LncRNA PCED1B-AS1 Inhibits Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury by Promoting Transformation of Macrophages from M1 to M2 Type via Regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 Axis.,2025,"PURPOSE: A common complication observed in septic patients under intensive care is acute kidney injury (AKI), which is characterized by acute onset and strong inflammation, resulting in poor clinical outcomes for patients. This study aims to explore the expression status of PCED1B-AS1 in sepsis-induced AKI and to preliminarily investigate the molecular mechanism by which PCED1B-AS1 affects AKI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 105 healthy individuals and 220 patients with sepsis (110 patients with AKI and 110 non-AKI patients). The levels of PCED1B-AS1 were examined by RT-qPCR. Macrophage polarization was induced by LPS treatment of RAW264.7 cells, and an in vitro renal injury model was established using HK-2 cells. Cell proliferation ability was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the levels of inflammatory factors were assessed using ELISA kits. The dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the interrelationship among the PCED1B-AS1/miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis. RESULTS: PCED1B-AS1 was downregulated in sepsis patients without AKI and further reduced in AKI patients. PCED1B-AS1 could differentiate healthy individuals from non-AKI sepsis patients and identify AKI patients. Additionally, low PCED1B-AS1 expression correlated with poor AKI prognosis. Overexpression of PCED1B-AS1 promoted the polarization of M1 macrophages to M2 by regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and inflammatory responses in HK-2 cells. CONCLUSION: PCED1B-AS1 may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker and inhibit sepsis-induced AKI by promoting transformation of macrophages from M1 to M2 type via regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis."
41497501,Subphenotyping sepsis based on organ interaction trajectory using a deep temporal graph clustering model: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome with varying degrees of multi-organ dysfunction. Identifying dynamic inter-organ interactions is critical for accurate sepsis subphenotyping and targeted therapy, yet remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to quantify the dynamic trajectories of organ interactions to define sepsis phenotypes, supporting personalized treatment and clinical decision-making. METHODS: We proposed a novel deep temporal graph clustering model to identify sepsis phenotypes by quantifying dynamic multi-organ interactions within 48 h post-diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset (admissions from 2001 to 2012) and externally validated on the eICU Collaborative Research (eICU) dataset (admissions from 2014 to 2015). Its effectiveness was benchmarked against state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Patient characteristics, multi-organ system states coupling patterns, and prognostic outcomes were compared across the identified phenotypes. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used for early phenotype classification at 4 h post-diagnosis. To enhance clinical applicability, a user-friendly web interface was developed. Propensity score matching and weighted logistic regression were employed to evaluate the effects of the fluid management strategies on in-hospital mortality of patients with various phenotypes. FINDINGS: A total of 10,181 and 6208 unique sepsis patients were employed as the cohorts for the model development and external validation, respectively. Three distinct phenotypes were identified and labeled as Phenotype A, B, and C, exhibiting significant differences in baseline characteristics, organ system states coupling patterns, and outcomes (P-value < 0.05). Phenotype A had the lowest mortality (5.59%) and accounted for the largest proportion of patients (46.34%). In contrast, Phenotype C represented the highest mortality (38.27%) and comprised the smallest proportion (22.78%). Phenotype A was characterized by sustained synchronous improvement across organ system states. Phenotype B showed persistent decoupling of organ system states. Phenotype C exhibited a rapid transition from early asynchrony to synchronization. The model demonstrated robust clustering performance in external validation. The simplified classifier showed high predictive performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84 (95% CI [0.83, 0.86]) for phenotype prediction at 4 h post-diagnosis. The beneficial fluid management strategies varied across different phenotypes, highlighting the need for targeted fluid intervals. INTERPRETATION: This study characterizes sepsis phenotypes using organ interaction trajectories and identifies three heterogeneous patterns of disease progression. These patterns offer new insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sepsis, which can support the design of clinical trials on disease progression and guide the optimal allocation of intensive care resources.

41497389,Vasoactive drug use in children with community acquired septic shock in Australia and New Zealand.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Vasoactive agents are a critical supportive therapy for children with sepsis. We describe the choice and use patterns of vasoactive agents in children with sepsis. METHODS: Prospective observational study conducted in 11 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand through the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) Network from April 2021 to December 2023. Children aged 0-<18 years with suspected sepsis were included. Children admitted to hospital and treated with parenteral antibiotics and either 1) a provisional diagnosis of sepsis, and/or 2) treatment for suspected sepsis (fluid bolus to treat poor perfusion). The frequency and sequence of use of vasoactive agents, and contributors to the choice of initial vasoactive were collected. FINDINGS: 6232 children with suspected sepsis were included; median age of 2.1 years (IQR 0.3-7.1 years), in-hospital mortality of 60 (1.0%), in whom a subset of 306 (4.9%) met Phoenix sepsis criteria. Vasoactive agents were used in 179 (2.9%) children overall and in 144 (45.8%) of those meeting Phoenix sepsis criteria. The most used first, second, and third-line vasoactive agents were adrenaline (90/179; 50.3%), noradrenaline (49/91; 53.8%), and vasopressin (16/40; 40.0%). When comparing noradrenaline vs adrenaline as first line agents, increasing age was associated with preferential use of noradrenaline (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09; p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Children with suspected community acquired sepsis rarely received treatment with vasoactive agents. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were the most used agents, though there was substantial variation in their use and sequencing. FUNDING: This study is funded in part by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Medical Research Future Fund grant (GNT1190814).

41497347,Copper-Induced Cell Death in Renal Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.,2025,"Copper dyshomeostasis and the resulting induction of cuproptosis, a novel regulated cell death pathway driven by mitochondrial copper overload, play a critical role in renal pathophysiology. Cuproptosis is characterized by FDX1-mediated copper reduction, irreversible aggregation of lipoylated TCA cycle enzymes, such as dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, and destabilization of iron‒sulfur cluster proteins, leading to proteotoxic mitochondrial collapse. The kidney's high vulnerability arises from its filtration and metabolic functions. This review consolidates evidence linking cuproptosis to various renal disorders, including acute kidney injury (eg, sepsis-induced, cisplatin-induced, and ischemia-reperfusion injury), diabetic nephropathy through mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation, and chronic kidney disease involving podocyte damage or context-dependent dysregulation in fibrosis and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Notably, cuproptosis and ferroptosis interact synergistically through shared mechanisms, where glutathione depletion or iron overload exacerbates both pathways, while mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation create a self-perpetuating injury cycle. Emerging diagnostic strategies utilize cuproptosis-related biomarkers for early detection, supported by various prediction models. In therapeutic contexts, copper chelators, transporter modulators, and dual-pathway inhibitors targeting both cuproptosis and ferroptosis mitigate renal damage in preclinical models. Dietary interventions that modulate copper bioavailability also hold promise. However, challenges remain, including identifying renal cell type-specific mechanisms, developing noninvasive biomarkers, optimizing kidney-targeted nanotherapeutics, and preventing iatrogenic copper deficiency. Future research may focus on translational applications and the physiological roles of cuproptosis in renal repair. Targeting cuproptosis offers a promising avenue for innovative diagnostics and treatments in nephrology."
41497125,Higher admission IL-6 levels are associated with higher platelet levels at discharge in sepsis patients.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome, with an overall mortality rate of 32.8%. Platelets have been shown to have a central role in the pathogenesis of a diverse array of immune-mediated and infectious diseases, and both thrombocytopenia and platelet hyperreactivity independently correlate with elevated sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: From February 2021 to June 2022, patients diagnosed with sepsis (according to the Sepsis 3.0 criteria) from the emergency department were screened and enrolled in a prospective observational cytokine analysis cohort. ""Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Grp I Panel 17-plex"" was used for cytokines analysis. Patients were stratified into high- and low-platelet groups using a discharge platelet threshold of 150 x 10(9)/L. Data were analyzed with R 4.4.0 and GraphPad Prism 9, calculating medians and frequencies for variables. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled and were classified into high- and low-platelet groups (31 vs 26). IL-6 had a significant difference between the two groups after adjusting for admission platelet level and length of stay in hospital (2072 vs 107.1, q < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve also showed IL-6 had high degrees of sensitivity and specificity for predicting higher platelet levels. CONCLUSION: Higher IL-6 levels at admission for sepsis were associated with higher platelet levels at discharge."
41497096,A silent journey from kidney to lungs: pyelonephritis triggering septic pulmonary embolism - a rare case report from Nepal.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by infected thrombi from extrapulmonary sites lodging in pulmonary arteries, resulting in infarction and infection. Its nonspecific presentation, including fever, cough, and chest pain, often delays diagnosis. Predisposing factors include infective endocarditis, intravascular catheters, oropharyngeal infections, and urinary tract infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old female with hypertension and diabetes mellitus arrived with fever, active cough, sudden shortness of breath, and pain in her left flank. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral lung nodules with cavitation, wedge-shaped opacities, and feeding vessel indications, all of which were suggestive of SPE. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein. Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in both urine and sputum cultures. The patient was given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and ICU care, which included mechanical ventilation. The antibiotic medication was adjusted based on culture sensitivity, resulting in gradual clinical improvement. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: SPE diagnosis is difficult due to vague symptoms, but can be supported by CT findings such as peripheral nodules, cavitation, wedge-shaped lesions, and feeding vessel indications. Early identification of the major illness source and the use of targeted broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial. Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, cancer, necrotizing pneumonia, and fungal diseases; fast cavitation and peripheral spread favor SPE. CONCLUSION: SPE should be suspected in patients with extrapulmonary infections presenting with pulmonary nodules or cavitation, particularly when CT shows feeding vessel signs. Prompt diagnosis, removal of infectious sources, and early, appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to improve patient outcomes."
41497078,Racial and ethnic disparities in utilization of mechanical circulatory support for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective cross-sectional study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is critical in the management of cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but racial/ethnic disparities in MCS utilization remain understudied. METHODS: We extracted data from the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2018 to 2020. Patients aged >/=18 years with AMI and CS listed as primary or secondary diagnosis were identified using ICD-10-CM. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included MCS utilization, hospital length of stay (LOS), total hospital charges, acute kidney injury (AKI)/hemodialysis, and sepsis. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess associations between race/ethnicity and in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Among 89 125 hospitalizations for AMI and CS, Hispanics had lower in-hospital mortality than Whites (OR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96). The MCS use was higher among Asians or Pacific Islanders (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.60) and Hispanics (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30) than among Whites. Hispanics had longer LOS (beta = 1.3 days; 95% CI, 0.78-1.7), whereas Blacks had shorter stays (beta = -0.50 days; 95% CI,-0.91 to -0.10) than Whites. The rates of AKI/hemodialysis were higher among Hispanics (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12-1.42), Blacks (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.40-1.79), and Asians or Pacific Islanders (OR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.18-1.64) than Whites. Sepsis rate was greater among Hispanics (OR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.34). Total hospital charges were higher among Hispanics ($53 770; 95% CI, $39 307-$68 233) and Asians or Pacific Islanders ($33 737; 95% CI, $8954-$58 520), than Whites. CONCLUSION: Racial and ethnic disparities in MCS use and clinical outcomes persist among patients with AMI and CS."
41497039,Implantable biosensors for continuous sepsis detection in postoperative care.,2026,"Implantable biosensors are emerging as transformative tools for real-time sepsis surveillance in postoperative patients. By continuously monitoring key inflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines and endotoxins, these systems can enable earlier diagnosis and intervention than traditional intermittent testing. Technological advances such as active-reset DNA-aptamer biosensors for cytokine tracking and electrochemical lipopolysaccharide sensors achieving attogram-level sensitivity illustrate rapid progress in the field. Research across the United States, Europe, and Asia highlights the growing global commitment to integrating biosensors into perioperative monitoring. Their application across surgical specialties may fundamentally shift postoperative care from reactive to predictive management, reducing sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Ongoing research into wireless communication, long-term biocompatibility, and multiplexed sensing will be pivotal to clinical translation and adoption in both high- and low-resource healthcare systems."
41494198,Plasma apolipoprotein E levels and sepsis risk based on multi-center cohorts and multi-omics validation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care, with limited reliable biomarkers that reflect upstream pathophysiology and enable early risk stratification. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter with immune-regulatory functions, has shown inconsistent associations with sepsis outcomes. Its causal and clinically actionable role in sepsis risk requires clarification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a multi-layered strategy integrating Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and phenome-wide association studies across five large proteogenomic cohorts (>500,000 individuals) to identify plasma proteins causally linked to sepsis. ApoE emerged as a top candidate and was validated in a clinical cohort of 291 ICU patients and in murine sepsis models. We assessed the relationship between ApoE levels and sepsis risk using logistic regression, restricted cubic spline models, and survival analyses, and explored underlying mechanisms via cytokine profiling, histopathology, and transcriptomics. RESULTS: ApoE was causally associated with sepsis risk in multiple independent datasets, supported by strong genetic colocalization (posterior probability for shared causal variant PP.H4 > 0.80). In ICU patients, both low (adjusted OR 12.74, 95% CI 5.72-28.36) and high ApoE levels (adjusted OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.25-9.16) were independently associated with increased sepsis risk compared to medium levels, forming a significant U-shaped pattern (P_nonlinear < 0.001). This biphasic risk was mirrored in murine models, where both hypo- and hyper-expression of ApoE aggravated systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality. LDL cholesterol mediated only ~ 20% of the ApoE-sepsis association, indicating lipid-independent mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Plasma ApoE functions as a biphasic, dose-sensitive modulator of host response to sepsis. Both deficiency and excess disturb immune homeostasis and increase susceptibility, underscoring the need for precision-guided ApoE modulation in sepsis management. These findings provide a mechanistically grounded biomarker candidate and highlight new avenues for personalized therapy. Prospective trials are warranted to evaluate ApoE-targeted strategies in sepsis care."
41494172,Peripheral Vasopressor Administration in Adults With Sepsis: A Retrospective Study of Guideline Adherence and Complications.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) vasopressor administration is increasingly used to expedite the treatment of septic shock when central venous access is not immediately available. This shift in practice reflects growing support from national guidelines, which permit short-term peripheral administration of vasopressors in adults. On March 9, 2023, hospitals within 1 health care system implemented guidelines for PIVC vasopressor administration in adult critical care settings, specifically emergency departments and intensive care units. OBJECTIVE: This study examined adherence to these guidelines for PIVC vasopressor use and to identify associated complications. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study included 106 adult patients (68 emergency department and 38 intensive care unit patients) diagnosed with sepsis and receiving peripheral vasopressors. RESULTS: The majority of patients received norepinephrine through a short PIVC. Overall, 5 patients (4.7%) experienced complications, 4 with thrombophlebitis and 1 with an extravasation. All 5 patients received norepinephrine at the organization's policy-specified concentration via short PIVCs. However, only 1 of these patients met the system's guidelines for minimum PIVC size, quantity, and maximum infusion duration. Overall, only 58% of patients were managed in full compliance with the system's guidelines. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of standardized protocols to reduce complications associated with short-term peripheral vasopressor administration."
41493324,SBP: Always peritonitis in decompensated cirrhosis? Case report and review of the literature.,2025,"We report a case of a 56-year-old male with alcohol-associated liver cirrhosis presenting with septic and obstructive shock due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and pericarditis with tamponade. Imaging revealed ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion requiring drainage. Escherichia coli with identical resistance patterns was cultured from all drained fluids. Scintigraphy confirmed a peritoneal-pericardial connection. After initial treatment, fluid recurrences prompted evaluation for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, which was unfortunately complicated by severe bleeding, ultimately leading to multi-organ failure and death. This case highlights the exceptional occurrence of pericardial effusion and spontaneous bacterial pericarditis as well as peritonitis as a complication of decompensated cirrhosis, with confirmed connection between the pericardium and the abdominal cavity by nuclear tracer study, as well as microbiological evidence. Based on an overview of all published cases management includes diuretics, paracentesis and in refractory cases, TIPS. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment."
41492616,Biliary Sepsis Caused by Burkholderia cepacia: A Rare Presentation.,2025,"Burkholderia cepacia is notorious for causing nosocomial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, while extrapulmonary infections remain uncommon. We report the case of a 53-year-old man recently diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with liver and spine metastases who initially presented with obstructive jaundice. Laboratory workup revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Baseline chest X-ray showed a soft tissue density in the left lower lobe, and dynamic liver CT demonstrated multiple liver nodules suspicious for metastasis. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent insertion. Post-procedure, the patient developed a fever. He was managed as a case of cholangitis and started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Blood cultures grew B. cepacia, which was sensitive to meropenem, levofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole; therefore, antibiotics were shifted to meropenem. Despite this, he remained febrile. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed dilatation of both the hepatic and common bile ducts with the stent in place. The team proceeded with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Bile cultures again grew B. cepacia with the same sensitivities. Repeat blood cultures remained positive, so levofloxacin was added to meropenem. Two days after starting the combination regimen, the patient became afebrile. Subsequent blood cultures showed clearance. He was discharged in stable condition with two weeks of oral levofloxacin. B. cepacia should be considered a possible causative agent of nosocomial biliary tract infections in immunocompromised patients."
41489549,Tea seed-derived leucoside attenuates sepsis via inhibition of TLR4-MD2 complex formation.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition driven by dysregulated inflammation, remains a major clinical challenge due to high mortality rates and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory properties of Leucoside, a natural flavonoid isolated from tea seed extract, and its potential as a therapeutic agent for sepsis. Using a bacterial infection-induced septic mouse model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages, we demonstrated that Leucoside significantly improves survival rates, reduces hypothermia, and attenuates organ damage by suppressing systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, network pharmacology and molecular docking identified Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a primary target of Leucoside. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that Leucoside competitively binds to conserved positively charged residues in the B patch of TLR4, specifically Lys263 and Arg337, forming a spatial barrier that inhibits the formation of the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2)-TLR4 complex and subsequent nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling. This inhibition was further validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which showed a reduced effect on the TLR4-MD2 complex dissociation when Lys263 and Arg337 were mutated. These findings highlight Leucoside as a novel TLR4 inhibitor with significant potential for treating sepsis and other TLR4-mediated inflammatory diseases. By elucidating its mechanism of action, this study provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies to address the unmet clinical needs in sepsis management."
41488892,Ascariasis in a child with recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage: case report and literature review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the most common soil-transmitted helminth infections worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation. While most cases are asymptomatic, heavy infections can lead to serious complications including intestinal obstruction, biliary colic, and pancreatitis. This article reports a case of melena in a 4-year-old child associated with ascariasis and explores the potential pathological mechanisms and management strategies through a comprehensive literature review. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy was admitted with a one-month history of cough, lethargy for 4 days, and coma lasting 10 h. He had been diagnosed with septic shock, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at a local hospital, where he received endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and antimicrobial therapy before being transferred to our institution for further management. During hospitalization, he experienced recurrent melena, which required blood product transfusion to correct anemia. Further investigations eventually identified ascariasis as a potential underlying contributing factor. Melena in this patient was likely related to septic shock-induced coagulopathy or mucosal ischemia, rather than direct Ascaris injury. The patient was treated with albendazole, and ultimately made a full recovery and was discharged successfully. CONCLUSIONS: Ascaris lumbricoides infection represents a rare yet critical associated factor in septic shock complicated by severe gastrointestinal bleeding in children. This case report and literature review demonstrate that successful management hinges on early identification of the parasitic infection coupled with timely anthelmintic therapy following hemodynamic stabilization. However, the severe clinical manifestations are often directly caused by secondary bacterial infections. Clinicians, particularly those in endemic regions, require heightened vigilance for this potential complication."
41488477,In-host co-colonization and bloodstream infection by distinct classical and hypervirulent CRKP clones harboring a homologous bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid.,2025,"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) readily colonizes clinical environments as well as the respiratory and intestinal tracts of patients and can easily cause secondary infections, posing a serious threat to infection treatment and hospital infection control. In this study, we continuously tracked CRKP strains isolated from a single patient over a total of 16 weeks-from admission to the ICU until discharge from the general ward. A total of 21 CRKP strains were obtained, including 1 bloodstream infection (BSI) isolate, 8 respiratory tract colonization isolates, and 12 intestinal colonization isolates. All isolates were evaluated for their phenotypic characteristics related to antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity, and plasmid transfer through antimicrobial susceptibility testing, mouse infection models, and conjugation experiments. In parallel, whole-genome sequencing was performed to determine their MLST types, capsular serotypes, resistance and virulence genes, and plasmid profiles. The results showed that these isolates belonged to two distinct clones. One BSI isolate, along with one respiratory and one intestinal colonization isolate, belonged to the ST268 with capsular serotype KL20. This clone carried not only the typical hypervirulence (hv) genes aerobactin, colibactin, and rmpA2 but also a plasmid encoding bla (KPC-2), representing a classic CR-hvKP strain. Mouse infection models confirmed its high virulence. The remaining isolates belonged to the ST4496 clone, a member of the CC11 clonal complex commonly found in ICU outbreaks, with serotype KL47, exhibiting lower pathogenicity but carrying the same bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid as ST268, indicating horizontal plasmid transfer. In-host co-colonization by the distinct CRKP clones ST4496 and ST268 may have facilitated horizontal transfer of the bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid, enabling ST268 to evolve from hvKP into CR-hvKP and subsequently cause secondary BSI. This process, in which pathogen clones with different traits co-colonize and mutually promote evolutionary changes, may interfere with clinical treatment decisions and underscores the need for more intensive hospital infection surveillance."
41488103,Diagnostic potential of extended inflammation parameters for sepsis identification: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: An early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is critical for improving patient outcomes. Extended inflammation parameters (EIPs), derived from routine complete blood count (CBC) analysis, have emerged as promising biomarkers for inflammatory response. This study aimed to explore the diagnostic potential of a model combining several EIPs for identifying sepsis in a case-control setting. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center, case-control study was conducted at Tawam Hospital, AlAin, United Arab Emirates involving 157 participants; 53 patients with confirmed sepsis per Sepsis-3 criteria admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 104 control participants from outpatient clinics with no obvious evidence of infection. EIPs, including immature granulocyte count (IG#), neutrophil reactivity intensity (NEUT-RI), and reactive lymphocyte percentage per lymphocyte (RE-LYMP%/L), were retrieved from initial CBCs performed on a Sysmex XN-1000 analyzer. A three-parameter logarithmic model was developed, and its performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap iterations to estimate bias-corrected performance. RESULTS: The logarithmic model, i.e., log(IG# + 1) + log(NEUT-RI/100 + 1) + log(RE-LYMP%/L/50 + 1), combining IG#, NEUT-RI, and RE-LYMP%/L demonstrated high apparent discrimination for identifying sepsis, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.902-0.980), a sensitivity of 88.5% (95% CI: 77.0-95.8%), and a specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 84.2-96.0%). Bootstrap internal validation yielded an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.874-0.966), with minimal optimism (0.018), suggesting model stability within this dataset. CONCLUSION: A prediction model combining three different EIPs demonstrated high discrimination in a case-control setting, however this design of comparing ICU sepsis patients to healthy outpatient controls introduces severe spectrum bias characteristic of two-gate studies, which can inflate discrimination metrics significantly when compared with single-gate Emergency Department populations where diagnostic uncertainty is genuine. These results should be considered preliminary exploratory findings only. The extreme spectrum bias inherent to our case-control design means reported performance reflects statistical discrimination in an artificial scenario rather than real-world diagnostic accuracy, with expected ED performance substantially lower (estimated AUC 0.70-0.79). Rigorous prospective validation in consecutive ED patients with suspected infection, including head-to-head comparison with established biomarkers procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, is essential before any clinical consideration."
41488071,The association between coagulation function and prognosis in patients with sepsis: a meta-analysis of predictive performance introduction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units, is associated with coagulation dysfunction, a key pathological feature linked to multi-organ failure. However, the prognostic value of coagulation markers remains heterogeneous across studies. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients, focusing on their predictive performance. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, nine studies (n = 1954) were included from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The associations of coagulation markers (APTT, PT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, INR) and SOFA scores with the outcome were quantified using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Diagnostic accuracy was summarized by the area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic, and a random-effects model was employed to account for between-study variation. The robustness of the findings was evaluated through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Fibrinogen showed a significant inverse correlation with mortality [OR = 0.76, 95% CI (0.59-0.97)], while INR demonstrated moderate predictive ability (AUC = 0.68). APTT and PT had non-significant ORs but moderate AUCs (0.75 and 0.75, respectively). D-dimer and SOFA score ORs were non-significant, though SOFA's AUC indicated good prognostic utility. High heterogeneity (I (2) > 74%) and sensitivity to individual studies were noted. CONCLUSION: Specific coagulation markers, notably fibrinogen and INR, may aid in sepsis prognosis assessment, but variability across studies limits generalizability. Further high-quality studies are warranted to validate these findings. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251049209, identifier CRD420251049209."
41483663,Clinical and molecular characterization of a fulminant meningococcemia case in an adult caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y clonal complex 23 strain in China.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (NmY), first reported in China in 2015, remains rare, with only a few cases reported to date. Previously documented NmY invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases in China predominantly occurred among adolescents or children. This study reports the first confirmed adult IMD case caused by NmY in China. METHODS: A 22-year-old male in Guangdong Province presented with IMD symptoms. The causative agent (NmY20231109) was isolated from blood culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted for molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis against global NmY strains. RESULTS: The isolate (NmY20231109) was susceptible to most tested antibiotics but resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. WGS identified the strain as Y: P1.5-1,10-1: F4-1: ST-1655 (CC23). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NmY20231109 clustered closely with ST-1655 strains from the UK and Germany. It showed genetic distance from the four ST-1655 strains previously reported in China. Virulence gene profiling identified 52 associated genes, including key factors such as fHbp and porB. CONCLUSION: This report describes the first adult IMD case caused by NmY in China. The identification of NmY20231109 as ST-1655 (CC23), closely related to European strains, suggests a potential imported origin and highlights the ongoing risk of NmY transmission in China."
41483497,Elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling correlates with myocardial PANoptosis in septic rats.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction driven by dysregulated host responses to infection. While PANoptosis-a coordinated cell death pathway-has emerged as a critical process in inflammatory diseases, its role in sepsis and regulatory interactions with the miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis remains unexplored. This study aimed to determine PANoptosis activation in sepsis, elucidate the mechanistic involvement of miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB in PANoptosis regulation, and assess associated pathological outcomes. METHODS: Cross-dataset analyses revealed functional linkages between miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling and PANoptotic pathways. Clinical validation included serum collection from sepsis patients and healthy controls, with miR-145 quantified via qPCR and PANoptosis-related proteins measured by ELISA. A rat sepsis model was established via cecal ligation and puncture, followed by miR-145 expression profiling, PANoptotic factor detection, and myocardial histopathological evaluation using HE/TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Results demonstrated significant upregulation of miR-145, TLR4, NF-kappaB, PANoptotic markers, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis patients versus controls. CLP rats exhibited parallel increases in these biomarkers alongside pronounced myocardial injury, including histopathological disruption and elevated apoptosis. Correlation analyses confirmed miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis activation as a key modulator of PANoptosis and tissue damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of PANoptosis activation in sepsis, indicating a correlative link with elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling. These findings propose a novel pathogenic framework for sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and highlight therapeutic targets for modulating inflammatory cell death pathways."
41480135,Statistical Study for the Prognostic Value of NLR Values in Patients with Severe Burns: A Study in the Service of Burns in Albania.,2025,"The phases of burn care include initial resuscitation, definitive wound management, and rehabilitation of physical and psychological injuries. In severe burns, this response lasts for the first two to three days post-burn and burns larger than 15% of total body surface area lead to the initiation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory biomarker that can indicate systemic inflammation. NLR is defined by the absolute number of neutrophils divided by the absolute number of lymphocytes. Many studies have been done in severe burn patients because they reflect changes in the systemic inflammatory response. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NLR values in patients with severe burns and provide clinical guidance for sepsis and mortality. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Service of Burns of the University Hospital Centre ""Mother Teresa"" in Tirana (UHCT), Albania. We compared NLR levels in burn patients with sepsis and without sepsis. Our data showed a significantly higher level of NLR in burn patients with sepsis, while the values of NLR on the 3rd day (NLR 3) have statistical significance (p<0.0001). From the logistic regression analysis, we found that only NLR 3 can predict mortality, whose cut-off (4.59) was determined with the help of ROC curve analysis and was accurately presented with the help of Kaplan-Meier curves with statistical significance. From multiple regression, we understand that mortality can be predicted based on TBSA%, age, presence of inhalatory burn, and NLR 3 together."
41479625,[Efficiency and Usefulness of the Molecular Test 'Biofire((R))Filmarray((R)) Blood Culture Identification 2' in the Quick Diagnosis of Bacteraemias in a Burns Intensive Care Unit].,2025,"The occurrence of bacteremia during a hospital stay worsens the prognosis of patients. Especially in burn patients, it is one of the most severe infectious complications during their stay in intensive care units, with high mortality rates. Consequently, rapid detection of the pathogens responsible is crucial for the prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy. In our study, we analysed 85 positive blood cultures collected from 66 patients hospitalised in the burns unit and presenting criteria for sepsis. The results of the molecular test FilmArray BCID2 were compared with those of conventional microbiology methods. Overall, the results of the BCID2 panel were concordant with those of conventional culture in 71.8% of cases. For monomicrobial cultures, the concordance of identification was 83.9%, while for polymicrobial cultures the concordance was 36.4%. The test showed a good performance in the detection of pathogens, with an overall sensitivity of 84.5% and specificity of 98.3%; for the panel targets these rates rose to 95.4% and 98.1% respectively. For resistance genes, the BCID2 detected the blaCTX-M gene in 9 enterobacteria and the carbapenemase genes: blaNDM, blaOXA-48- like, blaVIM in 20 BGN. The mecA/C gene was isolated from 5 Staphylococcus epidermidis and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus the vanA/B gene was detected in 3 Enterococcus faecuim. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for detecting resistance genes were 84.1% and 92%. The turnaround time (TAT) for molecular test results was 1 hour and 10min (Q1 1.09 h; Q3 1.12 h). The median TAT for BCID2 was significantly (Mann-Whitney, p<0.0001) shorter than for conventional culture 39.1 h (Q1 33 h; Q3 57.6 h). Antimicrobial therapy was modified on the basis of the molecular test results in 35.3% of patients. This was done within a median of 04 hours of receiving the test result [interquartile range 2.4h - 21h]. A favorable outcome was noted in 70% of these patients."
41479436,A Twist in the Tale: The Unmasking of Listeria in a PMR Case.,2026,"In general, an older patient presenting with proximal muscle pain and fatigue, with elevated inflammatory markers, would generally result in an extensive evaluation. If this is negative, it would be reasonable for a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) to be made and the patient referred to rheumatology. Our patient presented myalgia in proximal muscles and an elevated sedimentation rate. He was treated with steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica with improvement. He was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where a diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes sepsis was made and treated. With antibiotics he improved and was discharged from the hospital. This Case Report underscores the importance of considering unusual infections when entertaining a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) as the cause of systemic inflammatory response syndrome."
41478272,Reevaluating isolated central apnea in early-term and term newborns: A neurological red flag for perinatal stroke.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Seizures are the most frequent initial symptom of perinatal stroke. Apnea, a less commonly recognized neurological presentation, is a cessation of breathing lasting >15 s or shorter if associated with bradycardia. This study explores a monocentric cohort of newborns with perinatal stroke, emphasizing the role of Isolated Central Apnea (ICA) as a potential early indicator of cerebrovascular insult. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on newborns (>/=36 weeks GA) diagnosed with MRI-confirmed perinatal stroke at our institution between March 2019 and March 2024. Infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), congenital infections, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or intrauterine stroke were excluded. Clinical data, neuroimaging findings, EEG/aEEG characteristics, and antiepileptic drug (AED) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 421 newborns who underwent brain MRI, 27 (6 %) were diagnosed with perinatal stroke (16 males; median GA 38.5 weeks; mean BW 3137g). Seizures were the presenting symptom in 18 cases (67 %), while 8 cases (30 %) exhibited ICA as the first sign and an MRI revealing 5 arterial strokes (63 %) and 3 venous strokes (37 %). EEG abnormalities were detected in 7/8 (88 %) cases, while brain ultrasound was abnormal in 5/8 (63 %). AED therapy was required in 7/8 (88 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS: ICA is an early sign of neonatal stroke in approximately one-third of cases. These findings underscore the importance of brain MRI in the diagnostic workup of persistent apnea in term and early-term neonates."
41478161,Ensemble machine learning for early mortality risk stratification in septic orthopedic trauma: an international cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a life-threatening complication in severe orthopedic trauma, significantly increasing short-term mortality risk. Despite the clinical urgency for early prognosis assessment, current predictive tools remain inadequate. To address this gap, this study used a machine learning (ML)-based framework for mortality risk stratification in this high-risk population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study established ML models to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with orthopedic trauma and sepsis. Data from 2,060 eligible patients were extracted from the intensive care unit (ICU) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2008-2019) in the United State and randomly split into training (80 %) and internal validation (20 %) sets. After handling missing data and addressing class imbalance, seven ML algorithms (including CatBoost [Categorical Boosting], RF [Random Forest], and SVM [Support Vector Machine]) were trained and optimized using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed based on discrimination (AUC [Area Under the Curve], accuracy, F1-score), calibration (Brier score, calibration slope), and clinical utility. The top-performing models were further validated on an independent external Chinese cohort (n = 273, 2020-2024). RESULTS: The study cohort had a mean age of 62.8 years and a 30-day mortality rate of 19.9 % (410/2060). Non-survivors were significantly older, had a higher comorbidity burden, and more severe physiological derangements. The LASSO analysis identified 16 prognostic variables, with age, hematologic parameters (RDW, WBC), SOFA scores, hemodynamic measures (SBP), and antihypertensive therapy emerging as significant predictors. Among all models, the CatBoost algorithm demonstrated superior performance in the internal validation set, achieving the highest AUC (0.955), accuracy (0.884), and F1-score (0.878), along with excellent calibration (Brier score: 0.081). A soft voting ensemble model, integrating the top three algorithms (CatBoost, RF, SVM), was subsequently constructed. In external validation, this ensemble model generalized robustly, maintaining strong discrimination (AUC: 0.842, Accuracy: 0.737) and calibration (Brier score: 0.173), outperforming the standalone CatBoost model. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis provided interpretable, individualized risk assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This study trains, optimizes, and evaluates a high-performing ML-based prediction model for 30-day mortality in patients with critical orthopedic trauma and sepsis. The CatBoost model and the soft voting ensemble, particularly the latter, demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical utility, offering a potential tool for early risk stratification and personalized management in this vulnerable population."
41478040,"SERS on analyte-enriched blood for rapid, culture-free sepsis recognition and causative pathogen identification with super operational neural networks.",2026,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, yet routine diagnostics are slow, culture-dependent, and often lack the sensitivity or specificity required for early intervention. Prior studies rarely demonstrate clinical-grade performance on blood culture samples or in independent external cohorts. We address these gaps with a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and deep learning workflow (SERS-DL) that performs sepsis instance recognition and causative pathogen identification directly from target-analyte enriched blood. We assembled a primary dataset of SERS spectra acquired from 653 analyte-enriched blood samples collected at a tertiary hospital in Qatar and an external blind cohort of 70 independent samples. After rigorous preprocessing and class-weighted augmentation of SERS spectra, we trained SuperRamanNet, a lightweight one-dimensional classifier based on super operational neural networks. In five-fold, sample-contained cross-validation, the system achieved 99.67 % accuracy for binary sepsis recognition and 98.84 % accuracy for six-class pathogen identification. On the external cohort, performance remained high at 98.28 % for pathogen typing, indicating robust generalizability. Comparative benchmarks and ablation studies confirmed consistent gains over convolutional and operational baselines and quantified the impact of augmentation and architectural choices. Residual confusions were concentrated between control and Escherichia coli and among certain Gram-negative classes, underscoring the need for improved raw class balance during blood sample collection. Overall, this rapid, culture-free, and portable SERS-DL pipeline delivers near clinical-grade accuracy for sepsis detection and pathogen identification directly from blood. The compact model and streamlined workflow support point-of-care translation, with potential to accelerate triage, guide early therapy, and reduce the global sepsis burden."
41477926,Subsequent risk of death from sepsis among over 6 million cancer patients: A population-based cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer patients, particularly due to the immunosuppressive effects of both malignancy and its treatments. This study aims to assess the risk of sepsis-related mortality in cancer patients, identify the effects of various cancer types and demographic factors, and provide insights for developing targeted preventive strategies. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which includes approximately 26.5 % of the U.S. POPULATION: The analysis covered 6,891,191 cancer patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2021. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated to compare sepsis-related mortality risk in cancer patients with the general population. Key variables included cancer type, age, gender, race, and marital status. RESULTS: Of the 6,891,191 cancer patients included, 25,232 (0.37 %) died from sepsis. The overall SMR was 1.52 (95 % CI: 1.50-1.54), with an AER of 2.15 (95 % CI: 2.05-2.25) per 10,000 person-years. Patients with brain and other nervous system cancers (SMR = 5.74, 95 % CI: 4.95-6.61), respiratory system cancers (SMR = 3.52, 95 % CI: 3.38-3.66), and hematologic malignancies such as myeloma (SMR = 3.25, 95 % CI: 2.97-3.55) exhibited high sepsis-related mortality risks. Disparities were observed, with elevated risks in female patients (SMR = 1.64, 95 % CI: 1.61-1.67), American Indian/Alaska Native patients (SMR = 4.23, 95 % CI: 3.50-5.07), and single (never married) individuals (SMR = 2.50, 95 % CI: 2.42-2.58). Mortality risk was most pronounced within the first two months following cancer diagnosis, with an SMR of 7.37 (95 % CI: 7.14-7.61). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a significantly increased risk of sepsis-related mortality among cancer patients, highlighting the need for improved infection prevention, early interventions, and tailored strategies. Multidisciplinary care and enhanced support for high-risk groups are essential to mitigate sepsis-related complications and improve outcomes."
41477766,Aromatic microbial metabolite hippuric acid enhances inflammatory responses in macrophages via TLR-MyD88 signaling and lipid remodeling.,2026,"The gut microbiome produces diverse metabolites shaping immunity, yet their pro-inflammatory potential remains unclear. Using untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, we identified hippuric acid-an aromatic, microbe-derived metabolite-as a potent enhancer of inflammatory responses during Escherichia coli infection. Hippuric acid administration heightened inflammation, activated innate immune cells, and reduced survival in infected mice. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] or LPS+interferon gamma [IFNgamma]) macrophage pro-inflammatory responses but had no effect on M2-like (interleukin [IL]-4) polarization. It enhanced responses to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands but not TRIF-, STING-, or NOD2-mediated stimuli. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abolished hippuric-acid-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed increased cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid accumulation, while reducing cellular cholesterol blunted the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid. Notably, hippuric acid also enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with sepsis mortality, linking microbial metabolism, lipid remodeling, and innate immunity."
41477655,Crohn's Disease Diagnosed Intraoperatively During a Trauma Exploratory Laparotomy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, commonly presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, typically leading to diagnosis through endoscopic or imaging studies. Its incidental discovery during emergent trauma surgery is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 25-year-old male who sustained blunt abdominal trauma in a dirt-bike accident, presenting to the emergency department the same day with progressive abdominal pain. Emergent exploratory laparotomy for a suspected bowel perforation revealed characteristic ""creeping fat,"" inflammatory adhesions, and an enterocolonic fistula, suggesting undiagnosed Crohn's disease. The presence of acute inflammation necessitated extended small bowel resection and precluded primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent intra-abdominal abscesses, including a subhepatic collection measuring 5.7 x 2.6 x 5 cm, as well as pleural effusions, necessitating multiple drainage procedures, targeted antibiotics, and nutritional optimization. A multidisciplinary team-including trauma surgeons, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, and interventional radiologists-collaborated to manage both acute injuries and the newly recognized chronic inflammatory condition. Final pathology revealed multifocal colonic mucosal ulceration with acute inflammation, ileocolic fistula formation, and colonic perforation, consistent with a penetrating (fistulizing) phenotype, ileocolonic Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad diagnostic perspective during trauma surgery and highlights how an unrecognized inflammatory bowel disease can complicate postoperative recovery. Early suspicion and tailored interventions are crucial for mitigating complications such as abscess formation and sepsis. A prompt gastroenterology consult and confirmatory investigations are recommended to guide long-term management of Crohn's disease. Ultimately, this report underscores that vigilance for atypical findings in emergent settings can significantly improve patient outcomes."
41477644,Predictive models of immune microenvironment-related markers in patients with sepsis accompanied by myocardial dysfunction and their roles in diagnosis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate immune microenvironment markers for predicting sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) and establish three predictive models-nomogram, decision tree, and gradient boosting machine (GBM)-to compare their efficacy in assessing SIMD risk. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 165 patients with sepsis who were admitted between January 2022 and February 2025. Patients were divided into SIMD and non-SIMD groups according to the occurrence of SIMD. Risk factors influencing the occurrence of SIMD in patients with sepsis were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomogram, decision tree, and GBM models were constructed based on the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discrimination of each model. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores of the three models were calculated. RESULT: : Among the 165 patients with sepsis included in the study, 75 were in the SIMD group, accounting for 45.45% (75/165). Univariate analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in APACHE II score, white blood cell count, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a high APACHE II score (OR = 1.480, 95% CI: 1.127-1.945), high NT-proBNP level (OR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.005-1.021), high sTREM-1 level (OR = 1.116, 95% CI: 1.034-1.205), and high HMGB1 level (OR = 1.006, 95% CI: 1.002-1.011) were risk factors for SIMD in patients with sepsis (P < 0.05). All three prediction models demonstrated excellent performance in the training set: nomogram (AUC = 0.843), decision tree (AUC = 0.815), and GBM (AUC = 0.885). No significant differences were observed in the AUC values among the models (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The immune markers, sTREM-1 and HMGB1, were associated with SIMD. Elevated APACHE II score and NT-proBNP, sTREM-1, and HMGB1 levels are risk factors for SIMD in patients with sepsis. Predictive models based on these factors demonstrate strong performance and effectively identify high-risk individuals, aiding in early clinical intervention."
41477560,Neonatal Sepsis in Dogs Caused by Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus Sourced From Maternal Mastitis-Case Report.,2025,"Bacterial infections are common during the neonatal period, and sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality in dogs in the first 21 days. Maternal clinical and subclinical mastitis is one of the main sources of neonatal infection, leading to the ingestion of milk with bacteria and bacterial toxins, known as toxic milk syndrome. The objective of this report was to describe a case of neonatal sepsis in puppies secondary to maternal clinical mastitis, as well as its diagnosis and treatment. Three 5-day-old Pug dogs presented signs of neonatal infection: diarrhea, body erythema, and omphalitis. The bitch had purulent content in all of her breasts. Leukopenia due to neutropenia and monocytosis was observed in the puppies' blood count. The milk microbiological culture revealed beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, which was sensitive to antibiotics from the cephalosporin and penicillin classes according to the antibiogram. The puppies were separated from their mother, fed with breast milk substitute, and treated with ceftriaxone. The mother was treated with amoxicillin with potassium clavulanate. Neonatal and maternal infections were responsive to the antibiotics used, demonstrating the absence of signs of infection and blood counts without changes after 7 days of treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment were essential for the survival of the litter."
41477440,Congenital Tuberculous Lymphadenitis in a Preterm Neonate Born to a Comatose Mother in a High TB-Burden Setting: A Case Report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Congenital tuberculosis (TB) is a rare but often fatal condition, particularly in preterm neonates within high-burden regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Diagnosis is complicated by nonspecific symptoms and resource limitations, with maternal critical illness further delaying detection and increasing vertical transmission risk. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report details a preterm male infant (30 weeks' gestation) born vaginally to an HIV-negative mother who experienced a 2-month coma during pregnancy in the DRC. The neonate presented at 3 weeks with cervical lymphadenopathy, respiratory distress, and failure to thrive. Initial sepsis treatment with antibiotics failed. Postpartum maternal sputum testing confirmed pulmonary TB. Neonatal lymph node biopsy revealed caseating granulomas, and GeneXpert MTB/RIF confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The infant received weight-adjusted antitubercular therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide), leading to progressive clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: This case underscores congenital TB as a critical differential diagnosis in preterm infants with lymphadenopathy born to critically ill mothers in TB-endemic areas. Maternal coma-a likely indicator of disseminated TB-masked symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and amplified transmission risk. The report advocates for integrating routine TB screening into antenatal care protocols for all critically ill pregnant women in high-burden settings, irrespective of overt respiratory symptoms. Early maternal diagnosis and prompt neonatal treatment are essential to reduce mortality in this vulnerable population. Enhanced screening in high-risk pregnancies represents an urgent public health priority for mitigating vertical TB transmission in resource-limited contexts."
41477408,Diagnostic Challenges in Capnocytophaga canimorsus Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections, though rare, can be severe. Diagnosis is straightforward with a known dog-bite history, but is challenging otherwise. A 67-year-old woman with no immunodeficiency or alcohol abuse history presented with high fever (41.5 degrees C), vomiting, and altered consciousness. No neck stiffness or peritoneal irritation was observed. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzymes, creatine kinase, inflammatory markers, and lactate. Computed tomography suggested strangulated ileus, which was ruled out during emergency laparotomy. Postoperatively, she experienced shock and was treated with vasopressors, corticosteroids, and ampicillin-sulbactam. Her condition improved, and blood culture showed Gram-negative rods. On day 3, her husband mentioned a recent dog bite, and a Capnocytophaga infection was suspected. Continued treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam improved her symptoms, and she was discharged. Blood cultures confirmed C. canimorsus on day 10. In severe sepsis with delayed bacterial identification, C. canimorsus should be considered. Repeated history-taking and empirical beta-lactamase inhibitor treatment are crucial."
41477006,"Clinical, genomic, and functional characterization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci from immunocompromised patients: insights into epithelial dysfunction and bloodstream infections.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) are increasingly recognized as major opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients, where they may cause bloodstream infections (BSIs). The present study aimed to characterize a cohort of immunocompromised patients colonized or infected with VRE, performing genomic analysis of these isolates. Additionally, we investigated the impact of bacterial culture supernatants on Caco-2 epithelial cells, focusing on adhesion and cytotoxicity to elucidate mechanisms related to epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 46 VRE from two Italian hospitals. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected, and isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. Four representative isolates (E. faecium ST80, E. faecium ST117, E. faecalis ST28, and E. faecalis ST179) and two reference strains (ATCC 29212 and ATCC 51299) were selected for in vitro analyses. Adhesion to Caco-2 monolayers was quantified, while cytotoxicity was assessed using MTT assays with bacterial cell-free supernatants (CS). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production was measured using the Amplex((R)) Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were E. faecium (78.3%), predominantly ST80 and ST117, possessed multiple resistance determinants. E. faecalis isolates displayed greater sequence type diversity with a ST28 predominance, carrying virulence genes as ebp, gelE, and elrA. In vitro, bloodstream-derived isolates (E. faecium 51, E. faecalis 52) and reference strain ATCC 29212 adhered more strongly to Caco-2 cells than other isolates. CS from invasive isolates and ATCC 51299 significantly reduced epithelial cell viability at 24 h (p < 0.01). In these isolates, H(2)O(2) higher quantification was documented in a cellular model. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the convergence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits in VRE, alongside functional evidence of strain-dependent adhesion and secretion of cytotoxic metabolites. Elevated H(2)O(2) production provides a possible path between enterococcal secretomes and epithelial injury, suggesting oxidative stress as a contributor to epithelial dysfunction and potential translocation. These insights expand current understanding of VRE pathogenesis and point to novel therapeutic approaches aimed at preserving epithelial integrity and mitigating oxidative damage in high-risk patients."
41476946,Bacterial cell-free DNA profiling reveals the co-elevation of multiple bacteria in newborn foals with suspected sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, yet current diagnostics lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Here, we present a foal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing for bacterial identification (cfFBI) workflow that integrates wet-lab and computational protocols, enabling direct bacterial profiling through enrichment of the bacterial cfDNA and minimization of false-positive detections. We applied cfFBI to blood from 25 hospitalized foals and 7 healthy foals (H). Sepsis-associated bacterial genera were elevated in all 11 nSIRS-positive (S+) foals compared to H, and in 8/11 when compared to both nSIRS-negative (nS-) and H, with multiple genera elevated in nearly half (45.5%). While total cfDNA concentration, bacterial fraction, and microbial diversity did not differ between groups, S+ foals showed distinct cfDNA end-motif patterns and reduced mitochondrial cfDNA fractions. These findings indicate that cfDNA sequencing enables the detection of pathogenic bacteria and can help identify additional (host-related) sepsis biomarkers."
41476761,Plasma Bile Acid Profiling Reveals Novel Early Diagnostic Biomarkers for Pediatric Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early detection remains a challenge. While bile acids have been implicated in various diseases, their role as biomarkers for sepsis is underexplored. This study aims to identify metabolites associated with sepsis and assess the potential of bile acids for early diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric sepsis. METHODS: We enrolled 100 participants in the discovery phase and 141 participants in the validation phase. Non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites between sepsis patients and healthy controls. Targeted quantitative analysis of 12 plasma bile acids (BA) was conducted to assess their concentrations. Machine learning algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine-RFE (SVM-RFE), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), were employed to identify key BAs for sepsis diagnosis. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics revealed bile acid pathway dysregulation, validated by targeted quantification showing elevated primary bile acids-cholic acid (CA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA)-and taurine-conjugated secondary bile acid TDCA (p<0.05). Conversely, secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA) were significantly reduced (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression identified TCA, TDCA, GCA, TCDCA, GCDCA, and TDCA/DCA as risk factors for sepsis, while LCA, DCA, UDCA, GUDCA, and DCA/CA were protective factors. Five machine learning models identified four bile acid indicators-UDCA, GUDCA, GCA, DCA-as key predictors for sepsis diagnosis, with a combined model area under the curve (AUC) of 0.880. Additionally, DCA/CA and GCDCA were important predictors for septic shock, with risks increasing by 4.5% (OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.009-1.081) and 30% (OR = 0.700, 95% CI: 0.526-0.932), respectively. LCA was a risk factor for respiratory failure in sepsis, with an OR of 2.154 (95% CI: 1.022-4.540). CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential of bile acid profiling as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pediatric sepsis. These findings suggest a path toward early intervention, improving patient outcomes by enabling timely detection and treatment."
41476634,Corneal perforation in the setting of NK/T-cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe systemic inflammation caused by pathologic immune dysregulation and resulting in multiorgan destruction(4). While ocular manifestations are recognized in HLH, corneal perforation has not been well-described in published reports. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 26-year-old male who developed a spontaneous corneal perforation in the setting of NK/T-cell lymphoma-associated HLH. The patient was transferred to our hospital with a progressively enlarging fungating facial mass and severe bilateral eyelid edema, as well as fevers, sepsis, pancytopenia and transaminitis. Biopsy of the facial mass was consistent with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), and the patient was diagnosed with HLH presumed secondary to his malignancy. Ophthalmic examination revealed a corneal perforation of his left eye. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was taken to the operating room for repair of the perforation with a corneal patch graft. Postoperative management included topical corticosteroids and antibiotics. After surgery, the patient's left eye visual acuity was 20/100. Three months later, his visual acuity was 20/30 and the corneal patch graft appeared well-healed. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential for HLH to cause corneal perforation as a severe ocular complication. Prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are crucial for optimizing outcomes in such complex cases."
41476244,Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: recent insights on the role and clinical application of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.,2025,"Sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection. Neutrophils play a vital role in this process, which can lead to immunothrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This study aimed to validate the impact of NETs biomarkers in evaluating their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic indicators in critical care for patients with sepsis. We conducted a case-control study with a 7-day follow-up to assess mortality in 138 sepsis patients, focusing specifically on the occurrence of DIC. Additionally, 80 healthy volunteers, matched by age and sex, served as controls. Our findings reveal a strong connection between histones in sepsis and both the initial inflammatory response and sepsis-related coagulopathy/DIC. Furthermore, we found that myeloperoxidase can effectively predict short-term mortality among sepsis patients, regardless of their DIC status. This study highlights a concerning simultaneous increase in myeloperoxidase and histones (thresholds of > 84.9 ng/ml and > 126.4 ng/ml, respectively), which may serve as vital indicators indicating the urgent need for NETs inhibitors in sepsis treatment. Applying this approach, we anticipate a significant reduction in thrombotic events and mortality, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes in the management of critical sepsis."
41475068,"IL-8-, IL-12-, and VEGF-producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells enable differentiation between vertebral osteomyelitis and degenerative spinal diseases.",2026,"Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is a rare but serious spinal infection that presents significant challenges in early diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic delays can result in severe complications, including neurological deficits, sepsis, organ failure, and death. In this study, we investigated the immune cell source of candidate cytokines - IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and VEGF - with the aim of distinguishing VO from degenerative spinal diseases. Peripheral blood samples were collected pre-operatively and 40 to 56 days post-operatively. Cytokine production by major immune cell subsets within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed using intracellular flow cytometry. Our findings indicate that pre-operative differentiation between VO and degenerative spinal diseases is feasible, particularly based on IL-8-positive CD8(+) T-cells, IL-12-positive CD45(+) lymphocytes, and VEGF-positive cells (including CD45(+) cells, B-cells, T-cells, and CD8(+) T-cells)."
41475067,Shared inflammation in takotsubo syndrome and sepsis: Lipocalin-2 mediates neutrophil infiltration and cardiac damage.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) and sepsis often co-occur with poor outcomes, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Transcriptomic analysis is employed to detect diagnostic biomarkers and reveal shared pathophysiological mechanisms in sepsis-associated TTS. METHODS: Myocardial gene expression data (TTS, sepsis, and controls) from GEO were analyzed to identify shared differentially expressed genes. WGCNA and PPI networks were used for candidate gene selection. Key genes were further refined using random forest and LASSO algorithms. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT. Myocardial injury and gene expression in rat models were evaluated using HE staining, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blotting. Clinical validation was conducted using plasma samples from the China TTS Registry. t-tests and ANOVA were conducted via GraphPad Prism 8 software. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was recognized as an important biomarker through WGCNA, PPI network analysis, and machine learning algorithms, showing strong predictive performance. Its expression was significantly associated with neutrophil infiltration and myocardial injury in TTS. Consistent with the bioinformatics findings, the TTS-sepsis comorbidity model showed elevated mRNA and protein levels of LCN2 in myocardial tissue, accompanied by increased neutrophil infiltration and severe cardiac injury. Clinical validation confirmed elevated plasma LCN2 levels in patients with sepsis-associated TTS, correlating with neutrophil counts, NT-proBNP, and cTnI levels. CONCLUSION: LCN2 is identified as a key inflammatory mediator linking neutrophil-driven inflammation to myocardial injury in sepsis-associated TTS, with dual potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target."
41475060,Unveiling TCM-antibiotic synergy through multi-omics: Shuganning injection potentiates the effect of linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant threat to global public health due to its multidrug resistance, highlighting the need for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Computational repurposing has predicted that Shuganning injection (SGN), a clinically used hepatoprotective traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits synergistic activity with antibiotics against MRSA. However, the antimicrobial properties of SGN remain insufficiently characterized. PURPOSE: To evaluate the anti-MRSA activity of SGN and to elucidate the mechanism underlying its synergy with linezolid (LZD). METHODS: The components of SGN were identified using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Antimicrobial potential was predicted through computational repurposing and validated through bactericidal and synergy assays. Biofilm inhibition, morphological changes, and cell wall integrity were assessed. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics were employed to investigate SGN-LZD synergy. Key findings were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR and confirmed through targeted pharmacological inhibition. Finally, in vivo efficacy was assessed in Galleria mellonella and murine skin infection models. RESULTS: Fifty-two components were identified in SGN. Computational repurposing analysis indicated that SGN reversed sepsis-associated gene dysregulation and inhibited the growth of clinically isolated MRSA417, with corresponding MIC and MBC values of 42.5 and 170 mg/mL (crude drug equivalent), respectively. SGN demonstrated partial synergy with LZD (FICI = 0.75). The combination markedly inhibited MRSA biofilm formation by 94.25%, compared to 40.40% for SGN alone. Sub-MIC combinations caused structural damage, evidenced by increased extracellular alkaline phosphatase levels and disrupted bacterial morphology. Multi-omics analysis indicated co-downregulation of two-component system (TCS)-related metabolites (e.g., L-malic acid) and genes (saeRS, vraSR), indicating TCS suppression as the key mechanism underlying SGN-LZD synergy. The combination downregulated key TCS mRNAs. Furthermore, TCS inhibitors did not enhance its anti-biofilm and antibacterial effects. Notably, the SGN-LZD combination improved survival in G. mellonella and promoted wound healing in a murine skin infection model. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the repositioning of SGN for MRSA treatment. SGN impairs TCS-mediated virulence regulation, cell envelope integrity, and essential metabolic pathways, thereby enhancing the efficacy of LZD. These findings offer a translational framework for drug repurposing and highlight the clinical potential of SGN-LZD combination therapy for drug-resistant infections."
41474875,Infective Endocarditis: Severe Complication from a Common Procedure.,2025,"We describe an Army Officer with infectious endocarditis af-ter being hospitalized with a heat injury while participating in Special Forces Assessment and Selection. A 26-year-old other-wise healthy male presented with a fever, skin lesions, and pain at his IV site after a recent hospitalization. He was admitted on intravenous antibiotics due to suspicion of bacteremia and was eventually diagnosed with MRSA endocarditis. The pa-tient required months of antibiotics and left brachial vein exci-sion for source control. After multiple readmissions for MRSA bacteremia over the following 2 years, the patient was placed on daily prophylactic doxycycline. Due to complications from his condition, the patient was medically retired from the Army. When the tactical setting allows, prehospital providers must practice aseptic techniques and advocate for their patients when other providers lack awareness of the impact of field environments."
41474350,Nongonococcal urethritis can come from Neisseria: A case of N. meningitidis urethritis.,2025,"Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative organism known to cause invasive bacterial disease including meningitis and sepsis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a pathogen in the same genus and causes gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted infection that often manifests as urethritis. N. meningitidis can also cause urethritis, yet diagnosis is difficult as it is not detectable on routine gonococcal testing. We present a case of a patient with N. meningitidis urethritis, and discuss the epidemiology and approach to diagnosis and treatment of this illness. It is important to keep N. meningitidis in the differential diagnosis for patients with nongonococcal urethritis."
41474331,Effect of oral beta-lactam dosing on outcomes of bacteremic Gram-negative urinary tract infections: a real-world analysis.,2026,"Among 452 adult patients with Gram-negative bacteremia from a urinary tract infection source who received oral step-down therapy with highly bioavailable oral beta-lactam, we observed no difference in 60-day recurrence in patients treated with higher consensus-recommended dosing compared to lower, standard dosing (odds ratio = 0.76 [95% confidence interval = 0.43-1.32]), although the directionality of the effect was favorable. The study was limited by inadequate sample size and confounding. Randomized or large observational comparative effectiveness studies are needed.IMPORTANCEDefinitive treatment of Gram-negative bacteremia with oral antibiotic agents is not one size fits all. Use of oral fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is evidence-based but carries risk for adverse events. Data supporting the use of oral beta-lactams are mixed, likely in part due to variable agent selection and dosing. This analysis shows that higher, consensus-recommended dosing of highly bioavailable beta-lactam antibiotics was not significantly different from patients treated with lower dosing on 60-day recurrence. Our study was limited by the number of patients with discrete MICs and overinfluence of complicated urinary tract infection on outcomes."
41473918,Challenging neonatal central nervous system fungal infection diagnosed by MRI: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Although central nervous system fungal infection (CNSF) is uncommon, it is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. Here, we report a full-term female neonate with suspected CNSF diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) despite repeatedly negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures, in whom the causative pathogen could not be identified. CASE PRESENTATION: A full-term female neonate presented on the first day of life with irritability, hypoactivity, cyanosis, poor feeding, and two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with up-rolling of the eyes and lip smacking. Workup for neonatal sepsis showed negative CSF and blood cultures. MRI findings suggested CNSF, and treatment was initiated with low-dose conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks, leading to complete clinical and radiological resolution. CONCLUSION: Negative CSF and blood cultures do not exclude neonatal CNSF. In resource-limited settings, MRI findings together with clinical response to antifungal therapy may support a diagnosis of probable CNSF, even when the pathogen is not identified and standard high-dose regimens are not available."
41473889,Building a transdisciplinary network to improve survival in children with cancer in Colombia: seeds to forests.,2025,"Childhood cancer mortality is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. The World Health Organization Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer aims for a survival of 60% by 2030. This initiative prioritizes timely diagnosis, access to standardized therapy and supportive care, and prompt management of treatment-related complications. Collaborative work is linked to better performance of health systems and delivery of high-quality care. While collaborative strategies between high- and lower-income countries can advance cancer care in low- and middle-income countries, local and regional initiatives are essential to improve clinical outcomes. The high treatment-related mortality in children with cancer in low- and middle-income countries highlights the critical need to collaborate. To decrease treatment-related mortality in children with cancer in Colombia, a new model of transdisciplinary collaboration was built among Colombian scientific societies (pediatrics, pediatric hematology/oncology, infectious diseases, critical care), academic institutions, grassroots foundations, and the Colombian Childhood Cancer Clinical Outcomes Surveillance System: VIGICANCER. The network supports resource and knowledge exchange to tackle public health challenges related to accessing cancer care for children. It enables the design of targeted and tiered multilevel interventions to enhance quality of care for Colombian children and adolescents with cancer. This transdisciplinary network aims to improve survival in Colombian children with cancer and close the gap with high-income countries by establishing data-informed targets and developing a strategic roadmap to address sepsis, the most actionable cause of treatment-related mortality. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the number of years of life lost, thereby supporting societal progress in Latin America."
41473675,"Analysis of PANoptosis-related genes in septic cardiomyopathy by bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation.",2026,"The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) are intricate and incompletely understood. PANoptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death, and in the present study, bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation were used to identify key PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) associated with SCM. Differentially expressed genes were obtained through analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, and these genes were intersected with the PRGs to obtain the differentially expressed PRGs. Three machine learning algorithms were used to screen key PRGs; CIBERSORT was used for immune infiltration analysis and the diagnostic value of key PRGs was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves. Additionally, a competitive endogenous (ce)RNA regulatory network analysis was conducted, and drug prediction analysis was performed. Finally, the expression of key PRGs was verified via quantitative PCR. A total of 157 differentially expressed genes and 21 differentially expressed PRGs were screened. In addition, two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm and the random forest algorithm, with both genes demonstrating a high diagnostic value. RIPK2 and GADD45B were positively correlated with neutrophils. The ceRNA regulatory network included two mRNAs, eight microRNAs and 16 long noncoding RNAs and 10 drugs/molecular compounds were predicted. Finally, quantitative PCR results revealed that the expression of both RIPK2 and GADD45B was upregulated in the lipopolysaccharide-induced HL-1 cell injury model. In conclusion, the present study identified two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) associated with SCM; these findings may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for SCM."
41473481,Geographic shift of Japanese spotted fever and diagnostic overshadowing by COVID-19 testing: A genetically confirmed northernmost case.,2025,"Japanese spotted fever (JSF), caused by Rickettsia japonica, typically presents with fever, rash, and eschar. While endemic to western and southern Japan, recent cases have emerged in urban, non-endemic areas. A 49-year-old man developed fever after returning from a work assignment in Yamagata Prefecture, a historically non-endemic region. Despite no respiratory findings, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and was initially treated as COVID-19. His condition deteriorated into multiorgan dysfunction, requiring intensive care. Physical examination revealed a diffuse rash and an eschar on the lower leg. Rickettsial infection was suspected, and intravenous minocycline was initiated. Rickettsia japonica was later confirmed by PCR and serology. This case represents the northernmost genetically confirmed JSF in Japan and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, particularly when COVID-19 test results conflict with clinical findings."
41473019,Development of a Piezoelectric Immunosensor to Rapidly Measure Prohibitin‑1 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Sepsis and Other Serious Infectious Diseases.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and the leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly when an affected patient develops multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a serious complication defined as progressive and potentially irreversible dysfunction in two or more organ systems. Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that patient outcomes with sepsis would improve if the risk for MODS and mortality could be identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms. We present an approach leveraging quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology for rapid ( approximately 30 min) detection of prohibitin-1 (PHB1), a protein with pleiotropic biological function that dramatically increases in blood during the acute phase of an infection. The feasibility of detection and reproducible quantification of recombinant PHB1 in physiological buffered conditions is described. Sensitivity and detection limit for the third overtone (12.19 Hz mug(-1) mL and 59.06 ng/mL, respectively) were determined to be within the physiological range, highlighting the QCM-D immunosensor's potential for applied use in plasma samples. Importantly, there was strong concordance between PHB1 concentration curves generated using the QCM-D immunosensor and those from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which typically requires 36 h. Our findings illustrate a feasible and reproducible method to detect a bloodborne protein using immunosensor technology that has the potential to improve patient outcomes in sepsis and other serious infectious diseases."
41472947,Exogenous Insulin Antibody Syndrome and Subsequent Severe Subcutaneous Insulin Resistance Complicating Type 1 Diabetes.,2026,"A young girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) developed exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAS) characterized by daytime hyperglycemia and ketosis alternating with prolonged severe nocturnal hypoglycemia. EIAS was diagnosed after the exclusion of other causes of hypoglycemia and with confirmation of very high insulin autoantibody levels, high plasma levels of bound insulin, and abnormal insulin clearance. Treatment with different insulin analogues, subcutaneous (SC) insulin pump, immunomodulation using corticosteroids, and intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin were not effective. She responded well to B-lymphocyte depletive therapy (rituximab) with a fall in insulin antibody levels and returned to usual T1D management with a marked improvement in severity of hypoglycemia. One year later she developed hyperglycemia and ketosis and showed no glycemic effect from SC insulin. She became dependent on IV insulin and was diagnosed with severe subcutaneous insulin resistance (SIR). She managed IV insulin at home but developed episodes of sepsis and central line blockage. Many treatment strategies failed, but successful management was finally achieved with the addition of heparin to insulin lispro via SC pump. EIAS and SIR are both extremely rare and, in this case, responded to very different treatment approaches."
41472805,The role of gut microbiota in the onset and development of sepsis and its therapeutic potential: mechanisms and research progress.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease triggered by infection-induced immune dysregulation, characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, and is one of the leading causes of death among critically ill patients worldwide. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance plays a crucial role in the progression of sepsis. This review identifies the core mechanisms of GM imbalance: it disrupts the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, induces bacterial and endotoxin translocation, activates systemic inflammatory responses, and forms a vicious cycle of ""gut-organ"" cross-damage, becoming a key driver of sepsis-associated multi-organ dysfunction. Existing research has confirmed that microbiota modulation strategies, such as probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have potential therapeutic value. However, due to issues like strain specificity, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient clinical evidence, the clinical translation of these strategies still faces significant barriers. Therefore, future research should focus on the identification of sepsis-specific GM core functional biomarkers, the development of personalized combined regulatory strategies, and the advancement of targeted delivery technologies. Multi-center large-scale clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety, providing innovative solutions for precision treatment of sepsis."
41472734,Identification and validation of core biomarkers for sepsis: a comprehensive analysis using bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to infection, requires timely and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Despite advances in medical research, identifying reliable biomarkers for sepsis remains a challenge. This study aims to identify and validate key biomarkers for sepsis, addressing the limitations of current diagnostic methods like the SOFA score, PCT, and CRP, particularly in terms of specificity and early detection. METHODS: We recruited 23 sepsis patients and 10 healthy controls, collecting peripheral blood samples for mRNA sequencing. Public datasets (GSE134347, GSE167363, and GSE220189) were also utilized for differential gene expression analysis. The expression and functions of these biomarkers were systematically verified through GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network construction, ROC curve analysis, AUC values of machine-learning models, survival analysis, and immune cell subset localization analysis. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified four core biomarkers-CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163-as significantly differentially expressed in sepsis patients. ROC curve and AUC analyses of machine-learning models showed AUC values exceeding 0.9 for these biomarkers across seven models, indicating superior diagnostic performance. Survival analysis revealed significant associations of KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 with sepsis prognosis. Specifically, higher expression levels of RETN and CD163 were linked to increased mortality risk, whereas higher KLRB1 levels were associated with decreased mortality risk. Immune cell-specific expression localization showed CD27 expression in T cells, KLRB1 in NK cells, RETN in monocytes and neutrophils, and CD163 in monocytes, indicating a cell-type-based immune regulatory network. CONCLUSION: CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 form a dynamic immune network that reflects the pathological progression of sepsis from hyper-inflammatory to immunosuppressive phases. Monitoring the expression changes of these biomarkers can accurately assess patients' immune status and guide clinical interventions, such as anti-inflammatory or immunostimulatory therapies. This study offers new directions for early diagnosis and individualized treatment of sepsis."
41472702,Aggressive Chemotherapy and Antepartum Management of Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary of Hypercalcemic Type: A Novel Case Report with Ethical and Medical Decision-Making Consideration.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Small-cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, aggressive, and highly fatal gynecologic malignancy with few treatment guidelines offered in nonpregnant patients. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old woman presented for initial prenatal care at 9 weeks and her dating ultrasound was notable for a large complex adnexal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 weeks later revealed accelerated interval growth with possible malignant etiology. She underwent surgical evaluation with salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathology noted signature features of SCCOHT. The patient desired expectant management and declined termination of pregnancy or chemotherapy. Four weeks later, she developed severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and she was diagnosed with extensive metastatic disease. After multidisciplinary and multi-institutional counseling, she elected for continuation of her pregnancy and 6-agent chemotherapy including Vinblastine, Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Bleomycin, Doxorubicin, Etoposide (VPCBAE) with close antepartum surveillance. The patient completed multiple rounds of chemotherapy and subsequently delivered via primary cesarean at 27 (2/7) weeks due to maternal sepsis and nonreassuring fetal status. Maternal and neonatal death occurred approximately 1-week postpartum. CONCLUSION: This is the first known case of SCCOHT in which the pregnancy was continued through an aggressive chemotherapy regimen."
41472638,"Diagnostic Performance of Biomarkers Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, and Procalcitonin in Neonatal Sepsis: A Case-Control Study.",2025,"Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with diagnosis complicated by nonspecific clinical signs and limited reliability of conventional laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT) with traditional sepsis screening parameters in neonates. This hospital-based case-control study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a North Indian tertiary care medical university between September 2023 and March 2025. A total of 300 neonates were screened, of which 100 were diagnosed with sepsis (cases) and the remaining 200 served as controls. Sepsis screening, TNF-alpha, IL-6, PCT, and blood culture were performed to diagnose neonatal sepsis. Results of this study showed significantly higher levels of all tested biomarkers and sepsis parameters in cases compared with controls. Among biomarkers, TNF-alpha demonstrated the highest accuracy [area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.99, sensitivity 94%, specificity 100%], followed by PCT (AUROC 0.82, sensitivity 80%, specificity 82.5%) and IL-6 (AUROC 0.79, sensitivity 86%, specificity 74.5%). The study concludes that TNF-alpha is the most reliable biomarker for diagnosing neonatal sepsis, although a multimodal approach integrating conventional parameters with cytokines and PCT offers the best diagnostic yield. Combining early biomarkers with standard screening may improve early recognition, reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, and strengthen antimicrobial stewardship."
41472308,Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Effects of 7-Deaza-2-methyladenosine (7DMA) in a Susceptible Mouse Model of Usutu Virus Infection.,2025,"Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging arbovirus recently associated with outbreaks in Western Europe. Although USUV is typically associated with asymptomatic or nonspecific febrile disease, the occurrence of severe neuroinvasive forms of disease has raised concern. There is currently no antiviral treatment available for USUV infection; therefore, we sought to investigate the protective effects of the nucleoside analogue 7DMA against USUV. Adding to 7DMA's activity against USUV in vitro reported by us and others, we found that 7DMA inhibits USUV replication at multiple stages in mammalian cell lines Vero CCL81 and SH-SY5Y. In vivo testing of 7DMA using the susceptible IFNAR(-/-) mouse model indicated that 7DMA treatment significantly reduced USUV viremia and viral load in tissues and prolonged mice survival. The characterization of the protective effects of 7DMA indicated that treatment also altered immunological aspects of disease development, further increasing the expression of mediators such as CXCL10, IL-15, and IFN-gamma, and increasing neutrophil recruitment to target organs. We did not observe significant tissue damage or pathology in USUV-infected mouse brains, suggesting that systemic infection and disease are the major components leading to mortality in this model. We conclude that 7DMA exerts protective effects against USUV infection in the IFNAR(-/-) model."
41472286,"Differences in the Phenotype of Bacterial and Viral Sepsis-A Prospective, Multicenter, Observational Study.",2025,"Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to an infection, leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction. While sepsis is most commonly the result of a bacterial infection, it may also be caused by viral pathogens. The aim of this study was to describe differences in organ dysfunction patterns and inflammatory markers between bacterial and viral sepsis. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, adults meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria were recruited from four Austrian ICUs between 1 August 2021 and 1 April 2024, excluding those who were immunocompromised within the preceding 12 months. Ninety patients were enrolled, of whom 57 had bacterial and 33 viral sepsis. Inflammatory markers, including IL-6 and PCT, were higher at ICU admission in bacterial sepsis. Adjusted linear regression confirmed bacterial etiology as the only significant predictor of higher 48 h peak IL-6 and PCT values. Patients with viral sepsis typically fulfilled SEPSIS-3 criteria through respiratory and cardiovascular SOFA components, while other organ dysfunctions were less frequent. Significant differences in the phenotype of bacterial and viral sepsis were observed, characterized by distinct inflammatory profiles and differing patterns of organ dysfunction. These findings may support the improved differentiation of bacterial and viral etiologies in sepsis."

41472238,Pericarditis in a Child with COVID-19 Complicated by Streptococcus pneumoniae Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually mild, but in rare cases may lead to severe complications. Early recognition and comprehensive management are critical for favorable outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 2-year-old girl, previously healthy and unvaccinated against Streptococcus Pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute otitis media. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Antiviral and antibiotic treatment was initiated, but she remained febrile, polypneic, and tachycardic. The diagnosis of MIS-C was excluded; there was no involvement of two organs, and infection with S. pneumoniae serotype 19 F was identified. Given the unfavorable evolution, corticosteroid therapy and immunoglobulin were instituted, and subsequently, following the antibiogram result, antibiotic therapy was escalated to Meropenem and Linezolid. Clinical and laboratory parameters improved, but pericarditis with a small fluid slide and ECG changes were associated. The evolution was favorable with complete cardiac recovery at 30 days. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of vigilant assessment for secondary bacterial infections and cardiac complications in pediatric COVID-19. Prompt recognition and targeted treatment are essential, and pneumococcal vaccination remains a fundamental preventive measure. Moreover, the scarcity of literature documenting SARS-CoV-2 infections complicated by pericarditis further underscores the uniqueness of this case and its relevance for specialists in the field."
41472236,Evaluation of the Pathogenicity of Highly Virulent Eurasian Genotype II African Swine Fever Virus with MGF505-2R Gene Deletion in Piglets.,2025,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses a significant threat to the global pig industry due to high mortality rates and complex genetic variation. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) provide protection against ASFV. Previously, MGF505-2R was identified as a potent inhibitor of innate immunity in vitro. This study evaluates the pathogenicity of a recombinant Eurasian genotype II strain with the MGF505-2R gene deleted (ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R) in piglets. Twelve five-week-old crossbred piglets were divided into two groups, with one group of eight piglets inoculated with ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R (n = 8) and the other group of four piglets inoculated with the same dose of parental ASFV CN/GS 2018 (n = 4). Clinical symptoms, viral loads, and immune responses were monitored over 30 days. ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R-inoculated piglets exhibited transient fever and low viremia only in the beginning of the challenge, while the control group developed high levels of viremia and hyperthermia at day 2 and 8 post-challenge, respectively. Meanwhile, the control group demonstrated more severe post-mortem signs and immuno-histochemistry injury when compared to the DeltaMGF505-2R group. ELISA analysis displayed higher levels of IFN-beta and IL-1beta in the DeltaMGF505-2R group, further solidating the immunosuppressive role of MGF505-2R. All ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R-inoculated piglets developed high titers of ASFV-specific P30 antibodies at 10 days post-challenge. These findings rationalized the potential of ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R as a live attenuated candidate for ASF infection."
41472015,Non-Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)-Related Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).,2025,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although traditionally viewed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), can also result from non-sexually transmitted microorganisms that display distinct epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Unlike STI-related PID, these infections are less influenced by sexual behavior, often show a bimodal age distribution, and are linked to bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated dysbiosis, iatrogenic uterine procedures, postpartum states, or inadequate access to timely screening and care. Non-STI-related PID is usually polymicrobial, predominantly involving BV-associated vaginal, enteric, or urinary commensals that ascend into the upper genital tract, while respiratory tract organisms, mycobacteria, and biofilm-associated pathogens may also play a role. Pathophysiological mechanisms include disruption of the endocervical barrier, mucus degradation, biofilm formation, hematogenous or iatrogenic seeding, and chronic cytokine-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic/subclinical disease to acute pelvic pain and tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and can progress to systemic infection and sepsis. Diagnosing non-STI PID is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, negative STI tests, and inconclusive imaging findings, while management relies on broad-spectrum antimicrobials with surgery as needed. Given these complexities, this review aims to synthesize current knowledge on non-STI-related PID, clarify key considerations for its diagnosis, management, and prevention, and outline future perspectives to improve clinical outcomes."
41471193,"Retrospective Evaluation of the Incidence, Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Patients with hematologic malignancies are highly vulnerable to Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections (GNB-BSIs) due to underlying disease-related immunosuppression, intensive chemotherapy, and repeated invasive interventions, rendering these infections a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features of GNB-BSIs in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies, and to compare clinical and microbiological factors between survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary university hospital hematology ward in Turkiye, including adult patients diagnosed with BSIs due to Gram-negative bacteria between January 2005 and December 2024. Demographic characteristics, microbiological profiles, antimicrobial resistance rates, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. We compared survivors and non-survivors to determine differences in clinical and microbiological characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 321 patients with hematologic malignancies experienced 441 episodes of GNB-BSIs. The median age was 46 years, and 59% of them were male. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (53.3%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.6%) and Pseudomonas spp. (7.5%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (ESBL/3GCR) and carbapenem-resistant isolates were observed in 21.1% and 13.3% of isolates, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 26.5%. ICU admission, multidrug resistance, and persistent bacteremia were observed more often among non-survivors. Additionally, prolonged fever duration (median 8 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001), elevated CRP (p = 0.001), and higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.046) were detected in non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematologic malignancies, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. remain the predominant pathogens causing bloodstream infections, while persistent bacteremia, ESBL/3GCR, and carbapenem resistance are associated with higher mortality. Notably, carbapenem resistance showed a temporal increase over the study period, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance and timely adaptation of empirical treatment strategies."
41471177,"Epidemiology of Fungal Bloodstream Infections and Antifungal Susceptibility in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Rare Candida Co-Infection Case.",2025,"BACKGROUND: In Saudi Arabia, rising multi-drug-resistant (MDR) fungal infections from broad-spectrum antifungal overuse highlight the urgent need for epidemiological and susceptibility research. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed fungal isolates from 55 patients with positive blood cultures in a Riyadh tertiary hospital, with identification and antifungal susceptibility tested via the VITEK-2 compact system. RESULTS: Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida (NAC) were isolated from 11 and 38 patients, respectively. In the NAC group, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis spp. were predominant. C. glabrata exhibited the highest resistance to antifungals. Increased rates of resistance were shown by fluconazole and itraconazole, whereas voriconazole was the most effective azole with the lowest resistance. No evidence of resistance was found against non-azole antifungals. A single case of triple resistance to ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole was observed in C. parapsilosis. A single isolate of C. albicans was resistant to all tested azoles. A rare instance of coinfection with C. glabrata and C. albicans was identified in a single male patient with a dual-resistance pattern against posaconazole and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of NAC, including tolerant isolates of C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata, along with multi-azole-resistant C. albicans and unique coinfection scenarios, urgently requires robust antifungal resistance surveillance."
41470207,Prognostic Factors for Mortality in Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections Among Hemodialysis Patients: A Prospective Single-Center Study.,2025,"Background and Objectives: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a major life-threatening complication among patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) through central venous catheters. This study was performed to determine mortality risk factors in HD patients with CRBSI. Materials and Methods: Data were collected prospectively from patients with CRBSI using central venous catheters as HD access between November 2022 and November 2023. A total of 60 patients were evaluated with respect to age, sex, catheter dwell time, insertion site, comorbidities, and a range of clinical findings. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Risk factors were assessed through univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: The median age of the patients was 63 years, and 56.9% were male. The in-hospital mortality rate among the HD patients with CRBSI was 15%. Gram-positive microorganisms were responsible for 55.6% of the cases resulting in mortality. The following factors were associated with mortality: multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, the presence of a non-tunneled catheter, concomitant pyocystitis, elevated C-reactive protein, qSOFA >/= 2, and altered consciousness. In multivariate logistic regression, MDR microorganisms, concomitant pyocystitis, and qSOFA >/= 2 remained significant independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: Our findings show that the above factors may be useful in predicting mortality in HD patients with CRBSI. Awareness of these factors and prompt intervention can help reduce mortality."
41469754,Immune cell profiling supports early prediction of sepsis-associated acute kidney disease using a decision tree algorithm.,2025,"Sepsis is a major cause of acute kidney injury, progressing to sepsis-associated acute kidney disease (SA-AKD). This study explores SA-AKD prediction by combining immune cell profiling. Peripheral immune cell expression and phenotypes were analyzed in sepsis patients without (n = 97) and with (n = 41) SA-AKD, admitted to a hospital (2020-2022). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were measured, and a decision tree (DT)-based model was used to evaluate their predictive power in the training (n = 106) and validation (n = 32) cohorts. The DT model, incorporating naive Treg and CD56(dim) NK cells along with clinical parameters, showed high accuracy in predicting SA-AKD. The model using blood urea nitrogen as the first node reached 89.62% accuracy (sensitivity: 94.4% and specificity: 87.14%; area under the curve = 0.91). The model starting with creatinine showed 89.62% accuracy. Validation results confirmed an 81.25% accuracy. Profiling specific immune cells may enable pre-evaluation of SA-AKD."
41469732,Improving blood culture procurement: a prospective 5-year hospital-wide study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Appropriate procurement of blood cultures (BC) is essential for diagnosis of bacteremia and susceptibility testing. This includes (1) adequate preparation of the venipuncture site to minimize contamination; (2) obtaining >/= two sets with a time interval before starting antibiotics. Although these recommendations are standard since the 1960s, adherence is far less than expected - which may adversely impact on the management of bacteremic patients. AIMS OF STUDY: This single-center study conducted in Shaare Zedek Medical Center aimed to decrease the proportion of contaminated BCs and to increase the percentage of obtaining two sets of BC/ blood-culture-taking episode. METHODS: Determination of both markers at baseline, then monthly for one year, then subsequently on a quarterly basis; showing data from all departments in real-time to all department directors; and providing short educative lectures during departmental staff meetings, at baseline and after 1-2 years. These markers were adopted as one of the hospital-wide quality measures. RESULTS: In the 20-year period 2000-2019 more than 1 million BCs were obtained, of which 70% were from patients </= 72 h in hospital. During the 5-year study (2020-2024), the percent of blood-culture-taking episodes from which two culture sets were obtained increased annually by +/- 16% from a baseline of 27% (9010/33306) in 2020, to 46% (18462/40191) in 2024 (Incidence Rate Ratios, IRR 1.16 [95%CI 1.13-1.18], p < 0.001). This improvement was observed in almost all departments and was especially profound in the emergency department (ED), starting at a baseline of 19% (1979/10326) and increasing to 53% (5304/9915)(IRR 1.33 [95%CI 1.27-1.39], p < 0.001). During the same period, the annual proportion of false-positive BCs, from which only contaminants were isolated, decreased annually by 18% from 2.4% (1592/65230) in 2020 to 1.3% (895/68991) in 2024 (IRR 0.82 [95%CI 0.77-0.88], p < 0.001). This improvement was observed in all departments: in the emergency department, this rate decreased from 3.3% (676/20529) to 1.56% (272/17459) (IRR 0.79 [95%CI 0.75-0.83], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A simple educational intervention, combined with meticulous data mining and presentation of each department's results, with comparison of all other departments, led to significant and sustained improvement in measurable markers."
41469631,Plasma presepsin as a predictor of mortality in patients with UTI-related severe infection: a single-center retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether plasma presepsin levels are a more reliable predictor of mortality than traditional infection biomarkers in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI)-related severe infection. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated 69 patients with UTI-related severe infection admitted to the emergency department between May 2022 and August 2023. Data on vital signs, plasma presepsin levels, procalcitonin (PCT) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and other laboratory values at admission were collected. The values of presepsin, PCT, CRP, and WBC count for predicting 28-day mortality were analyzed. Survivors and non-survivors were propensity score-matched in a 2:1 ratio based on age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, presepsin showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.716 for predicting 28-day mortality, surpassing that of PCT (0.641), CRP (0.488), and WBC count (0.433). Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk (hazard ratio, 1.026; p = 0.008). In the matched cohort, presepsin levels showed the highest AUROC (0.660), followed by PCT (0.584), CRP (0.496), and WBC count (0.436). CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk; this may be a valuable biomarker for identifying high-risk patients with UTI-related severe infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric ALL patients (n = 146), residing in RCT of Ukraine, were the study subjects within a survey period of 15 years. The ALL diagnosis and distribution of patients by the disease variants were heldaccording to the FAB classification and results of immunophenotyping of the bone marrow blast cells. Chemotherapy(CT) was prescribed according to the BerlinFrankfurtMunster group (BFM) protocols. Patients were examined afterthe remission induction therapy. Incidence and type of the bacterial fungal and toxic complications were assessed.The number of deaths was taken into account depending on the age, ALL variant and serum ferritin (SF) content.Radiation doses to the bone marrow were calculated for the entire period of stay in RCT after the accident.Processing of the obtained materials was carried out using the mathematical statistical methods (Student's andSpearman's correlation coefficients, chi2 Pearson test). RESULTS: Study subjects were distributed according to the ALL variants, namely proB (n = 21, 14.4 %), <<general>>type (n = 97, 66.4 %), preB (n = 12, 8.2 %), and TALL (n = 16, 11.0 %). Three groups were formed taking intoaccount the SF levels: Group I (n = 53) - SF up to 200 ng/ml, Group II (n = 49) - SF from 200 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml,Group III (n = 44) - SF above 500 ng/ml. The blood hemoglobin level and RBC count were decreased along theincrease in SF content (p < 0.05). A direct correlation was found between the SF content and RBC average volume(r = 0.45; small er, Cyrillic < 0.05). Anemia was of a normocytic type. The lowest number of cases with iron overload was among thechildren with preBHLL disease variant (1 out of 12). An inverse correlation was established between the transferrin concentration and average hemoglobin content in RBC (r = 0.6; small er, Cyrillic < 0.05). Sepsis and infections of the anal areawere more often observed in the patients with SF level above 200 ng/ml. The course of pneumonia was complicated in case of SF level above 500 ng/ml. The oral cavity and intestinal mucositis did not depend on SF level.Incidence of the systemic toxic effects after chemotherapy was increased under SF level above 500 ng/ml. The number of deaths in children with SF levels above 500 ng/ml was almost doubled. Most of the deaths occurred in thepatients with proBALL (15 out of 21) and TALL (8 out of 16) disease variants. Fewer children had died having the<<common>> ALL type (14 out of 97, 14.4 %). The number of deaths in case of preBALL variant not depended on SF levels. The <<common>> type and TALL patients having got iron overload died more often. The average radiationdoses to the bone marrow were (4.9 +/- 0.4) mSv and did not affect the remaining parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Iron excess in the body affects the incidence and type of infectious complications both with the outcome of ALL in children, which requires timely diagnosis and preventive measures."
41469172,Endoscopic use of a biodegradable biliary stent in the management of a complex bile duct injury.,2025,"A man in his 50s sustained a Strasberg type D bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was initially misdiagnosed as a minor bile leak. Upon referral, he presented with abdominal pain, sepsis and a large biloma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with plastic stent placement and percutaneous drainage resolved the leak, but a severe stricture of the common hepatic duct persisted. A biodegradable polydioxanone-based biliary stent was subsequently deployed, resulting in complete stricture resolution and improved ductal patency at 6-month follow-up, with no complications. This case illustrates the potential role of biodegradable stents in managing complex biliary injuries."
41468900,Septic Synovitis and Osteomyelitis in Foals: Current Situation in a French Referral Hospital and Value of Computed Tomography for Diagnosis and Treatment.,2025,"To describe cases of septic synovitis and osteomyelitis in foals younger than 6 months presented to a single hospital and their management and to report the value of computed tomography in diagnosis and management of these cases.This is a retrospective descriptive study.Sixty-five foals were included in this study. Forty-six foals (71%) survived to discharge. The presence of osteomyelitis (p = 0.16), umbilical infection (p = 0.41), or infection with Rhodococcus equi (p = 1) did not significantly influence survival. However, risk of nonsurvival was significantly increased if multiple sites were infected (p = 0.007; odds ratio [OR] = 5.80) or when bony lesions were present on admission radiographs (p = 0.03; OR = 3.47). A large proportion of the foals in this study had osteomyelitis (66%; 43/65). Computed tomography use was not significantly associated with survival (p = 0.27) but allowed identification of osteomyelitis lesions in 16 out of 43 cases (37.2%) where radiological findings were unremarkable.This study reports a high frequency of osteomyelitis in foals in multiple different regions of the skeleton, with or without associated synovial sepsis. The prognosis, defined as survival to discharge, for these orthopaedic infections is positive, especially if only one location is affected. Computed tomography scan allows an early diagnosis as well as detection of radiographically silent lesions and is an interesting tool in targeted treatments of these foals. Gram-positive bacterial infections were overrepresented in this study, suggesting some similarities with human paediatric orthopaedic infections."
41468640,Construction and validation of a machine learning-based risk prediction model for invasive mechanical ventilation in AECOPD patients complicated with respiratory failure.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to create and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) complicated by respiratory failure. METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with AECOPD and respiratory failure were retrospectively extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). A total of 551 cases were split 7:3 into a training set (385 cases) for model construction and an internal validation set (166 cases). The IMV served as the outcome event. Features were selected with the Boruta algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Eight ML algorithms-XGBoost, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), LightGBM, CatBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (NN)-were trained with 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. An external validation cohort of 100 AECOPD-respiratory failure patients admitted to Baoying People's Hospital between January 2020 and August 2025 was collected. The final best model was interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to clarify feature importance and decision logic, and an interactive dynamic nomogram was plotted to increase readability. RESULTS: Boruta plus LASSO identified total calcium, partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and sepsis as significant predictors. XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an internal validation accuracy of 72.2%, sensitivity of 64.6%, specificity of 79.8 %, F1 score of 69.7% and AUC of 0.813 (95% CI 0.748-0.878). The external validation accuracy reached 76.4%, the sensitivity reached 82.6%, the specificity reached 70.0%, the F1 score reached 78.7%, and the AUC reached 0.840 (95% CI 0.801-0.879). SHAP analysis further indicated that PO(2) and SpO(2) were the primary drivers of model decisions. An interactive dynamic nomogram was successfully constructed. CONCLUSION: IMV in AECOPD patients with respiratory failure was associated with total calcium, PO(2), and SpO(2) levels and sepsis. The developed XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive value for IMV in this clinical population."
41467899,Dengue Infection in Pediatric Patients With Malignancies: A Single-center Retrospective Study.,2026,"Dengue infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile neutropenia in endemic areas, even in the absence of warning signs. A retrospective audit was done on medical records of patients (age 14 y or younger) who were diagnosed with dengue fever from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 in a tertiary care cancer center. Patients fulfilling the WHO 2009 criteria of dengue fever and confirmation with detection of either IgM or NS1 were included. Data regarding symptomatology, clinical course, laboratory values, and outcome were analyzed. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with dengue. Primary malignancy was mainly B-ALL (n=16; 69%). Thirteen patients (56.6%) had criteria fulfilling dengue without warning signs, 5 (21.7%) had dengue with warning signs, and 5 (21.7%) had severe dengue. All patients were treated as inpatients with intravenous fluids and supportive care. Five patients (21.7%) with shock required IVF at 10 mL/kg/h. Two patients (8%) had blood culture positivity and were managed based on the susceptibility pattern. Median delay in chemotherapy was 6 days. The mean duration of hospital stay was 7 days. Three patients (13%) had features of HLH. One patient succumbed to multiorgan failure (with HLH and MDR Klebsiella sepsis)."
41467150,Bilateral Adrenal Hemorrhage and Acute Adrenal Insufficiency Secondary to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Adrenal insufficiency (AI) secondary to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is rare; only 3 instances of such cases were reported after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). We report a case of AI due to BAH from HIT after an elective CABG. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease underwent CABG a week ago presented with abdominal pain. Labs showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap, and positive serum ketones. Intravenous insulin with empirical antibiotics was started. Platelet decline was noticed from 154 000/uL to 39 000/uL on the following days, along with fever, hypotension, altered mentation, hyponatremia, and abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed BAH. Primary AI was confirmed with a cosyntropin stimulation test, and HIT was diagnosed with Heparin-PF4 IgG assay and serotonin release assay. His symptoms improved after hydrocortisone treatment. DISCUSSION: AI secondary to BAH from HIT is a rare complication, with most cases reported after orthopedic surgeries. Symptoms of AI are vague and similar to sepsis. If hyponatremia, and gastrointestinal symptoms are noticed, adrenal insufficiency should be suspected, and early stress dose steroid treatment should be considered. Steroid treatment in such cases has shown to improve survival. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and could be similar to sepsis. Electrolyte abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms could be hints for adrenal insufficiency, especially if risks for adrenal hemorrhage are present. Early stress dose treatment in such cases has shown a survival benefit."
41466958,Immunosuppression Masking a Urological Emergency: A Case Report of Bilateral Infected Obstructed Kidneys.,2025,"An infected obstructed kidney is a urological emergency with the potential to cause life-threatening sepsis. It is often due to ureteric calculi and requires urgent decompression by ureteric stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. We present a patient who presented with bilateral obstructed kidneys secondary to ureteric stones while on immunosuppressive therapy. A middle‑aged woman with prior bilateral lung transplants on tacrolimus and prednisolone presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Clinical examination was unremarkable, and blood tests showed normal inflammatory markers and renal function. CT imaging revealed a 6 mm right distal ureteric calculus and a 4 mm left vesicoureteric junction calculus with subtle obstructive features. Despite atypical findings, urological intervention was pursued, given ongoing sepsis and absence of alternative pathology. The patient underwent bilateral ureteric stenting and was admitted to intensive care, recovered well, and was discharged. Elective ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy achieved stone clearance six weeks later, with no recurrence at six‑month follow‑up. She has been discharged from urology follow-up. The case underscores the challenges in diagnosis and management of immunosuppressed patients, where atypical clinical presentations may cause diagnostic uncertainties. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential to achieve optimal outcomes in such complex scenarios."
41466902,Klebsiella aerogenes Causing Mitral Valve Infective Endocarditis With Multiple Septic Emboli to the Brain: A Case Report.,2025,"Klebsiella aerogenes is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, it can occasionally cause bloodstream infections and, rarely, infective endocarditis (IE). Severe complications related to K. aerogenes bloodstream infections, such as systemic embolization, have been described in the literature. In this report, we describe a case of K. aerogenes IE in an elderly male patient who initially presented to urgent care with a UTI. He had been diagnosed and prescribed a course of oral antibiotics; however, the treatment failed due to antimicrobial resistance. This led to the development of bacteremia and sepsis requiring hospital admission. He later developed endocarditis as confirmed by echocardiography, which was complicated by mitral regurgitation, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic central nervous system (CNS) strokes. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and assessed by cardiac surgery, though operative management was deferred until his overall condition improved. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely management of IE in patients with persistent Klebsiella bacteremia unresponsive to initial therapy, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach to achieve optimal outcomes, especially when dealing with such rare causative organisms."
41466668,Acute kidney injury in chronic liver disease: Causes and prevalence in a cross-sectional study.,2025,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a prevalent condition with significant systemic complications and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication that worsens prognosis. This prospective observational study, conducted from November 2019 to June 2021 at G.R. Medical College, Gwalior, included 100 CLD patients. The study found that 30% of patients developed AKI, with sepsis as the most common precipitating factor. Severe renal impairment (Stage 3 AKI) was present in 46.6% of AKI cases. Alcohol was the leading etiology of CLD and the timely diagnosis and management of AKI in CLD patients are essential to improving outcomes and reducing mortality."
41466471,Alactic base excess as an early predictor of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early detection and intervention are essential for improving clinical outcomes. This study investigates the predictive utility of alactic base excess (ABE) as an early biomarker for SA-AKI within the first 24 h of hospital or emergency department admission. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India from May 2022 to April 2023. Adult patients (>/= 18 years) diagnosed with sepsis at hospital/emergency/intensive care unit (ICU) admission were enrolled. ABE was calculated at 0, 12, and 24 h after admission to hospital or emergency department by adjusting standard base excess for serum lactate levels. The primary outcome was the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Secondary outcomes included AKI severity, stratification by ABE ranges, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 369 enrolled patients, 159 (43%) developed AKI, and 66 (17.9%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Baseline ABE remained a significant independent predictor, with each 1 mmol/L increase (less negative value) associated with an 11% reduction in AKI risk (adjusted OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, p = 0.030). More negative baseline ABE values were significantly associated with both increased AKI incidence and mortality. ABE measurements at 12 and 24 h were not independently predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ABE is a cost-effective, easily obtainable biomarker that independently associates with SA-AKI and correlates with in-hospital mortality. Its early use in sepsis management may improve risk stratification and outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Multicenter validation is recommended. Trial registration number The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/07/044168), dated 20/07/2022."
41466195,Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) as a predictor of multiple organ dysfunction in pediatric critical care: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: RBC distribution width is a key variable in complete blood counts, associated with immature RBC release into circulation due to various processes, including systemic inflammation. RDW correlates with elevated acute inflammatory markers like ESR, CRP, and interleukin-6, and is a biomarker in conditions like kidney disease and multiple myelomas. It independently predicts disease severity in critically ill adults and is associated with morbidity, mortality and length of stay in pediatric intensive care unit, though its potential as an early biomarker for detecting pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) remains unknown. METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed PICU patients admitted to Aga Khan University Hospital from September 2018 to December 2022, excluding those admitted for less than 48 h for elective procedures, received recent RBC transfusions, or were anemic. RDW > 14.0% was considered elevated. MODS, defined as dysfunction in two or more organs, was the primary outcome. Data included demographics, PRISM III scores, laboratory values (RDW, BUN, creatinine, CRP, etc.), and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified into three RDW groups: <13.4%, 13.4-14.3%, and > 14.4%. Analysis focused on associations between RDW levels and MODS within the first 7 days of PICU admission. RESULTS: The study included 680 patients. Higher RDW was associated with younger age and higher PRISM III scores, but not with sex. RDW Group III had longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and higher incidence of MODS, but not significant. Hemoglobin and MCHC levels were lower in Group III, whereas BUN and creatinine levels showed no significant differences across groups. The OR for MODS was highest for Group II. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study evaluated the prognostic value of RDW in predicting length of stay, mortality, and early identification of MODS within seven days. Among 680 pediatric patients, higher RDW levels were associated with increased mortality, longer LOS, and higher rates of sepsis and MODS, though these findings lacked statistical significance. Elevated RDW was linked to inflammation and critical illness severity but did not correlate well with pediatric severity scores or MODS trends. Future multicenter studies are recommended to explore RDW's utility in predicting early organ dysfunction and critical illness outcomes."
41465881,Longitudinal Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Trajectories in Preterm Infants with Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS), defined as systemic infection occurring within the first 72 hours of life, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Increasing evidence indicates that the gut may play an active role in systemic inflammation, yet the temporal behavior of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during EONS has not been characterized. SCFAs and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are key microbial metabolites involved in epithelial maturation and immune regulation and may provide a non-invasive window into early inflammatory vulnerability. METHODS: This pilot prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolled 49 preterm infants (</=32 weeks' gestation) originally identified as at high risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and subsequently stratified into EONS and non-sepsis groups. Serial stool samples were collected at predefined timepoints (TPs; TP1  approximately  3 days of life [DoL], TP2  approximately  7 DoL, TP3  approximately  14 DoL, TP4  approximately  21 DoL, and TP5  approximately  28 DoL). Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify a panel of 12 SCFAs, including BCFAs and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Both absolute concentrations and relative fractions were evaluated, with emphasis on ratio-based metrics (e.g., acetic/propionic acid ratio) and timepoint-specific group contrasts, complemented by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: At the earliest sampling window (TP1), infants with EONS exhibited distinct early changes in SCFA composition, including a significantly lower median relative fraction of acetic acid (86.6% vs. 94.5% in non-sepsis), while several non-acetate components-including propionic, valeric, and branched-chain acids-were relatively enriched. Acetate-to-non-acetate ratios were markedly reduced in EONS (e.g., acetic/propionic and acetic/isobutyric ratios), indicating an early shift away from acetate dominance. PLS-DA at TP1 demonstrated partial separation between groups, with acetic-acid depletion and non-acetate enrichment among the strongest contributors to discrimination. By later TPs, these early differences narrowed to a small subset of BCFA-related ratios and largely attenuated by the end of the first month. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot cohort of preterm infants, EONS was associated with early, structured alterations in fecal SCFA profiles, characterized by reduced acetic-acid dominance and relative enrichment of non-acetate acids. Dynamic, ratio-based assessment proved more informative than absolute concentrations alone, revealing transient intestinal metabolic signatures accompanying systemic infection. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence of gut metabolic involvement in EONS and lay the groundwork for larger, multi-center studies integrating SCFA trajectories with microbiome and immune profiling to refine early risk stratification for systemic infection in high-risk neonatal populations."
41465803,Laparoscopic Management of Boerhaave Syndrome: Case Series and Narrative Review.,2025,"Boerhaave syndrome, or spontaneous rupture of the esophageal wall, is a rare condition that occurs after a violent increase in intraesophageal pressure associated with negative intrathoracic pressure after forceful vomiting or retching. Rupture, usually transmural, often occurs in the distal esophagus and can be complicated by mediastinitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction. Despite the aid of imaging in diagnosis and rapid management, it is still characterized by a high mortality rate. Surgical and endoscopic approaches are the mainstays of treatment. Case presentation: Here, we describe three cases of Boerhaave's syndrome managed with minimally invasive surgical treatment and provide a brief literature review of the treatment methods for this rare condition. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and prompt management by a multidisciplinary team increase the chances of survival. The laparoscopic approach is beneficial and can successfully treat esophageal tears associated with this syndrome in early or delayed timing."
41464553,Prognostic Value of 48-h Biomarker Changes in Sepsis Mortality.,2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Although various scoring systems and biomarkers have been studied, the prognostic significance of early dynamic changes in laboratory parameters remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of 48 h changes in routinely monitored biomarkers for in-hospital mortality in septic patients. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted in the Anesthesiology and Reanimation ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital. A total of 174 adult patients (>/=18 years) diagnosed with sepsis according to SEPSIS-3 criteria between January 2017 and December 2022 were included. Laboratory data were recorded at ICU admission and after 48 h. Patients who died within 48 h or had missing follow-up data were excluded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression models were used to assess the prognostic performance of clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: The median age was 71 years, and 58% of patients were male. Comorbidities were present in 76% patients, and malignancy was associated with higher mortality (p = 0.012). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 58.6%. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy significantly increased mortality risk (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had higher baseline SOFA and APACHE II scores. At 48 h, mortality was associated with increased procalcitonin, lactate, and CRP/albumin ratio and greater albumin decline. ROC analysis identified procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, albumin > 7% decrease, and CRP/albumin ratio > 31% increase as optimal cutoffs. Multivariate analysis revealed SOFA score > 6, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, and platelet > 37% decrease as independent mortality predictors. The change in albumin level was included in the model but was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Forty-eight-hour biomarker changes, particularly in lactate and platelet count, may provide complementary prognostic information to baseline SOFA scores and may support early risk stratification in sepsis. These findings should be considered exploratory and require confirmation in prospective multicenter studies before clinical implementation."
41463121,Proteomics Reveals Differential Diagnosis Biomarkers Between Sepsis and Hemophagocytic Syndrome.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) shares many clinical features with sepsis. To improve HLH diagnosis and its differential diagnosis with sepsis, serum proteomic analyses of healthy donors, HLH and septic patients were performed. Methods: Twenty-four individuals were enrolled in a label-free MS/MS spectrometry analysis. STRING was conducted to study the protein-protein interactions overrepresented within the proteins of each comparison. To integrate the functions of the proteins with their respective regulation patterns, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used. Validation of selected proteins was carried out by ELISA. Results: Proteomic results revealed 537 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between HLH and sepsis, 471 DEPs between HLH and healthy donors, and 37 DEPs between sepsis and healthy donors. These results were subjected to functional analysis, which showed that apart from inflammation and lipid metabolism, the proteostasis network was deeply impaired in the HLH condition. Considering this information, protein fold changes and the functions of six proteins were validated by ELISA. Conclusions: sCD300a, sCD300b and sCD25 could be specific serum biomarkers for HLH diagnosis, and SAA-1 and LRG1 might be useful biomarkers for differential diagnosis between sepsis and HLH. PSMB1, a non-catalytic subunit of the 20S proteasome, showed promising results for HLH-specific and differential diagnosis. Its elevation in HLH patients may reflect an intensified demand for protein turnover, possibly driven by a higher activation of the immunoproteasome. These insights contribute to expanding our understanding of HLH pathophysiology regarding new pathways and highlight innovative therapeutic interventions, such as Bortezomib and other next-generation inhibitors, designed to modulate immunoproteasome activity."
41462865,Quantification of the Actin-Binding Protein Flightless-I in Human Serum by Automated Western Blot System and Investigation of Its Diagnostic Potential in Sepsis.,2025,"Background: The actin-binding protein Flightless-I (Flii) has not been quantified in the human serum yet. We aimed to determine serum Flii levels in healthy individuals and to investigate Flii as a potential marker in patients with sepsis focusing on diagnosis, organ failures, and short-term mortality. Methods: A total of 30 controls and 64 septic and 22 non-septic patients were enrolled in this follow-up study. Serum Flii levels were quantified by using the capillary electrophoresis-based Simple Western system with chemiluminescent detection. The assay was calibrated by applying dilution series of a purified recombinant human Flii standard and a parallel internal standard. Results: Flii levels of healthy controls were found between 3.5 and 8.8 mg/L, while septic and non-septic patients showed significantly lower values (p < 0.001). First-day Flii could differentiate sepsis from the non-septic inflammatory state (AUC: 0.667; p < 0.05) and indicated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among septic patients (AUC: 0.686; p < 0.05). Furthermore, a combination of Flii and other sepsis markers seemed to offer an improved diagnostic performance (sepsis vs. non-sepsis, AUC of Flii + gelsolin (GSN) + Gc-globulin + procalcitonin: 0.974; p < 0.001 and ARDS vs. non-ARDS, AUC of Flii + GSN + presepsin: 0.776; p < 0.001) compared with single markers even in the prediction of 14-day mortality (AUC of Flii + GSN + Gc-globulin: 0.76; p < 0.001). Conclusions: We adapted a properly precise and reproducible automated Western blot method to determine concentrations of Flii in human serum. Our results revealed the relationship between Flii and sepsis; however, Flii alone did not appear to be a prominent sepsis marker. When combined with other biomarkers, measurement of serum Flightless-I may provide additional value supporting patient care."
41462719,"Predictive Value of CRIB II Score, Hematological Markers and Maternal-Fetal Risk Factors for Mortality in Neonatal Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Accurate early prediction of mortality is essential to improve clinical outcomes. The Clinical Risk Index for Babies II (CRIB II) and hematological indices such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have emerged as potential prognostic tools, but their performance in septic neonates has not been fully established. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 80 neonates diagnosed with sepsis at a tertiary referral hospital. Demographic, maternal, and laboratory data-including CRIB II, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), PLR, mean platelet volume (MPV), and red-cell distribution width (RDW)-were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine optimal cutoff values, and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Among the 80 neonates, 40 (50%) did not survive. Non-survivors had significantly higher CRIB II scores (median 5.0 [1.0-13.0]) than survivors (2.0 [0-7.0]) (p < 0.001). PLR and MPV were also elevated in non-survivors (PLR: 88.5 vs. 51.8, p < 0.001; MPV: 10.5 vs. 9.5, p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for mortality: CRIB II (AUC = 0.835; cutoff > 3.5; sensitivity 82.5%; specificity 78.0%) and PLR (AUC = 0.757; cutoff > 81.33; sensitivity 80.0%; specificity 70.0%). Multivariate analysis confirmed three independent predictors-PROM > 24 h (OR = 12.23; 95% CI: 2.05-73.11), PLR > 81.33 (OR = 91.02; 95% CI: 7.00-1184.29), and CRIB II > 3.5 (OR = 101.37; 95% CI: 4.50-2284.47). CONCLUSIONS: CRIB II and PLR are reliable, independent predictors of mortality in neonatal sepsis. Their integration with maternal factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes may improve early risk stratification and guide targeted interventions, particularly in resource-limited neonatal care settings."
41462702,Hydralazine Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Murine Myocardial Dysfunction by Inhibition of Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a fatal complication with limited therapeutic options. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) contributes to oxidative stress and leukocyte recruitment, yet its role in SIMD remains unexplored. This study investigates whether hydralazine, a potent SSAO inhibitor, protects against SIMD by evaluating the involvement of SSAO inhibition. Using a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis, hydralazine was administered 30 min post-injection. Over a 7-day observation period, survival rates, cardiac function (assessed by echocardiography), and myocardial injury (evaluated via plasma biomarkers including CK, CK-MB, LDH, and AST, alongside histopathology) were monitored. Additional analyses included measurements of oxidative stress markers (T-AOC, GSH-PX, SOD, MDA, GSH), inflammatory chemokine levels using a Luminex panel, and myocardial SSAO activity via HPLC. The results demonstrated that hydralazine at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly improved 7-day survival rates from 20% to 90% and enhanced cardiac function in septic mice. It also reduced myocardial injury and histological damage while attenuating systemic inflammation through suppression of chemokine elevation. Furthermore, hydralazine boosted systemic and myocardial antioxidant capacity and normalized the sepsis-induced increase in myocardial SSAO activity, suggesting a potential mechanism for its protective effects. In conclusion, hydralazine shows robust cardioprotection in experimental sepsis by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cell infiltration. The inhibition of SSAO activity may be a pivotal underlying molecular mechanism."
41462176,Maternal mortality in Ethiopia (2015-2025): a systematic review of recent evidence and determinants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Despite major policy reforms and improvements in healthcare coverage, maternal mortality remains a critical public health burden in Ethiopia. While progress has been made since the Millennium Development Goals era, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) still exceeds national and global targets. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from the past decade (2015-2025) to describe the magnitude, determinants, and regional disparities of maternal mortality in Ethiopia, highlighting persistent challenges and future priorities. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)), we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and African Journal Online(AJOL), supplemented with grey literature from World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health. Studies published in English between January 2015 and September 2025 was included. Data extraction followed standardized templates, and study quality was appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tools. Given methodological heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis approach was applied. RESULTS: A total of 61 studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing all Ethiopian regions. The pooled MMR was estimated at 366.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, showing only modest progress from previous decades. The leading causes of maternal death were obstetric hemorrhage (29.6%), hypertensive disorders (22.1%), sepsis (14.8%), obstructed labor (11.3%), and unsafe abortion (8.5%). Determinants aligned with the three-delay model: (1) delayed decision-making from low awareness and sociocultural barriers; (2) delayed access due to distance, transport, and cost; and (3) delayed care from health-system shortages and weak referral mechanisms. Socioeconomic inequality, inadequate antenatal care (< 4 visits), rural residence, and low maternal education consistently increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality in Ethiopia remains unacceptably high yet preventable. Persistent inequities, poor service quality, and health-system gaps continue to drive maternal deaths. Despite national initiatives such as the Health Sector Transformation Plan II (2015-2025) and the Maternal and Child Health Roadmap, progress is uneven. Achieving the SDG 3.1 target of < 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 demands stronger referral systems, equitable resource distribution, and quality-focused maternal health interventions. Targeted regional interventions and stronger Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) readiness are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3.1 target. Future research should integrate longitudinal, spatial, machine learning and Bayesian models to pinpoint high-risk areas and evaluate the impact of health-system reforms."
41462123,High-density lipoprotein 2b combined with sequential organ failure assessment score as a novel prognostic indicator for sepsis patients: a prospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a state of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to consecutive organ failure and lethal outcome. The purpose of this study is to assess the value of the combined use of plasma high-density lipoprotein 2b (HDL2b) level and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in predicting short-term mortality from sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in patients with sepsis and non-septic controls admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) from January 2020 to December 2021. SOFA scores were recorded on the first day after admission. Blood samples were collected from each enrolled patient and the levels of HDL2b were analyzed using microfluidic chip technology. Receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were conducted to determine the values of plasma HDL2b level, SOFA score and the combined HDL2b levels and SOFA score (HDL2b + SOFA) in predicting the prognosis of mortality, respectively. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcome was total in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Compared to non-septic controls, patients with sepsis had lower HDL2b levels (10.95% [8.95, 12.96] vs. 23.78% [14.53, 29.16], p < 0.001). Among sepsis patients, the levels of HDL2b of non-survivors were lower than those of survivors (6.74% [4.63, 8.08] vs. 11.78 [7.20, 13.40], p = 0.002). Moreover, our data also indicated that patients with higher HDL2b + SOFA scores shown higher rates of 28-day and total in-hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC curves for predicting 28-day mortality were 0.755 for HDL2b, 0.782 for SOFA, and 0.806 for HDL2b + SOFA. Multivariate analyses indicated that HDL2b + SOFA (Odd Ratio: 1.321 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.028-1.698), p = 0.029) was potential predictors of 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The HDL2b + SOFA composite score was a reliable predictor of 28-day and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients, showing better discriminatory ability than SOFA alone."
41462112,Monitoring immune cell dynamics for potential prognostic biomarker of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host immune responses. This study investigates dynamic changes in immune cells during sepsis progression and evaluates their utility as predictive biomarkers for sepsis prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, immune cells from 220 patients with sepsis were compared with those of 70 healthy controls. Patients with sepsis were stratified by 28-day outcome into survivors (n = 148) and non-survivors (n = 72). Immune cells included the counts and percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes; the percentages of CD3(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were also calculated. Immune parameters were monitored on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after sepsis diagnosis to characterize dynamic trajectories. RESULTS: The count and percentage of neutrophils, the count of monocytes, NLR, MLR and CRP in patients with sepsis were significantly increased, while the count and percentage of lymphocytes, the percentage of monocytes, the percentages of CD3(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells were lower as compared to the control. The NLR demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy for sepsis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.981 (95% CI: 0.965 ~ 0.998). The percentage of neutrophils achieved an AUC of 0.980 (95% CI: 0.958 ~ 1.000). The percentage of neutrophils and NLR performed comparably to CRP and outperformed other immune cell indices. The count of monocytes on day 7, the percentage of monocytes on day 7 and 21, the count of lymphocytes on day 7 and 14, the percentage of lymphocytes on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were lower than those in the survival group. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were higher than that in the survival group. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes in the survivors of sepsis trend upward over time. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR show potential as a prognostic biomarker for sepsis and may be useful to predict 28-day hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Day 7 may represent a critical window for prognostic assessment in sepsis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-12048-1."
41462086,Innovative application of mefloquine and Methacycline in combating Tet(X3/X4)-positive Escherichia coli infections.,2025,"The advent and global spread of plasmid-carried resistance genes, including the tigecycline resistance gene tet(X3/X4) and the colistin resistance gene mcr-1, present a substantial threat to public health that requires immediate resolution. This study successfully screened and identified commercial anti-parasitic drugs that efficiently inhibit Tet(X4) enzyme activity (IC(50) = 79.42 microg/mL), revealing that mefloquine exhibited a synergistic antibacterial effect with tetracyclines against tet(X3/X4)-positive bacteria (FIC < 0.5) and an additive effect with tetracyclines against tet(X3/X4)-negative bacteria (0.5 < FIC < 1, excluding minocycline). Molecular dynamics simulations and checkerboard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests on Tet(X4) mutants in amino acid residues demonstrated that mefloquine's interaction with the active site of Tet(X4) reduces its activity. The energy contribution of the binding site residues involves PHE221, PHE316, GLY233, PRO315, PHE232, MET212, ALA222 and HIE231, which establish robust interactions with mefloquine (Delta(Etotal) of </= - 0.5 kcal/mol). Moreover, findings from metabonomics, bacterial membrane analysis, ROS detection, NAD(+)/NADH ratio determination, and intracellular ATP determination indicated that mefloquine may significantly influence bacterial energy metabolism (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the mouse infection model of E. coli 47EC, the combination of methacycline and mefloquine, demonstrated significant therapeutic advantages, as evidenced by an increased survival rate (from 20.00% to 80.00%), decreased sepsis score, and decreased bacterial load. Our work is the first to reveal that the commercial medicine mefloquine can prolong the efficacy of tetracycline and treat infections caused by drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in clinical environments."
41461922,Microbial collagenase activity is linked to oral-gut translocation in advanced chronic liver disease.,2026,"Microbiome perturbations are associated with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD), but how microorganisms contribute to disease mechanisms is unclear. Here we analysed metagenomes of paired saliva and faecal samples from an ACLD cohort of 86 individuals, plus 2 control groups of 52 healthy individuals and 14 patients with sepsis. We identified highly similar oral and gut bacterial strains, including Veillonella and Streptococcus spp., which increased in absolute abundance in the gut of patients with ACLD compared with controls. These microbial translocators uniquely share a prtC gene encoding a collagenase-like proteinase, and its faecal abundance was a robust ACLD biomarker (area under precision-recall curve = 0.91). A mouse model of hepatic fibrosis inoculated with Veillonella and Streptococcus prtC-encoding patient isolates showed exacerbation of gut barrier impairment and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, faecal collagenase activity was increased in patients with ACLD and experimentally confirmed for the prtC gene of translocating Veillonella parvula. These findings establish mechanistic links between oral-gut translocation and ACLD pathobiology."
41461844,Elevated lactate-to-albumin ratio predicts short- and long-term mortality in trauma and surgical intensive care patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV cohort study.,2025,"The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR), as a composite biomarker of integrated metabolic stress and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated prognostic utility in critical illnesses like sepsis and acute pancreatitis. However, its role in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (SICU/TSICU) patients remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between LAR and mortality in SICU/TSICU patients. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database. Adult SICU/TSICU patients with lactate and albumin measurements within 24 h of admission were included. Exclusion criteria were: repeat ICU admissions, ICU stay < 24 h, and missing lactate or albumin data. Ultimately, 2,665 patients were categorized into quartiles based on LAR. Multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and Kaplan-Meier analyses were employed to evaluate the relationship between LAR and 28-day and 365-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed interactions and robustness. The 28-day mortality and 365-day mortality rates reached 17.94% and 31.26%, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that elevated LAR independently predicted higher mortality risks (adjusted HR = 1.26, 95% CI:1.19-1.33 for 28-day; HR = 1.20, 95% CI:1.14-1.26 for 365-day), with a dose-response relationship across quartiles (P for trend < 0.001). RCS analysis showed a nonlinear association between LAR and 28-day mortality (P for nonlinear = 0.032). The 365-day RCS analysis demonstrated a significant overall positive association between LAR and mortality risk (P for overall < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency and robustness. Elevated LAR shows significant association with both short- and long-term mortality in SICU/TSICU patients, suggesting potential utility as a complementary prognostic tool. Further validation is warranted before clinical implementation."
41461258,Carbapenem resistant gram negative bacteremia in intensive care unit patients: Development and validation of a nomogram-based 30-day mortality risk prediction model.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bloodstream infections (CR-GNB BSIs) are increasingly prevalent in intensive care units (ICUs) and associated with high mortality. Accurate early risk stratification tools are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To develop and internally validate a nomogram-based model predicting 30-day mortality in ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs at a tertiary hospital in western Turkey (January 2020-October 2024). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were collected. Patients were randomly split into training (70 %) and validation (30 %) cohorts. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified independent mortality predictors, which were incorporated into a nomogram. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision-curve utility were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients were included (median age 66 years; 60.9 % male); 30-day mortality was 58 %. Acinetobacter spp. predominated (51.6 %), followed by Klebsiella spp. (42.3 %) and Pseudomonas spp. (6.1 %). Independent predictors of 30-day mortality included older age, immunosuppression, hypoalbuminemia, elevated white blood cell count, and absence of microbiological cure. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC 0.895 training; 0.854 validation), good calibration (mean absolute error 0.022-0.059), and meaningful clinical net benefit across intermediate risk thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated a nomogram using routine clinical and laboratory variables to predict 30-day mortality in ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs. This tool may support early prognostic assessment at bedside and guide individualized management. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted."
41460795,Analysis of blood culture practices in multicenter university-affiliated hospitals in Korea: A retrospective study focused on procedural optimization.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Blood culture is an essential diagnostic tool for detecting bloodstream infections, particularly in patients with suspected sepsis. Routine implementation in healthcare settings necessitates adherence to standardized protocols to ensure diagnostic accuracy. We assessed blood culture practices in university-affiliated hospitals across Korea by analyzing key performance metrics and related indicators. METHODS: In 2024, a standardized questionnaire was distributed to 14 university-affiliated hospitals. The survey collected data on blood culture practices during 2023, including the total number of cultures performed, the number of sets obtained per episode, the frequency of repeated cultures, the volume of blood collected per bottle, discrepancies in culture results, the types of organisms isolated, and post-test reporting practices. RESULTS: In 2023, the median number of blood cultures requested per 1,000 hospitalized patients was 166.6 (43,699 cultures among 241,053 admissions). Two-set collections were most common (median 68.9%), followed by single-set collections (13.0%). Repeat cultures were more frequently performed following negative results (29.2%) than positive ones (5.5%). The median volume collected was 4.0 and 4.3 mL for aerobic and anaerobic bottles, respectively. Only 16.7% of Gram stain results were reported within 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: Blood culture practices, particularly regarding test ordering and the use of two or more sets per episode, appear generally appropriate. However, specific aspects-including the indications for repeat cultures, adequacy of collected blood volume, and timeliness of Gram stain reporting-require further evaluation and targeted quality improvement efforts."
41460586,Neutrophil extracellular traps associated with severity and prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia.,2025,"This study aimed to verify whether neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was related to the severity of respiratory tract infections (RTI) and establish a prognostic model for severe respiratory infections. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from RTI patients for RNA sequencing. Weighted Graph Co-expression Network Analysis was performed to identify gene modules and analyze the correlation between gene modules and clinical features. The prognostic model was established by LASSO regression. The concentration of IL-8 in plasma was measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gene expression levels in PBMC were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In total, 120 patients with RTIs were enrolled between July 2022 and March 2024. Enrichment analysis showed that NETs formation was enhanced during the early stages of pneumonia and sepsis. IL-8 had the strongest correlation with NETs formation, and the concentration of IL-8 in the plasma of patients with sepsis was significantly higher than that in patients with pneumonia and healthy controls (p < 0.001). NET-related genes were positively correlated with the SOFA score and 7-category ordinal scale. The expression level of MPO and PADI4 in sepsis patients were higher than that in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) alone and healthy controls. The AUC of the prognostic prediction model for severe CAP composed of two genes (PADI4-CD177) showed the best performance, with an AUC of 0.917. This study confirmed that NETs formation was activated in RTI and the 2-gene signature provided a rapid and highly accurate biomarker for predicting the prognosis of severe CAP, which awaits further verification in a prospective cohort."
41460289,SIRT2 Regulates Ex Vivo PBMC Adhesion in Septic Shock Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is deadly. Sepsis-immune response transitions from an endotoxin-sensitive, hyper-inflammatory phase to an endotoxin-tolerant hypo-inflammatory phase. In mice, we implicated sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) for prolonged hypo-inflammation using leukocyte adhesion, the earliest in vivo inflammatory response to cytokine, chemokine, and metabolite stimuli. The role of SIRT2 in human sepsis remains unknown. We hypothesized that: 1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) adhesion response can be used as a physiological biomarker of hypo-inflammation, and 2. SIRT2 regulates the functions of PBMCs and macrophages during the hypo-inflammatory phase of human sepsis. METHODS: We stimulated control and SS-whole blood and PBMCs +/- lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and investigated plasma cytokines, PBMC cell adhesion to ICAM-1 coated plates, adhesion molecule CD18 activation, SIRT2 expression, and cytokine response. In adhesion/endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and THP-1 cells treated +/- SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7, we analyzed cell adhesion, CD18 activation, and transmigration +/- LPS. In monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from SS vs. controls +/- AK-7, we analyzed phagocytosis. RESULTS: We found: 1. Muted plasma TNF and IL-1beta-response to LPS in SS vs. control (endotoxin-tolerance) 2. Endotoxin-tolerant SS-PBMCs exhibit high SIRT2 expression, and muted adhesion (adhesion-tolerance), CD18 activation, and transmigration with LPS. 3. SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 reverses endotoxin and adhesion-tolerance in SS-PBMCs via CD18 activation, reverses the defective transmigration of endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and improves phagocytosis in MDMs from SS patients. CONCLUSION: PBMC adhesion, a physiological biomarker, can be used to detect hypo-inflammation. Defective PBMC and macrophage function in septic shock patients occur via high SIRT2 expression. SIRT2 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating sepsis-associated hypo-inflammation."
41459929,Pharmacokinetics and safety of fosfomycin and flomoxef administered as part of neonatal sepsis treatment (NeoSep1 Part 1).,2026,"Neonatal doses for the off-patent antibiotics fosfomycin and flomoxef, which offer coverage against many extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, are based on limited data. We performed a pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study of fosfomycin and flomoxef to confirm proposed neonatal dosing before further investigation in a trial (NeoSep1, ISRCTN48721236). Neonates with suspected sepsis, weighing more than 1,000 g, were sequentially enrolled into three antibiotic treatment cohorts: fosfomycin and amikacin (Cohort 1), flomoxef and amikacin (Cohort 2), and flomoxef and fosfomycin (Cohort 3), and followed for 28 days. Plasma samples were taken for PK assessment, with population PK modeling and simulations performed. Sixty-two neonates (48/62 [77%] preterm; 48/62 [77%] </=7 days postnatal age [PNA]) received at least one dose of study antibiotics. Fosfomycin and flomoxef plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment and a one-compartment model, respectively, with postmenstrual age and PNA significantly influencing clearance. The probability of target attainment for fosfomycin was 100% for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of up to 8 mg/L, and for flomoxef, it was 100% for MICs of up to 0.5 mg/L. Adverse events (AEs) were common in this critically ill cohort. Thirteen (21%) neonates developed 19 trial antibiotic-related AEs (17 with grade </=2, and 2 of grade 3), none of which required modification or discontinuation of allocated treatment. Seven neonates (11.6%) died. In this predominately preterm population, fosfomycin and flomoxef were safe, with drug exposures similar to published studies supporting the proposed doses for the larger, randomized NeoSep1 trial.This study is registered with ISRCTN48721236."
41458791,Shivering During Transurethral Ureterolithotripsy Predicted Postoperative Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"Patients may develop septic shock following transurethral ureterolithotripsy (TUL). However, intraoperative symptoms that may be indicative of sepsis remain largely understudied. We encountered a case in which shivering during spinal anesthesia predicted bacteremia, consequently enabling early therapeutic intervention for sepsis. A 68-year-old woman had diabetes, severe obesity (BMI 45 kg/m(2)), sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient was hospitalized multiple times for calculous pyelonephritis due to a right, coral-shaped calculus and received antimicrobial therapy. TUL was scheduled for the right coral-shaped calculus. Spinal anesthesia was administered, and surgery was initiated after confirming loss of cold sensation at T4. The patient developed severe shivering, nausea, and vomiting approximately 50 minutes after lithotripsy initiation. Vital signs showed no significant changes compared with those at admission and did not indicate shock. However, the symptoms were considered initial signs of bacteremia. Therefore, surgery was terminated. Arterial and central venous lines were inserted while the patient was in the operating room, before admission to the ICU. Upon ICU admission, the patient presented with hypotension (systolic blood pressure </=70 mmHg) and hyperlactatemia. The patient was consequently diagnosed with septic shock. Norepinephrine, dobutamine, and respiratory support were initiated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Tracheal intubation and vasopressin administration were performed the day after surgery. Thermoregulatory shivering can occur during spinal anesthesia, owing to the use of intrapyelic perfusion fluid during lithotripsy. However, the shivering observed in this case was highly likely to be the initial symptom of bacteremia. Furthermore, the patient had a preoperative urinary tract infection, suggesting a high risk for sepsis and endotoxic shock. This case confirms that chills and rigors may be early indicators of bacteremia. Moreover, it suggests that intraoperative shivering is an initial symptom of bacteremia."
41458726,"Acute Compartment Syndrome: A Short Narrative Review of the Risk Factors, Complications, and Medicolegal Impact of a Missed Diagnosis.",2025,"Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a frequently encountered surgical emergency in trauma and orthopaedics. Timely diagnosis and prompt surgical fasciotomy of the involved compartments prevent complications, which can cause long-term morbidity, rehabilitation, renal failure, multiorgan failure, and even death if management is delayed or diagnosis is missed. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise existing literature on ACS, its complications, and the medicolegal impact when a diagnosis is delayed or missed. A narrative review was conducted using evidence from EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar. There is extensive literature on the diagnosis and presenting signs and symptoms of ACS. However, not the same can be said about the effect of ACS on kidney function, rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure, and death. ACS is associated with a multitude of complications and has systemic effects, including electrolyte imbalance, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Overall, ACS is one of the most common causes of litigation in trauma and orthopaedics, and care must be taken to remember that not all ACS is associated with trauma and fractures, resulting in higher rates of delayed diagnosis. To avoid litigation and morbidity to patients, timely diagnosis of ACS is essential, combined with avoiding delays to fasciotomy. Overall, ACS can cause devastating effects to patients, even without a missed diagnosis, as its complications can range from toe clawing and Volkmann contractures to muscle necrosis, which develops into sepsis and can cause multiorgan failure and death."
41458684,Percutaneous Nephrostomy and Ureteroscopic Management of Bilateral Renal Papillary Necrosis in an Elderly Female.,2025,"Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) is a rare but clinically significant cause of obstructive uropathy, often associated with infection, diabetes mellitus, analgesic abuse, or systemic vascular comorbidities. Timely diagnosis and intervention are essential to prevent irreversible renal injury and sepsis. An 84-year-old female with multiple chronic comorbidities, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and long-term anticoagulation therapy, presented with acute severe left-sided loin pain, fever, and vomiting. Imaging revealed bilateral hyperdense lesions at the ureteropelvic junctions, initially mimicking calculi. Flexible ureteroscopy later confirmed sloughed necrotic papillae, consistent with bilateral RPN. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous nephrostomy for decompression, followed by definitive ureteroscopic retrieval of necrotic tissue. Histopathology demonstrated fibrosis, tubular epithelial erosion, and ischemic necrosis without evidence of malignancy. The patient showed marked clinical improvement, normalization of renal function, and complete radiological resolution at one-month follow-up. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, prompt decompression, and coordinated multidisciplinary management in obstructive RPN. A structured diagnostic and therapeutic approach can lead to full functional recovery even in elderly patients with complex comorbidities."
41458654,Intravesical Fungus Ball Caused by Candida albicans in a Diabetic Patient With Septic Shock: A Case Report.,2025,"Fungal urinary tract infections (UTIs) are rare. In exceptional cases, fungal colonization can lead to the formation of a ""Fungus ball"" or fungal bezoar, which may cause urinary tract obstruction and sepsis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, presenting with septic shock and anuria. Imaging studies revealed an intravesical mass with air locules, and urine cultures grew Candida albicans. Despite systemic antifungal therapy, persistent obstruction required surgical management. A cystoscopy and open surgical approach allowed complete extraction of a fungal bezoar. Histopathological analysis confirmed fungal structures consistent with Candida spp. The patient recovered after systemic fluconazole therapy, with follow-up imaging showing resolution of obstruction. Urinary tract fungus balls are uncommon and often associated with predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus, urinary stasis, and prolonged catheterization. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion supporting images. Treatment includes systemic antifungal therapy and, in selected cases, surgical removal. Although rare, a urinary fungus ball should be considered in diabetic patients with candiduria and obstructive findings on imaging. Early recognition and combined medical-surgical management are essential for favorable outcomes."
41458497,Lactate and procalcitonin combined with qSOFA score for the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in ICU patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and early prognostic assessment is essential for improving outcomes. Although the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is widely used for bedside risk stratification, its standalone predictive performance is limited. Integrating biochemical markers such as lactate and procalcitonin (PCT) may improve prognostic accuracy. This study was designed to evaluate the combined value of qSOFA, lactate, and PCT in assessing disease severity and mortality risk, and to clarify the prognostic utility of dynamic monitoring at multiple time points. METHODS: This retrospective study included 128 ICU patients with sepsis, categorized into qSOFA < 2 (n = 57) and qSOFA >/= 2 (n = 71) groups. Lactate and PCT levels were recorded at ICU admission (T0), 24 h (T24), and 72 h (T72). ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and multiple organ failure rates were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with adjustment for age, hypertension, and SOFA score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive performance of qSOFA alone and in combination with the biomarkers. RESULTS: Patients with qSOFA >/= 2 had significantly higher ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05) and exhibited consistently elevated lactate and PCT levels at all three time points (P < 0.01). qSOFA, lactate, and PCT were independent predictors of both ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05). The combined model demonstrated superior discrimination, with AUCs of 0.79 for ICU mortality and 0.81 for 28-day mortality, outperforming qSOFA alone or qSOFA paired with a single biomarker. CONCLUSION: A qSOFA score >/= 2 identifies patients at higher risk of mortality. Dynamic monitoring of lactate and PCT significantly enhances early prognostic evaluation, and their combined use with qSOFA provides improved risk stratification for ICU patients with sepsis."
41458356,"Comprehensive Review of Sepsis-Related Skeletal Muscle Atrophy: Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Therapeutic Strategies.",2025,"This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current evidence on sepsis-related skeletal muscle atrophy, with a focus on underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic interventions. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to October 2024, including clinical, translational, and animal studies. We critically analyzed the pathophysiological mechanisms linking sepsis to muscle wasting, including inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteolytic pathways. Epidemiological data indicate a high incidence of muscle atrophy in sepsis patients, particularly among the elderly and those with comorbidities. Diagnostic modalities such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, and emerging biomarkers including urinary titin and myokines are discussed. Treatment strategies encompassing nutritional support, pharmacotherapy (eg, GLP-1RAs, myostatin inhibitors), and rehabilitation are evaluated. Controversies regarding etiology and treatment efficacy are highlighted. Future directions include the exploration of novel biomarkers, genomics-based personalized therapy, and long-term outcome studies. This review provides a structured and critical appraisal of the current state of knowledge, aiming to inform clinical practice and future research."
41457758,Revolutionizing non-traumatic acute care: review of the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in triaging and diagnosis.,2025,"Acute care settings, including emergency medicine and intensive care units, comprise a substantial portion of healthcare and are essential in the prompt management of conditions that can prove fatal. Critical care conditions require timely management that can be delayed by high patient volumes and the need for complex clinical decision making. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been created to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflow to improve patient care. This narrative review discusses the current status of AI in acute care, with a focus on its applications in triaging and diagnosis. AI-enhanced electrocardiogram analysis, identification of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure risk stratification led to better patient-specific management and improved results. AI models successfully determined and aided in the timely management of various acute conditions, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The AI algorithms used accurately determined sepsis onset and course, superseding traditionally used clinical tools and leading to early diagnosis and reduced sepsis mortality. These models showed high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing and triaging neurological conditions, including altered levels of consciousness, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhages. AI that involved advanced machine learning imaging software led to faster and more accurate stroke diagnosis. Diagnostic tools assisted by AI improved the detection and classification of acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. AI has shown promising results in optimizing management in acute care settings. However, critical issues in data standardization, ethical considerations, and clinical workflow integration need to be addressed to enable clinical implementation."
41457045,A new proposed approach to categorize sepsis sub-phenotypes based on combined trajectories of perfusion index and central venous oxygen saturation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Circulatory disturbances in sepsis are heterogeneous but often present clinically as a mismatch between peripheral perfusion and tissue oxygenation. Peripheral perfusion index (PI) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) have been independently validated as prognostic markers in sepsis; however, their combined utility has not been systematically explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2021. A novel index, PISO = (PI - 1.1) x ScvO(2), was calculated every 6 hours during the first 72 hours following sepsis onset. Dynamic time warping and hierarchical agglomerative clustering were applied to the 72-hour PISO trajectories to identify sub-phenotypes, with internal validation and sensitivity analysis. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the sub-phenotypes based on early clinical features. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, with particular focus on the association between 12-hour cumulative fluid balance and 28-day in-hospital survival. RESULTS: Among 12,975 patients, 5,205 (40.1%) developed sepsis. Of these, 720 patients with complete 6-hourly PI and ScvO(2) data were included. Three distinct PISO sub-phenotypes were identified. Phenotype 3, (n = 190, 33.0%), characterized by a persistently declining trajectory from a negative baseline, was associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. The random forest classifier demonstrated best performance and identified key early clinical features that differentiated each sub-phenotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a 12-hour cumulative fluid balance of </=0 mL was significantly associated with improved 28-day survival in Phenotype 1 (p = 0.038) and Phenotype 2 (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A persistently negative and declining PISO index within the first 72 hours of sepsis onset identifies a potential-risk sub-phenotype associated with adverse outcomes. Additionally, a non-positive 12-hour cumulative fluid balance post-sepsis onset is associated with improved survival in select phenotypic subgroups."
41457009,The Ability of NEWS2 to Detect Sepsis in Adult Patients With Positive Blood Cultures.,2025,"Blood stream infections are associated with high mortality and morbidity. NEWS2 is a quick scoring system including bedside measurable vital signs. This study aimed to investigate the ability of NEWS2 >/= 5p to identify sepsis, per Sepsis-3 criteria, among adult patients with community-acquired infection and positive blood cultures. It also explored if NEWS2 >/= 5p could indicate infection etiology based on bacterial species in blood culture. This retrospective study included 555 patients with positive blood cultures. 425 of 555 (76.6%) patients had sepsis. The sensitivity of NEWS2 >/= 5p for detecting sepsis was 86.6% and was not statistically associated with infection etiology. Patients with S. pneumoniae had a higher median NEWS2 score than those with other bacterial species. The 28-day mortality rate was 12.1%, and the sensitivity of NEWS2 >/= 5p for detecting 28-day mortality was 91.0%. NEWS2 >/= 5p was detected in a high proportion of sepsis cases among patients with blood stream infections, independent of bacterial species, and is a quick tool for identifying high sepsis likelihood in the emergency department."
41456980,Risk of endocarditis in patients with bacteraemia by coagulase-negative staphylococci; a multicenter retrospective cohort.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious and under-recognized complication of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteraemia. The aim was to identify predictors of IE in patients with CoNS bacteraemia and to compare the diagnostic performance of different Duke criteria versions. METHODS: We retrospectively included adult patients with CoNS bacteraemia (January 2015-June 2024) from two Swiss university hospitals. Each episode was classified according to the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), 2023 ESC, and 2023 International Society of Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) Duke criteria. IE diagnoses were established by the Endocarditis Teams or expert clinicians. RESULTS: Among 466 episodes, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent pathogen (360; 77 %), followed by S. lugdunensis (47; 10 %). IE was diagnosed in 106 (23 %) episodes. Multivariable logistic regression identified non-nosocomial acquisition (aOR 6.43; 95 % CI 2.97-13.9), presence of intracardiac prosthetic material (15.4; 6.77-34.8), sepsis (2.34; 1.10-5.00), S. lugdunensis (2.99; 1.06-8.43), persistent bacteraemia for >/=48 h (6.88; 3.14-15.1), and embolic events (58.3; 21.2-160.5) as predictors of IE. The 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria demonstrated the highest sensitivity (76 %) but lower specificity (61 %) than the 2015 Duke-ESC (sensitivity 21 %, specificity 98 %) and 2023 Duke-ESC (sensitivity 25 %, specificity 96 %) criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In episodes with CoNS bacteraemia, IE should be strongly suspected in those with persistent bacteraemia, prosthetic intracardiac material, non-nosocomial onset, S. lugdunensis bacteraemia, embolic complications. While the 2023 ISCVID criteria improve sensitivity, their lower specificity highlights the need for further refinement of diagnostic algorithms."
41456846,Impact of anticoagulants and centrifugal forces on plasma neutrophil extracellular traps assay outcomes.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could help prevent and treat thrombosis-related diseases. Detecting NETs primarily relies on plasma; however, the impact of anticoagulants and plasma centrifugation on these results remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the most effective anticoagulant and centrifugation methods for detecting NETs in plasma. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from sepsis rats using sodium citrate and EDTA as anticoagulants. These samples were subjected to various centrifugal forces, durations, and temperatures to determine the optimal method for NETs analysis. Similarly, plasma samples from infected patients were collected and analyzed using different centrifugation techniques to identify the optimal method. Gene expression analysis in endothelial cells stimulated by these plasma samples was conducted to compare the endothelial responses to NETs levels. RESULTS: In rats, EDTA-plasma exhibited increased levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA, while dsDNA levels remained unchanged, with both concentrations being higher at 400 g. Similarly, EDTA and a centrifugal force of 400 g increased MPO-DNA levels without affecting dsDNA levels in patients. Plasma isolated using a centrifugal force of 400 g enhanced adhesion, inflammation, and chemotaxis gene expression in endothelial cells, demonstrating that low centrifugal force is effective for NETs detection. CONCLUSION: For an accurate NETs assay, it is recommended to use EDTA anticoagulant and prepare plasma using a low centrifugal force, such as 400g."
41456741,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy: Unraveling molecular mechanisms, emerging therapeutics, and translational frontiers.",2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a debilitating complication of systemic infection, marked by acute cognitive impairment and long-term neurological deficits in the absence of direct central nervous system (CNS) infection. Its pathogenesis involves a multifactorial interplay of neuroinflammation (e.g., cytokine storms), immune dysregulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, metabolic derangements, and impaired neuronal repair. These mechanisms synergistically contribute to neuronal injury and persistent cognitive dysfunction. Emerging therapeutic strategies-such as targeted immunomodulators, BBB-stabilizing agents, and novel CNS-targeted drug delivery-aim to interrupt this cascade and improve outcomes. Concurrently, precision medicine approaches leverage molecular profiling to tailor interventions. However, current clinical management remains supportive, hindered by incomplete mechanistic understanding and a paucity of disease-modifying therapies. This review synthesizes recent advances in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy, critically evaluates these mechanism-based therapeutic approaches, and highlights translational roadblocks in biomarker development and preclinical-to-clinical bridging. We also propose future directions to accelerate the development of targeted pharmacotherapies and personalized treatment paradigms for sepsis-associated encephalopathy."
41456737,Endothelial Glycocalyx biomarkers in acute lung injury.,2026,"Endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation contributes to vascular and pulmonary dysfunction in acute lung injury (ALI). This study provides a comprehensive review of the structure of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) and the mechanisms underlying its injury. Additionally, it evaluates biomarkers indicative of glycocalyx disruption that have been investigated for clinical use, including syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronan. These biomarkers have been studied in both circulating and airway compartments, with some studies reporting signal size-dependent variations in their levels. Laboratory measurement methods, specifically immunoassays and mass spectrometry, are examined with an emphasis on preanalytical variables, analytical performance, interference, and existing deficiencies in standardization, calibration, and traceability. These deficiencies contribute to the challenges in achieving comparability across different studies. Subsequently, we assessed the evidence regarding the clinical utility of risk stratification and outcome prediction in the context of ALI/ARDS and sepsis heterogeneity, focusing on cohort characteristics, sampling intervals, and sample types. In conclusion, we propose the implementation of novel glycocalyx-stabilizing treatments and future advancements, such as multi-marker panels and their integration with microvascular imaging. Generally, the standardization of protocols and establishment of reporting systems are essential prerequisites for the incorporation of these biomarkers into routine clinical laboratory and intensive care unit workflows as reliable tools."
41456707,Comprehensive management of infectious cellulitis:From epidemiology to hospital approach in Spain.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Cellulitis is a skin and soft tissue infection caused by the entry of a microorganism into the subcutaneous tissue. Nowadays it represents one of the main causes of hospital admission, mainly due to incorrect diagnosis or the need for intravenous treatment. The aim of this study is to observe the characteristics of cellulitis in patients admitted to our hospital during two years in order to determine whether admissions were really necessary. METHODS: Retrospective study of admissions for cellulitis between 2022 and 2023 at the Salamanca University Hospital, classified according to the CREST-SEWS criteria. RESULTS: During the study period, 332 patients with cellulitis were admitted to the Salamanca University Hospital. 56% of the patients were classified as grade II (those who do not have severe symptoms, but who are usually admitted due to their comorbidities). 70% of the patients had some comorbidity or risk factor such as skin disorders, type II diabetes mellitus or heart failure. The most common site of infection was the lower extremities. The etiologic agent of the infection could be established in 28% of the patients, and the most frequently isolated microorganism was methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The most common treatment was beta-lactams, specifically amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (39.5%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (23.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In order to treat infectious cellulitis, it is essential to carry out a correct etiological diagnosis in order to establish the most appropriate treatment and reduce unnecessary admissions, especially in patients with class II cellulitis."
41456572,Dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio for infection diagnosis and mortality risk stratification in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Two crucial needs persist in delivering effective critical care: reliable differentiation of infectious vs non-infectious systemic inflammation and detection of impending sepsis before the occurrence of organ dysfunction. This prospective cohort study evaluates the clinical utility of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) biomarker CD177/CD10 ratio to differentiate and monitor infections. METHODS: A total of 219 healthy volunteers and 145 patients were assigned to four clinically defined groups: healthy controls (HC), non-infectious inflammation (NI), non-septic infection (NS-I), and sepsis (S). Serial flow cytometric analysis of CD177 and CD10 expression in PMNs was conducted with longitudinal monitoring. Diagnostic efficacy was standardised against conventional biomarkers and organ dysfunction indices. A dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system (rising/declining/stable pattern) was established for prognostic stratification. FINDINGS: The CD177/CD10 ratio exhibited superior diagnostic performance in infection identification. At a cut-off point (CFP) of 6.07, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the ratio to differentiate NS-I from S was 0.92, exceeding those of CRP (0.85) and PCT (0.85). Notably, this biomarker effectively differentiated NI (CFP = 0.67, AUC = 0.79) from NS-I (CFP = 0.98, AUC = 0.71). The dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system showed robust prognostic efficacy: patients with the rising subtype exhibited a 7-day mortality rate of 62.5%, while those with decreasing and stable subtypes demonstrated survival rates of 85% and 92.59%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The CD177/CD10 ratio can facilitate infection-specific differentiation and real-time therapeutic monitoring by quantifying the dynamic equilibrium between the extent of neutrophil activation and maturation. However, the CD177/CD10 ratio still requires validation through a multi-centre trial to confirm the generalisability of the established diagnostic and prognostic thresholds.

41456283,[Cerebral and extrancerebral complications combined with otogenic meningitis with various outcomes].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To increase the effectiveness of treatment of patients with otogenic meningitis based on the analysis of the frequency and structure of cerebral complications (CC) and extracerebral complications (ECC) with different outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis of variants of the clinical course of otogenic purulent meningitis OPM in 51 patients with the isolation of combined CC and ECC, the immediate causes of death, was carried out. RESULTS: OPM in 66.7+/-6.6% of cases was accompanied by combined central nervous system diseases, which in descending order included encephalitis, epidural empyema, thrombophlebitis of the cerebral sinuses and intracerebral abscess. In case of fatal outcomes of OPM, compared with favorable ones, the frequency of CC increased significantly in association with acute purulent otitis media (APOM) - from 50.0+/-10.7% to 92.9+/-8.5 (p</=0.02), to a lesser extent with exacerbation of chronic purulent otitis media (CPOM) - from 71.4+/-12.1% to 80.0+/-17.9. Sepsis was detected in all fatal cases, with favorable cases - in 54.5+/-10.6% in association with APOM and 21.4+/-11.0% with CPOM (p</=0.05). Infectious-toxic shock (40%), bilateral focal-drain pneumonia (33.3%) and cerebral edema (26.7%) were noted as the direct causes of death. CONCLUSION: An analysis of the clinical course and thanatogenesis of OPM allows us to state that combined CC and ECC significantly increase the risk of fatal complications."
41455529,Fungal false positive in BioFire(R) FilmArray(R) analysis for bloodstream infection.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The BioFire FilmArray(R) system is an automated multiplex PCR tool for detecting pathogens in clinical samples. False positives occasionally occur due to cross-reactivity, contamination, or assay specificity issues. This study investigated false-positive fungal results in FilmArray(R) blood culture identification panel 2 (BCID2) detection system. METHOD: We collected the continuous cases in which bloodstream infection (BSI) was suspected in our institute for 12 months, from April in 2024 to March in 2025. We routinely used Bactec FX culture system (Beckton Dickinson) with BD BACTEC culture bottles. Alongside, we identified fungus using standard culture method and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (biomerieux, VITEK MS PRIME). RESULTS: We evaluated continuous 454 blood culture positive sample. Average blood culture sampling were totally 5357 samples per year (44.3/1000 patients days) of blood cultures during our study period. We collected 28 cases of fungemia among totally recruited 454 samples (6.2 %, 28/454). Accordance of blood culture and FilmArray(R) were 50.0 % (14 samples). We observed eight false positive samples (1.8 %. 8/454) as fungemia out of total 454 samples, in where one false organism was Candida albicans and seven were Candida tropicalis. In the cases of four false Candida tropicalis samples, the FilmArray(R) reported the two fungal combination, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. CONCLUSION: Our investigation revealed a substantial incident of false positive of Candida. The study highlights recurrent false positives of Candida tropicalis, often detected alongside Candida parapsilosis. The main cause of the detection of false positive organism in BCID2 including Candida spp. has been reported as contamination or technical errors. We speculated that our observation could be derived from the non-viable DNA fragments (Candida albicans) contained in the blood culture media and cross-reaction of Candida parapsilosis with Candida tropicalis. We should remember these FilmArray(R) assay limitations linked to non-viable DNA contamination and high reactivity of sensitive PCR analysis. False positive results for Candida spp. in BCID2 assays require careful interpretation with microbiological expertise. Clinical decisions should be guided by the patient's overall context. Further research is necessary to assess the accuracy of fungal BSI. (341/500 words)."
41454221,Optimizing diagnosis of Bacillus cereus bacteremia using time to positivity: a retrospective observational study to differentiate true bacteremia from contamination.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacillus cereus can occasionally cause invasive infections, irrespective of the host's immune status. However, the presence of B. cereus in a single blood culture is typically considered a contaminant, potentially leading to an underestimation of the true incidence of B. cereus bacteremia. This study aimed to evaluate the cut-off value for time to positivity (TTP) to distinguish true bacteremia from contamination. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients with positive blood cultures for B. cereus between November 2011 and February 2025. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of TTP, which was achieved by plotting the sensitivity (the true-positive rate) on the y-axis against 1 - specificity (the false-positive rate) on the x-axis for a series of potential TTP cut-off points. RESULTS: During the study period, 49 patients were enrolled, of whom 18 were classified into the true bacteremia group and 31 into the contamination group. All patients had at least two sets of blood cultures collected. The median TTP was significantly shorter among patients in the true bacteremia group (7.8 h; interquartile range [IQR], 6.5-8.9) than in the contamination group (11.2 h; IQR, 9.9-13) (p < 0.001). ROC curve analysis indicated that a cutoff value of 9.0 h achieved the highest sensitivity (77.8%) and specificity (90.3%) for predicting true bacteremia, while a more lenient threshold of TTP > 13.0 h yielded 100% sensitivity for identifying contamination. CONCLUSIONS: A cut-off value of 9.0 h can differentiate true B. cereus bacteremia from contamination, whereas a TTP > 13 h is indicative of contamination. Given its suboptimal diagnostic accuracy, TTP can help differentiate true B. cereus bacteremia from contamination but should be interpreted with clinical and laboratory data for the diagnosis of sepsis."
41451718,Duodenojejunostomy versus Duodenoduodenostomy in Congenital Duodenal Obstruction: A retrospective study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital duodenal obstruction (CDO) is a common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction, most requiring surgery to restore bowel continuity. Duodenoduodenostomy (DD) is the preferred procedure, but duodenojejunostomy (DJ) may be performed when DD is not feasible due to anatomy, particularly in small or premature infants. In our centre, choice of procedure was based on intraoperative findings, tension-free anastomosis feasibility, and surgeon preference. This study compared short-term outcomes of DJ and DD in CDO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a cross-sectional about outcome of congenital duodenal obstruction at Hasan Sadikin Bandung General Hospital in 2019-2024. Data were collected through medical records, including gestational age, age at surgery, surgical technique, operation time, time to first feed, time to full feed, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: There were a total of 36 congenital duodenal obstruction patients. There were 4 patients (11%) who died before surgery, and 32 patients (89%) underwent surgery. All procedures were performed open surgery. Duodenojejunostomy was performed in 10 patients (31%), duodenoduodenostomy in 22 patients (69%). Time to first feed (mean) is post operative day 8 vs 9 (P = 0.3), time to full feed (mean) post operative day 27.1 vs 25.4 (p=0.8) and length of stay (mean) 27.6 days vs 34.6 days (p=0.9). Three patient of each group died post operative due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Duodenojejunostomy and duodenoduodenostomy have similar outcomes in neonates with congenital duodenal obstruction. These findings are relevant for surgeons who repair congenital duodenal obstruction with duodenojejunostomy or duodenoduodenostomy in open surgery."

41451099,Case Report: Maternal near-miss-recovery from refractory septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction secondary to acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections during pregnancy represent a significant clinical concern, posing considerable risks to both maternal and fetal health. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy increase the susceptibility to infections, with an estimated 15 to 20% of acute pyelonephritis cases potentially progressing to bacteremia, particularly in the context of urinary stones. The onset of sepsis may lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction, adversely affecting the kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, and central nervous system. Recent research into the pathogenesis of sepsis has provided insight into how inflammation and the activation of immune responses can induce abnormalities in circulatory function, subsequently triggering systemic ischemia and resulting hypoxia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old pregnant woman presented with acute renal colic and fever, leading to the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and acute pyelonephritis. The clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, evolving into uroseptic shock, cardiogenic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This alarming progression necessitated her admission to the intensive care unit, where she received aggressive treatment interventions, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Remarkably, these life-saving measures proved successful. After nine days in intensive care, she fully recovered and was discharged. CONCLUSION: This case study explores three critical clinical challenges: strategies for early identification of high-risk pregnant women for sepsis; optimal timing for interventions in obstructive urinary tract infections to prevent septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction; and the implementation of mechanical circulatory support. The circulatory support protocol highlights the importance of personalized interventions in complex medical scenarios."
41451084,Early prediction of ARDS caused by non-pulmonary sepsis based on machine learning algorithms of inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. Early identification and prediction of the occurrence of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis patients are of vital importance for timely intervention and improving the prognosis of these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 482 patients were included in this study. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method was employed to identify the key variables related to the prognosis of sepsis. The selected variables were used to construct nine different machine learning prediction models. To evaluate the performance of the model, we employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, calibration curve, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). The clinical significance of the model was further analyzed through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis. RESULTS: Through the RFE method, the final selected 11 variables. In the training set and test set, the AUC of the LightGBM model was 0.954 (95% CI: 0.933-0.973) and 0.923 (95% CI: 0.864-0.967) respectively. In this study, the calibration curve of the LightGBM model was close to the diagonal, indicating that its probability predictions were relatively reliable. In the DCA curves, the LightGBM model consistently maintained the highest net gain within the threshold range of 0-0.4, indicating LightGBM has greater clinical practical value. Through SHAP analysis, it was found that the SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, lactate level, creatinine, and SAPS II score were the five most important features in the model prediction. CONCLUSION: In this study, a machine learning model based on inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters was successfully developed and validated to predict the risk of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis."
41449806,Risk and prognosis of colorectal cancer following bacteraemia with Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus complex: A Swedish nationwide retrospective cohort study.,2025,"There is a positive association between bacteraemia with Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the relationship between the timing of SBSEC bacteraemia and CRC is not well-established. Associations with other gastrointestinal cancers have also been suggested. Using national registries, we retrospectively examined the incidence of CRC and other gastrointestinal cancers after SBSEC-bacteraemia in Sweden 2010-2019, and analysed the timing, characteristics, and prognosis of diagnosed CRC. Individuals with SBSEC-bacteraemia were matched to randomly selected controls from the general population at a 1:10 ratio. Cox-regression determined CRC hazard ratios (HR). In total, 908 individuals with SBSEC-bacteraemia were identified and 9,080 controls, of whom 75/908 (8.3%) and 168/9080 (1.9%) respectively had previously diagnosed CRC (p < 0.01). During follow-up of individuals without previous CRC, CRC was diagnosed in 45/833 (5.4%) individuals with SBSEC and 114/8912 (1.3%) controls (p < 0.01). The HR of CRC diagnosis for SBSEC was 10.3 (95% CI 6.7-15.8) overall and 19.8 (95% CI 11.1-35.3) during the first year of follow-up. In conclusion, there was an increased incidence of CRC, and most were diagnosed within the first year. Neither the tumour location, -stage, or -grade of diagnosed CRC nor the rates of other gastrointestinal cancers differed significantly."
41449431,Association between serum osmolality trajectories and mortality in sepsis patients: a retrospective multi-cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis commonly leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, often reflected in abnormal serum osmolality. Although static measurements of osmolality have been investigated, the prognostic significance of dynamic changes in serum osmolality over time remains poorly understood in patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 22,737 septic patients from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, with external validation performed using an independent cohort of 303 patients from Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital. Latent class trajectory modeling was applied to identify distinct patterns of serum osmolality during the first 4 days in the ICU. The association between trajectory patterns and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Mediation analysis was employed to explore potential biological mechanisms, while parametric g-formula simulations were used to evaluate the impact of trajectory-specific fluid management strategies. RESULTS: Three distinct serum osmolality trajectories were identified: stable (ST), ascending (AS), and descending (DS). Compared to the ST group, both the AS and DS groups were associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.61-2.01 for AS; HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.62-2.06 for DS). Mediation analysis indicated that renal dysfunction (accounting for 11.16% of the total effect, P < 0.001) and cumulative positive fluid balance (11.39%, P < 0.001) partially mediated the observed associations. Parametric g-formula simulations revealed substantial heterogeneity in responses to fluid management across trajectory groups, with optimal fluid strategies varying significantly by trajectory pattern and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Dynamic serum osmolality trajectories are independent predictors of mortality in sepsis, with effects partially mediated through renal dysfunction and fluid imbalance. These findings support the implementation of trajectory-guided precision fluid therapy as a novel framework for individualized sepsis care, challenging one-size-fits-all approaches and offering evidence-based guidance for personalized treatment strategies."
41449279,The impact of neutropenia severity in the setting of recent chemotherapy on mortality in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of non-relapse mortality in cancer patients, with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia increasing infection risk. The prognostic impact of neutropenia remains unclear across cancer subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, comprising deidentified data from over 141 million patients across 105 U.S. health care organizations. Adults with select solid cancers who received chemotherapy and developed severe sepsis with septic shock from 2013 to 2024 were included. Patients were stratified by neutropenia severity (< 0.5 x 103/microL vs. 0.5-1.5 x 103/microL), and propensity score matching was applied to balance demographics, comorbidities, and treatment variables. Outcomes including short- and long-term mortality, organ failure, bacteremia, and immune-related adverse events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 1083 eligible patients (184 severe, 899 mild-moderate neutropenia), severe neutropenia was associated with significantly worse survival at all timepoints, with median survival of 13 days versus 106 days and hazard ratios of 1.56-2.03 from 30 days to 1 year (all p < 0.001). Secondary outcomes showed no difference in immune-related adverse events, a nonsignificant trend toward increased organ failure, and higher rates of bacteremia in the severe neutropenia cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Greater severity of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia is linked to worse short-term survival and increased complications in cancer patients with septic shock. Stratifying by neutrophil count bands revealed that severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(3)/microL) independently predicts poorer outcomes, emphasizing its value for risk stratification and guiding clinical management."
41448497,Causal models and network instability in neurological and psychiatric disorders: Computational and clinical perspectives.,2026,"Self-diagnosis-the capacity of a system to detect and correct its own failures-is a defining property of adaptive systems. In the brain, recursive self-monitoring underlies perception, action, and cognition, but it is also fragile: small imbalances between priors and prediction errors can destabilize entire networks. Similar recursive instabilities are observed in immune collapse during sepsis and in failure modes of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we advance a unified framework of causal models and network instability, integrating predictive coding, computational psychiatry, network neuroscience, immunology, and AI. We analyze Parkinson's disease and sepsis as full case studies, and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as psychiatric parallels. Across these conditions, recursive failures manifest as rigid priors, amplified errors, or oscillatory attractors. Across neurological, psychiatric, and immune systems, recursive instability emerges when imbalances between prior precision and prediction-error precision destabilize feedback loops, leading to rigid, noise-amplified, or oscillatory dynamics. By framing Parkinson's disease, sepsis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder within a shared instability space, the proposed framework links predictive coding with network-level dynamics across biological domains. Clinically, this perspective motivates the development of state-dependent biomarkers and closed-loop interventions-such as adaptive neuromodulation and bioelectronic control-designed to stabilize recursive feedback rather than relying on static, open-loop therapies. Recognizing recursive instability as a transdiagnostic principle highlights shared vulnerabilities across brains, immune systems, and artificial agents, and points toward AI-augmented, causal, and adaptive interventions that integrate computational insight with clinical practice."
41448354,"One-year outcomes by index treatment in older patients with acute cholecystitis. Protocol of the international, prospective, observational GOLDENEYE study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: This research project is motivated by the increasing prevalence of gallstones and biliary tract diseases in patients of advanced age, while also recognizing that the comorbidity burden of this population may necessitate a tailored treatment approach. Acute cholecystitis can rapidly progress to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis and even death. Age per se has no bearing on the severity of acute cholecystitis, but the burden of comorbidity in older patients may lead to rapid disease progression. METHODS: The GOLDENEYE study is an international, multicenter, prospective, observational research project designed to compare the outcomes of different management strategies for acute cholecystitis in seniors. The primary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments-supportive care, percutaneous gallbladder drainage, early or delayed cholecystectomy, and EUS-guided gallbladder drainage-on one-year additional treatment modalities, hospital readmissions, and outpatient care. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and survival rates. The study implements propensity score matching analysis to account for the non-randomized allocation of treatment modalities. Patients >/= 70 years diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, as per the Tokyo guidelines, are included. Exclusion criteria include prior episodes of cholecystitis or pancreatitis, terminal illness, and concurrent diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile duct disease, or digestive malignancy. Data collection is performed with the REDCap platform for data entry and monitoring. DISCUSSION: The GOLDENEYE study aims to generate evidence-based insights that will significantly influence the management of acute cholecystitis in elderly patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare practices in this growing demographic population.

41448106,Validation of the phoenix sepsis score in the pediatric emergency department.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the discriminative performance of the Phoenix sepsis score (PSS) and compare its performance with the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) criteria in predicting in-hospital mortality and bloodstream infection (BSI) among pediatric patients with suspected sepsis presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on pediatric patients (< 0.001), 28-day (p < 0.001), overall mortality (p = 0.001), and BSI (p = 0.032). At a threshold of PSS >/= 2, it outperformed the IPSCC criteria in specificity (0.94 vs. 0.48 for 3-day; 0.95 vs. 0.48 for 28-day and overall mortality; 0.95 vs. 0.49 for BSI) and diagnostic accuracy (0.94 vs. 0.48 for 3-day, 28-day, and overall mortality; 0.93 vs. 0.49 for BSI), all p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: The PSS outperformed the IPSCC criteria in predicting in-hospital mortality among children with suspected sepsis presenting to the ED, and may serve as a feasible prognostic tool."
41446870,From Defense to Dysfunction: Decoding the Paradox of Emergency Granulopoiesis in Sepsis Pathogenesis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host response that culminates in organ dysfunction. Recognizing that many prior reviews treated neutrophils as largely homogeneous or discussed their functions in isolation, we present a framework centered on emergency granulopoiesis that unifies groundbreaking single-cell multi-omics discoveries, bone marrow niche remodeling, and bedside biomarkers such as the immature-to-total neutrophil ratio and sepsis endotypes to explain the shift from defense to dysfunction. As a hallmark adaptation, emergency granulopoiesis rapidly replenishes neutrophils but paradoxically yields immature neutrophils with impaired chemotaxis, excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis)/reactive oxygen species, and immunosuppressive activity that aggravate tissue damage, organ failure, and late immunoparalysis. We synthesize subset-level diversity and map this diversity to transcriptional shifts coupled with epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming as well as stromal inflammation. Clinically, elevated immature-to-total neutrophil ratios and these immature subsets align with disease severity and mortality, supporting biomarker-guided stratification. Stage-specific therapeutic strategies are evaluated along the continuum of emergency granulopoiesis, calibrating NETosis, and modulating metabolic reprogramming and epigenetics to restore neutrophil homeostasis. Furthermore, we delineate testable priorities for future research such as standardizing immature neutrophil phenotyping across cohorts and defining harmonized immature-to-total neutrophil ratio thresholds. By explicitly centering emergency granulopoiesis and integrating single-cell biology with bedside indicators, this review clarifies why a protective program becomes maladaptive in sepsis and outlines practical avenues for targeted interventions and trial design."

41445732,SHKBP1 is a target for sepsis: evidence from WGCNA and multiple machine learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Identifying novel biomarkers for sepsis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Cuproptosis, a recently discovered form of cell death associated with various diseases, has an unclear relationship with sepsis. This study aimed to elucidate the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes(CRGs) in sepsis, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We investigated the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes in sepsis and performed consensus clustering. A diagnostic model for sepsis was constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combined with four machine learning algorithms. Prognosis-related genes were identified via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and validated in septic mice. RESULTS: We identified 28 differentially expressed CRGs and characterized a specific immune landscape. Our findings showed that sepsis samples could be divided into two clusters based on CRGs expression. We established a diagnostic model based on five key genes(SHKBP1,ICAM2,CTSD,SNX3, and SLC22A4), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that SHKBP1 was significantly correlated with both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of CRGs expression in sepsis, establishes a diagnostic model, and identifies SHKBP1 as a biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis prediction, offering new insights for sepsis management."
41445717,Acute renal failure as the initial presentation of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma: A case report.,2025,"T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL) is a rare and aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by a neoplastic proliferation of immature T lymphocytes that is restricted to nodal/extra-nodal sites with minimal involvement of bone marrow. While T-LBL is the second most frequent subtype of pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary renal involvement in T-LBL is exceedingly rare and can pose a significant diagnostic challenge. We present the case of an 11-year-old male who initially presented with new-onset seizure, hypertensive crisis, and acute renal failure. Renal ultrasounds demonstrated enlarged kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation suggestive of medical renal disease. A kidney biopsy was performed, revealing an atypical interstitial T-cell infiltrate with diffuse expression of CD4, CD8, and TdT, raising concern for T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (instead of leukemia) (T-ALL/LBL). A subsequent bone marrow biopsy was negative, and no other sites of involvement were identified on PET/CT, so chemotherapy was deferred until the diagnosis could be confirmed. The patient re-presented 2 months later with visual changes and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI. Repeat kidney biopsy with flow cytometry demonstrated a population of aberrant T cells with CD4/CD8 co-expression. A repeat bone marrow biopsy contained < 1% blasts, and no aberrant lymphocytes were detected in peripheral blood. CT scan revealed new retroperitoneal adenopathy with infiltrative disease involving kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, and liver, consistent with stage IV T-LBL.Kidney involvement in acute LBL is uncommon, and renal failure due to leukemic infiltration is rarely reported. This case underscores the importance of performing kidney biopsies in cases of unexplained acute renal failure and considering lymphoma in the differential for interstitial nephritis, even in the absence of abnormal hematological findings."
41444997,Investigating risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community acquired pneumonia: a model for using only electronic data capture.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America community acquired pneumonia guidelines recommend empiric coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on previous respiratory isolation, recent IV antibiotic use, and locally validated risk factors. This study aims to describe how local risk factors may be determined efficiently using data retrieved electronically. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study focused on the time period May 13, 2020, through June 30, 2024. Consecutive adults admitted to one of five acute care facilities with confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were included. Community-acquired pneumonia was defined as the presence of one or more pneumonia diagnosis codes and an order for a respiratory culture or an antimicrobial with the indication of pneumonia or sepsis, 24 h before or within 48 h after the date and time of admission. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis code for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, any subsequent admission in the study period, or if they had a previous respiratory culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa within a year of admission. The causative pathogen and the presence or absence of evaluated risk factors were electronically abstracted from billing data and health records. Serial quality assessments of electronic data were performed to improve accuracy until a well validated population was determined. RESULTS: There were 4,558 unique patients included. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rates were 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Only age was inversely associated with risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). No significant risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found. CONCLUSIONS: In rural or otherwise resource limited healthcare settings, risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia may be determined using only electronic data capture and the methodology described in this article."
41444865,Hemodynamic subphenotypes in septic shock and their different responses to fluid balance in relation to ICU mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Hemodynamically unstable septic patients often require aggressive fluid resuscitation, but limited evidence exists on which hemodynamic subphenotypes benefit most. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary hospital of China. Patients with septic shock who underwent pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring within 24 h were included from November 2013 to January 2024. We applied latent profile modelling to identify subphenotypes using all hemodynamic parameters monitored via PiCCO. We then tested the association of 48-h fluid balance with ICU mortality in different subphenotypes using logistic regression. RESULT: A total of 691 patients were included. Latent profile models indicated that a four-profile model was the best fit. Hyperdynamic subphenotype (phenotype1) was characterized by highest cardiac output and lowest systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI); high preload subphenotype (phenotype 2) was characterized by highest preload; hypodynamic subphenotype (phenotype 3) was characterised by lowest cardiac output, highest SVRI, lung function, as well as inotropic score; preserved subphenotype (phenotype 4) was presented with relative normal hemodynamic parameters. No significant difference was observed in 24- and 48-hour fluid balance among subphenotypes, and overall, no significant correlation was found between 48-hour fluid balance and ICU mortality. However, a significant interaction existed between 48-hour fluid balance and phenotype 4; in this group, higher fluid balance at 48 h was associated with increased ICU mortality (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Four hemodynamic subphenotypes in septic shock was identified. The impact of 48-hour fluid balance on ICU mortality varied by subphenotype, with increased mortality observed only in the preserved hemodynamic group."
41444646,"""Bifidobacterium longum-reactive T helper cells as marker for intestinal barrier impairment in ICU patients with sepsis"".",2025,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness often leads to the development of intestinal dysbiosis, which can have a significant impact on disease outcome. Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a common problem in intensive care unit patients, particularly those with sepsis. Despite its importance, early and reliable diagnosis of barrier dysfunction and evaluation of therapeutic options remain lacking in clinical practice. Given that intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased translocation of luminal antigens and subsequent priming of naive T cells, we hypothesized that analysis of circulating peripheral antigen-reactive T cells could provide insight into the functionality of the intestinal barrier. RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, 70 ICU patients were enrolled, including those with sepsis, those not meeting sepsis criteria, and COVID-19 patients, as well as 20 healthy volunteers. We identified a sepsis-specific T-helper cell signature in peripheral blood using the antigen-reactive T-cell enrichment (ARTE) technique followed by flow cytometric analysis. This signature was characterized by an expansion of gut trophic Bifidobacterium longum-reactive T-helper cells, indicating significant intestinal barrier dysfunction during sepsis. CONCLUSION: This approach allows the study of intestinal barrier functionality and provides a means to monitor the effects of potential therapeutic interventions over time using blood samples."
41444533,Identification of potential characteristic genes in sepsis utilizing RNA sequencing and gene silence.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a serious condition involving organ dysfunction that can be life-threatening, posing a significant threat to human health. The mortality rate associated with sepsis ranges from 10% to 40%, with severe cases or those involving septic shock exhibiting mortality rates exceeding 50%. OBJECTIVE: Gene sequencing took place on the blood samples that were collected both healthy volunteers and septic patients in this study. Advanced methodologies, including bioinformatics analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), meta-analysis, and single-cell localization analysis, were employed to identify potential biomarkers associated with the immunomodulation of sepsis. The identified molecular markers were further validated through the establishment of a sepsis cell model, gene silence techniques, and an ELISA test experiments to assess inflammatory factors. METHODS: In this study, 23 individuals with sepsis and 10 healthy volunteers as controls, and peripheral blood samples were collected. The blood specimens were processed with the assistance of BGI for comprehensive gene sequencing. Post-sequencing, the data underwent quality control measures and were subsequently analyzed using the online platform iDEP 2.01 ( http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/ ) to identify differentially expressed genes. Conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses on the identified differentially expressed genes.To elucidate core genes from multiple perspectives, a PPI network was created with the help of the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/),facilitatin g the examination of gene interactions in terms of protein. Following the recognition of core genes, sepsis-associated data sets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database. Specifically, the transcriptional expression of the gene S100A11 was analyzed using meta-analysis techniques, and its survival curve was subsequently evaluated.The S100A11 gene, identified through screening, was analyzed using an online visualization system to determine its single-cell localization. Initial findings indicated that the gene is predominantly expressed in macrophages. (THP-1 cells) are known as a human monocytic cell line utilized in studies.We cultured THP-1 cells and differentiated into macrophages, followed by stimulation and transfection with the S100A11 gene. The interference effect of S100A11 was assessed using quantitative fluorescence PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, THP-1 cells were cultured to establish a septic cell model, and S100A11 gene silence experiments were conducted, categorizing the samples into control, sepsis, and gene silence sepsis groups. ELISA was employed to assess the concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that S100A11 is highly expressed in sepsis and is primarily localized in macrophages. The enrichment in signaling pathways, including Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, was uncovered by differential gene expression analysis.S100A11 serves as a critical regulatory node for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Notably, S100A11 was found to be highly expressed in patients with sepsis. This gene plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation during the septic inflammatory response and may be involved in macrophage differentiation, immunomodulation, and the inflammatory processes associated with sepsis."
41444527,Prognostic value of the obstetric specific scoring systems and four years' experience of a tertiary center.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Obstetric sepsis is a significant and preventable cause of maternal mortality. The obstetric modified SOFA (omSOFA) score was created to diagnose sepsis in this population, and the sepsis in obstetrics score (SOS) was developed to predict the need for ICU care. This study investigated the prognostic value of these scores in patients treated in the ICU for obstetric sepsis, analyzed the patients' characteristics, and examined the perinatal outcomes associated with sepsis. METHODS: The study was retrospectively designed, and patients hospitalized in the ICU due to maternal sepsis were evaluated. These patients were divided into two groups based on the length of ICU stay. An ICU stay exceeding 72 h is considered a prolonged stay. The data, including demographics, laboratory results and obstetric outcomes, were compared between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to investigate the performance of omSOFA and SOS scores in predicting prolonged ICU stay and septic shock. RESULTS: The study included 25 women with maternal sepsis. Sepsis developed during pregnancy in 40% of patients, after cesarean section in 28%, after abortion in 20%, and after vaginal delivery in 12%. Septic shock developed in 12% (n = 3) of patients during ICU hospitalization. SOS showed better performance in predicting the need for ICU longer than 72 h (cut-off: 3, AUC:0.865, CI:0.721-1.000, sensitivity:75%, specificity:100% PPV:100% NPV:92.7% p = 0.003). At the same time, omSOFA performed better in predicting septic shock (cut-off: 5, AUC:0.985, CI: 0.941-1.000, sensitivity:100% specificity:95%, PPV:73.2%, NPV:100% p = 0.007). DISCUSSION: Considering that prolonged stay in the ICU and development of septic shock are important determinants of morbidity and mortality, SOS and omSOFA scores could serve as valuable prognostic tools in obstetric sepsis cases."
41444511,GPR43 deficiency aggravates sepsis by promoting gut microbiota-dependent barrier disruption and HIF-1alpha-ENO1 axis-mediated M1 polarization of macrophages.,2025,"BACKGROUND: GPR43, a receptor for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is broadly expressed in intestinal epithelial and immune cells and is essential for preserving barrier integrity and immune homeostasis. Nevertheless, how GPR43 influences gut microbiota composition and intestinal barrier integrity while also regulating macrophage immunometabolism in the context of sepsis remains poorly understood. METHODS: A cecal ligation and puncture model was used to induce sepsis in mice. Survival, histopathology, and immune responses were compared between Gpr43(-/-) and wild-type mice; 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed to evaluate gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles. Antibiotic-mediated microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation were used to assess functional impacts. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were employed to investigate the effects of GPR43 deficiency on macrophage polarization. RNA sequencing, metabolic flux analysis, and Western blotting were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients with sepsis were analyzed for clinical correlation. RESULTS: Gpr43(-/-) mice exhibited significantly reduced survival following CLP, along with impaired intestinal barrier function and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels. Microbiota diversity and SCFA-producing bacteria were markedly decreased, accompanied by reduced SCFA levels in fecal metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) partially restored gut function and survival in Gpr43(-/-) mice. GPR43-deficient macrophages displayed a strong M1-polarized phenotype with the upregulation of the glycolytic enzyme ENO1 and its upstream regulator HIF-1alpha. The inhibition of either ENO1 or HIF-1alpha reversed the proinflammatory phenotype. A clinical data analysis revealed that GPR43 expression was negatively correlated with IL-6, ENO1, and lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS: GPR43 exerts a dual protective role in sepsis by maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and barrier integrity and by modulating macrophage metabolism and polarization via the HIF-1alpha-ENO1 axis. This study provides novel insights into the GPR43 in pathogenesis of sepsis and suggests potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

41444326,Whole transcriptome analysis reveals T cell signaling activation in septic patients with thrombocytopenia.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by a dysregulated immune response to infection, remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Thrombocytopenia, a common sepsis complication, is linked to poor outcomes and reflects disease severity and specific immunological changes affecting patient outcomes. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic differences between septic patients with and without thrombocytopenia and to explore immune features related to clinical outcomes using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We conducted a prospective study on 52 patients who were admitted to ICU for sepsis, including 22 with thrombocytopenia and 30 without. Blood samples were collected on both day 1 and 8, and RNA-Seq was performed to analyze transcriptomic profiles. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to explore biological pathways and processes. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity was assessed using MiXCR and VDJTools software. Thrombocytopenic critically ill septic patients exhibited significantly higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and mortality rates compared to non-thrombocytopenic patients. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles between the two groups, with marked upregulation of myeloproliferative and T-cell activation signaling pathways in thrombocytopenic patients on day 1. Additionally, TCR diversity counts showed no statistically significant differences between thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic patients at day 1 or day 8. Thrombocytopenia in septic ICU patients is associated with altered heme/porphyrin metabolism, erythrocyte development, and immune activation. Lower TCR diversity on day 1 in thrombocytopenic patients suggests early immune repertoire perturbations; however, these findings should be interpreted cautiously and validated with targeted immune repertoire sequencing."
41443212,Predictive Value of Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index in the Prognosis of Sepsis-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,2025,"Aims/Background The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was an independent influence factor for mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a predictive indicator for sepsis. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of combined NLR and SII in sepsis-related ARDS. Methods Patients with sepsis-related ARDS (n = 112), admitted to Pingyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2022 to January 2025, were obtained for retrospective analysis. A survivor group (n = 62) and a non-survivor group (n = 50) were formed based on 28-day survival status. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts were detected, and NLR and SII were subsequently calculated. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to analyze the influences of NLR and SII in the prognosis of sepsis-related ARDS. Results Non-survivor group has longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and white blood cell (WBC) count, and lower lymphocyte count than those of survivor group (p = 0.001, 0.032, 0.028, 0.004, respectively). Both NLR and SII values were elevated in the non-survivor group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR): 1.150, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004-1.317, p = 0.044), ICU length of stay (OR: 1.147, 95% CI: 1.017-1.294, p = 0.026), NLR (OR: 1.158, 95% CI: 1.068-1.255, p < 0.001), and SII >2090.37 (OR: 5.207, 95% CI: 1.800-15.064, p = 0.002) as independent prognostic risk factors. The combined NLR and SII had a superior predictive value (area under the curve (AUC): 0.808, 95% CI: 0.730-0.887, p < 0.001) compared to APACHE II score (AUC: 0.618, 95% CI: 0.503-0.733, p = 0.045), ICU length of stay (AUC: 0.679, 95% CI: 0.573-0.784, p = 0.001), NLR alone (AUC: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.701-0.875, p < 0.001), or SII alone (AUC: 0.748, 95% CI: 0.657-0.840, p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off values for APACHE II score, ICU length of stay, NLR, and SII were 19.5, 15.5, 26.13, and 2090.37, respectively. Conclusion The combination of NLR and SII provides a strong predictive value for the prognosis of sepsis-related ARDS."
41443201,Diagnostic Utility of Combined Serum Procalcitonin and C-Reactive Proteins in Neonatal Sepsis.,2025,"Aims/Background Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is hindered by nonspecific clinical signs and suboptimal biomarkers. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), both individually and in combination, and assess the robustness and clinical utility of a combined predictive model. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort (2022-2025, Longyan First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, China) included 293 neonates (161 with sepsis and 132 controls). Univariate logistic regression was applied to compare the clinical and laboratory parameters between the sepsis and control groups. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, contingency tables, and the DeLong tests. A logistic regression-based combined prediction model was developed using a 7:3 stratified random split into training and validation sets. Model robustness was assessed via calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and visualized as a nomogram. Subgroup and culture-confirmed-only sensitivity analyses further assessed the consistency of the combined predictive model. Results Sepsis cases exhibited significantly higher PCT, CRP, and white blood cell (WBC), and lower hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) (all p < 0.001). Univariate logistic regression confirmed PCT [odds ratio (OR) = 3.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.23-4.93, p < 0.001] and CRP (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.003) as significant predictors of neonatal sepsis. The combined PCT-CRP model provided better diagnostic performance, achieving a significantly greater area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) than either marker alone (0.88 for PCT, 0.87 for CRP) as shown by DeLong test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the model maintained higher sensitivity (82.61%) while significantly improving specificity (93.18%) and overall diagnostic accuracy (87.36%). The nomogram, validated in both sets, exhibited good calibration and net clinical benefit in DCA. Subgroup analysis confirmed consistent predictive performance across gestational age, delivery mode, and sex, with CRP more pronounced in preterm infants. Sensitivity analyses using culture-confirmed sepsis validated model robustness (AUC = 0.94). Conclusion PCT and CRP are key diagnostic biomarkers for neonatal sepsis. Their integration as a combined predictive model significantly enhances diagnostic performance and clinical applicability, providing a practical framework for early sepsis identification and potential for clinical implementation."
41442288,Tailored to Fit Sepsis Individuals: Medical Knowledge Aware Reinforcement Learning Model Offers Optimized Therapeutic Strategies.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, with high morbidity and mortality. Timely treatments and precise interventions are crucial for improving sepsis patient outcomes. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have made promising advances in associating sepsis treatments. However, existing models face obstacles when applied to heterogeneous sepsis patients with an imbalanced distribution of disease severity, struggling to maintain optimal performance. To provide optimal therapeutic intervention strategies for sepsis with different disease severity, we proposed a novel treatment recommendation model named Medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis Position aware Transfer learning - Double Dueling Deep Q Network (MPT-D3QN). Through the attention mechanism, medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis positions were introduced to achieve a more accurate representation of patient states. Subsequently, an offline deep reinforcement learning algorithm was used to recommend therapeutic intervention strategies for a specific patient population. The transfer learning framework was responsible for the information transfer across patient groups in different domains. We trained and tested MPT-D3QN model on the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Compared with the reported strategies in present clinical practice, the MPT-D3QN model could obtain a higher expected return value (12.98 vs. 10.61) and reduce the estimated mortality from 13.20% to 6.15% in all test datasets. Moreover, the experimental test on an external dataset eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) further demonstrated the robust generalization capability of the model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed model not only guaranteed higher expected returns but also generated optimal and interpretable treatment strategies for sepsis with different disease severity."
41439929,Sepsis and the Liver.,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a critical and often early complication of sepsis, defined by distinct hyper-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases that shape patient phenotypes. METHODS: Characterizing these phases establishes a foundation for immunomodulation strategies tailored to individual immune responses, as discussed subsequently. RESULTS: The initial inflammatory response activates pathways such as NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to a cytokine storm that damages hepatocytes and is frequently associated with higher SOFA scores and a higher risk of 28-day mortality. Kupffer cells and infiltrating neutrophils exacerbate hepatic injury by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, thereby causing cellular damage and prolonging ICU stays. During the subsequent immunosuppressive phase, impaired infection control and tissue repair can result in recurrent hospital-acquired infections and a poorer prognosis. Concurrently, hepatocytes undergo significant metabolic disturbances, notably impaired fatty acid oxidation due to downregulation of transcription factors such as PPARalpha and HNF4alpha. This metabolic alteration corresponds with worsening liver function tests, which may reflect the severity of liver failure in clinical practice. Mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by oxidative stress and defective autophagic quality control, impairs cellular energy production and induces hepatocyte death, which is closely linked to declining liver function and increased mortality. The gut-liver axis plays a central role in SALI pathogenesis, as sepsis-induced gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability allow bacterial products, including lipopolysaccharides, to enter the portal circulation and further inflame the liver. This process is associated with sepsis-related liver failure and greater reliance on vasopressor support. Protective microbial metabolites, such as indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), decrease significantly during sepsis, removing key anti-inflammatory signals and potentially prolonging recovery. Clinically, SALI most commonly presents as septic cholestasis with elevated bilirubin and mild transaminase changes, although conventional liver function tests are insufficiently sensitive for early detection. Novel biomarkers, including protein panels and non-coding RNAs, as well as dynamic liver function tests such as LiMAx (currently in phase II diagnostics) and ICG-PDR, offer promise for improved diagnosis and prognostication. Specifying the developmental stage of these biomarkers, such as identifying LiMAx as phase II, informs investment priorities and translational readiness. Current management is primarily supportive, emphasizing infection control and organ support. Investigational therapies include immunomodulation tailored to immune phenotypes, metabolic and mitochondrial-targeted agents such as pemafibrate and dichloroacetate, and interventions to restore gut microbiota balance, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, translational challenges remain due to limitations of animal models and patient heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Future research should focus on developing representative models, validating biomarkers, and conducting clinical trials to enable personalized therapies that modulate inflammation, restore metabolism, and repair the gut-liver axis, with the goal of improving outcomes in SALI."
41439926,Circulating Interleukin-6 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Mortality in Melioidosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Background: Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, remains a major cause of sepsis-related mortality in tropical regions. Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, deaths frequently result from dysregulated host inflammation rather than uncontrolled bacterial replication. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key mediator of systemic inflammation, has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis, but its predictive value in melioidosis has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO CRD420251152797). MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to 15 March 2025. Eligible studies included patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis reporting circulating IL-6 concentrations stratified by survival outcome. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. Heterogeneity and robustness were examined through leave-one-out and sensitivity analyses. Publication bias assessment was not performed due to insufficient study numbers (n = 4). Results: Eight studies were included qualitative systematic review, and four studies comprising 411 patients were eligible for quantitative meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly higher IL-6 levels among non-survivors compared with survivors (SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.02-1.57; I(2) = 86.3%). Leave-one-out diagnostics indicated no single study unduly influenced the pooled effect. Sensitivity analysis excluding the largest dataset reduced heterogeneity to 34.5% and yielded an SMD of 0.51 (95% CI -0.28-1.30), maintaining the same direction of association. Conclusions: Circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in fatal melioidosis and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for mortality. Although interstudy heterogeneity was substantial, the association remained consistent in direction across populations and analytical methods despite the limited number of eligible studies. These findings support further prospective validation of IL-6 in clinical risk stratification and host response-guided management of severe melioidosis, though larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."
41439923,Early CytoSorb Hemoadsorption in a Neutropenic Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patient with Carbapenem-Resistant Pseudomonas Septic Shock and ARDS.,2025,"Neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are at high risk for severe, multidrug-resistant infections. Sepsis due to carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) in this population often leads to septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with historically poor outcomes. CytoSorb hemoadsorption has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy for refractory septic shock, but evidence in hematologic malignancies remains limited. This report describes a 29-year-old male with newly diagnosed AML complicated by neutropenic fever, bacteremia due to CRPA, and subsequent hospital-acquired pneumonia progressing to ARDS. Despite multiple antibiotic regimens and aggressive intensive care management, including mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the patient developed refractory septic shock with persistent lactic acidosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Early adjunctive CytoSorb hemoadsorption was initiated, guided by maximal CytoScore criteria, as part of a comprehensive supportive strategy. Following CytoSorb therapy, the patient demonstrated transient hemodynamic and biochemical improvement; however, profound neutropenia and multi-organ failure persisted. Microbiological clearance of CRPA was not achieved; given confirmed colistin susceptibility and unknown carbapenemase mechanism, a salvage combination of colistin plus ceftazidime-avibactam was employed. Transient hemodynamic improvement was observed after CytoSorb initiation; however, cytokine assays were not performed, and microbiological clearance was not achieved, precluding any mechanistic attribution to CytoSorb. This case highlights the complexity of managing CRPA sepsis and ARDS in neutropenic AML patients, and the challenges in attributing observed clinical improvement to CytoSorb therapy in the context of multiple simultaneous interventions. The absence of cytokine assays (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha) precludes any mechanistic attribution of observed changes to cytokine adsorption, and interpretation should remain descriptive rather than causal. Observed transient changes occurred amid simultaneous interventions (broad-spectrum antibiotics, CRRT, prone ventilation, corticosteroids, and filgrastim), precluding attribution to any single therapy, including CytoSorb. Given the fatal outcome and persistent CRPA positivity, the clinical impact of this observation is limited, and the generalizability of a single-case report is restricted. Cautious interpretation is warranted, and CytoSorb may be considered as part of a comprehensive care bundle rather than as a standalone solution. Alternative tetracycline-based combinations were reviewed but not adopted under our center's salvage protocol for this XDR presentation. Future studies are warranted to clarify its clinical benefit and optimal timing in this population."

If not managed promptly, gallbladder perforation may lead to generalized biliary peritonitis, sepsis, and increased mortality. We report the case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who developed gallbladder empyema that progressed to free fundal perforation with associated biliary peritonitis. She was successfully treated with emergency open subtotal cholecystectomy. This case highlights the critical importance of early diagnosis and coordinated multidisciplinary intervention to prevent life-threatening outcomes."
41438836,Practice and attitudes of infection control staff towards diagnostic stewardship measures.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, diagnostic stewardship has gained importance worldwide as part of antibiotic stewardship and infection control programs. However, the specific involvement of infection control (IC) teams in this area has not been studied. METHOD: A volunteer survey of participants at the 2024 Freiburg Conference on Infection Prevention and Therapy was conducted to assess attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic stewardship. RESULTS: The majority of the 182 participants worked in German hospitals with established IC-committees (91.2%), antibiotic stewardship teams (43.4%), and laboratory commissions (24.7%).For sepsis diagnosis, at least two pairs of blood cultures are usually taken, which is in line with the guidelines; 14.3% use the ""six-pack"" rule (three pairs), and 28.6% take all cultures from one puncture site. For many clinical tests -except of stool tests and C-reactive protein - less than 50% rated their use as ""appropriate"", indicating a need for improvement. Interleukin 6 and beta-D-glucan are rarely used.Strategies such as reflex tests and cascade reporting are only used occasionally and are viewed with scepticism in some cases. Screening for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin resistant enterococci was rated as ""appropriate"" by over 60%, while screening for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria was rated as such by 50%. In the area of IC, 32.4% reported inadequate sampling of surfaces and 33.2% of staff hands. DISCUSSION: Subjective assessments and a heterogeneous participant structure limit the survey, and subgroup analyses are not possible due to the small number of cases. However, the results show chances for education and integration of IC teams in diagnostic stewardship programs."
41438721,Maternal Listeriosis Presenting With Suspected Meningitis in Late Pregnancy: A Case Report.,2025,"Maternal listeriosis is uncommon but clinically important due to the risk of severe maternal illness and adverse perinatal outcomes. Nonspecific symptoms often overlap with viral and respiratory illnesses, delaying diagnosis. We describe the case of a 28-year-old gravida 4 para 2+1 at 29+5 weeks who presented with fever, frontal headache, photophobia, and generalized myalgias. Significant medical history included asthma, chronic hypertension, chronic hepatitis B and C carriage, and a sickle cell variant. Blood cultures grew Listeria monocytogenes. She was treated with intravenous amoxicillin and gentamicin after initial empiric therapy. Despite concern for central nervous system involvement, brain MRI revealed no intracranial pathology. She transitioned to benzylpenicillin for outpatient therapy and achieved complete recovery. A healthy infant was delivered by emergency caesarean section at 39+1 weeks. Maternal listeriosis can closely mimic common viral illnesses. Thus, maintaining a high index of suspicion, especially in pregnant women with nonspecific febrile symptoms, can facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment, which is essential to optimising maternal and neonatal outcomes."
41438687,Updates on the role of miR-193b in the pathogenesis of human cancers and other diseases.,2026,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, fundamentally influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Among these, miR-193b has garnered significant attention as a potent tumor suppressor in some contexts, while functioning as an oncogene in other situations. Its frequent loss in some types of cancers such as gastric and cervical cancers as well as osteosarcoma positions it not only as a valuable prognostic indicator but also as a potential tool for gene therapy. On the other hand, it has been found to be up-regulated in esophageal and bladder cancers. Meanwhile, data regarding its expression pattern in some types of cancers, such as colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers is conflicting. Moreover, its influence extends beyond oncology, implicating it in a diverse range of human diseases, including systemic sclerosis, aortic dissection, osteoarthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis and allergic rhinitis. However, miR-193b does not have a single, unified function; instead, its role is highly context-dependent, acting as either a protective molecule or a pathogenic driver depending on the specific tissue and disease. This review aims to consolidate the current updates on the role of miR-193b, detailing its molecular mechanisms, validated target genes, and its burgeoning potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in cancer and other pathological conditions."

His clinical status continued to decompensate until he ultimately succumbed to his disease."
41438280,Patterns and predictors of readmission among sepsis survivors in a tertiary emergency department in Ethiopia.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a leading cause of critical illness worldwide. Survivors often suffer long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments. Post-sepsis rehospitalization is common but poorly characterized in low-resource settings. We aimed to determine 30/90/180-day readmission rates and predictors after emergency sepsis in Addis Ababa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria (infection with >/=2-point rise in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]) admitted to a tertiary Ethiopian emergency department from 2019-2021. A modified SOFA score (five parameters) was used to define organ dysfunction, as has been validated for resource-limited settings. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease and malignancy), acute severity (modified SOFA, septic shock, intensive care unit admission), microbiology, antibiotic duration, and outcomes. Survivors were followed for 180 days for hospital readmissions at any site of suspected infection. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors independently associated with 180-day readmission. RESULTS: Of 110 sepsis patients, 39 (35.5%) died during index admission. Among 71 survivors, 32 (45.1%) were readmitted within 180 days (78.1% within 30 days; 15.6% days 31-90; 6.3% days 91-180). Infectious diagnoses accounted for 71.9% of readmissions (often recurrent pneumonia or urinary tract infection). Median time to first readmission was 16 days (interquartile range 5-41). Multivariable analysis showed higher odds of 180-day readmission in younger patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.53 per decade decrease in age, 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.87, P = 0.029), and lower odds in those with non-metastatic malignancy (adjusted OR 0.15, 0.03-0.75, P = 0.027) or longer index hospitalization (adjusted OR 0.31 per 5-day increase, 0.11-0.89, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of emergency sepsis survivors were readmitted within 180 days, predominantly within 30 days, and most readmissions were for infection. Predictors included younger age, malignancy status, and length of stay. These findings highlight the need for targeted discharge planning, antimicrobial stewardship, and early follow-up for high-risk patients in low-resource settings."
41438024,Prognostic value of the pan-immune-inflammation value for mortality in sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Its associated coagulopathy, known as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), significantly increases mortality risk. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), a composite biomarker reflecting systemic immune and inflammatory status, has been linked to prognosis in various diseases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of PIV in patients with SIC and to develop predictive models accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database and included 4554 patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patients were stratified into high- and low-PIV groups based on the median PIV, and clinical characteristics were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were employed to assess the association between PIV and patient outcomes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to identify key variables for constructing a nomogram model. Additionally, machine learning algorithms, including random forest, were applied to build and validate predictive models. RESULTS: Patients in the high-PIV group had significantly higher 30-day and 90-day mortality rates. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with lower PIVs had markedly better survival, and a nonlinear positive correlation was observed between PIV and mortality risk. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression identified 8 key variables, including Acute Physiology Score III, lactate, red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, acute kidney injury, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The nomogram based on these variables achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Among machine learning models, the random forest algorithm exhibited the best predictive performance, with areas under the curve of 0.837 and 0.947 in the training and validation sets, respectively. External validation using a real-world cohort from Xingtai People's Hospital further confirmed the association between elevated PIV and increased mortality and SIC, with consistent survival trends and nonlinear patterns observed in both Kaplan-Meier and restricted cubic spline analyses. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate PIV into the prognostic assessment of patients with SIC. The development of a visual nomogram and machine learning-based models provides clinicians with practical tools for early identification of patients at high risk for SIC, potentially aiding in the optimization of treatment strategies."
41437592,[Advances in the study of de-resuscitation in septic shock].,2025,"The initial management of septic shock necessitates adequate fluid resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion. However, excessive or sustained fluid administration may precipitate fluid accumulation syndrome (FAS), significantly exacerbating the risk of organ dysfunction and mortality. Consequently, proactive prevention and management of FAS are paramount for optimizing patient outcomes. With the continuous optimization of fluid resuscitation strategies in the treatment of septic shock, de-resuscitation, as a key stage for preventing or correcting FAS, provides an important opportunity to improve patient prognosis. Recent studies have shown that during the later phase of septic shock resuscitation, active de-resuscitation combined with hemodynamic monitoring, adjustment of vasoactive drugs and other comprehensive intervention measures can help reduce fluid positive balance, lower the risk of organ dysfunction, shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and improve patient prognosis. Currently, the timing of de-resuscitation, volume assessment methods, the development of individualized treatment protocols, and the prevention and control of related complications have become the focus of research, while the search for reliable biomarkers to guide de-resuscitation strategies will become a future hot direction. In this article, we review the pathophysiology and clinical diagnosis of FAS, as well as the clinical strategies, controversies and challenges of de-resuscitation in septic shock, and explore the future research directions of de-resuscitation strategies, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and practical guidance for optimizing fluid management in patients with septic shock."
41437584,[Alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites of sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome based on 16S rDNA and untargeted metabolomics sequencing analysis].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of gut microbiota and metabolites between sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by using 16S rDNA and untargeted metabolomics sequencing analysis. METHODS: Patients with sepsis admitted to general intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2024 to May 2024 were enrolled. They were divided into ARDS group and non-ARDS group according to whether ARDS was present at admission. Clinical data were collected, and the fecal samples within 24 hours after diagnosis of sepsis were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. The denoised sequences amplicon sequence variants were used for diversity analysis, species composition analysis and species difference analysis. The fecal samples were performed for untargeted metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to screen for differential metabolites and related pathways. Finally, the joint analysis of differential gut microbiota and metabolites was conducted. RESULTS: Finally, 38 sepsis patients were included, including 15 cases with concomitant ARDS. Compared with the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group had significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), and C-reactive protein level. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that at the phylum level, the ARDS group was mainly composed of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota, while the non-ARDS group was mainly composed of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobiota. At the genus level, the ARDS group was mainly composed of Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, while the non-ARDS group was mainly composed of Enterococcus, Akkermansia and Ligilactobacillus. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the abundance of Klebsiella and Anaerofilum in the ARDS group significantly increased, while the abundance of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Akkermansia and Ruminococcus in the ARDS group significantly decreased. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the levels of metabolites such as nicotinamide N-oxide, uridine and N-acetyl-arginine were significantly up-regulated in the ARDS group, while the levels of metabolites such as lysine, ornithine, N-acetylaspartic acid and alanylalanine were significantly down-regulated in the ARDS group. The metabolic pathway analysis showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the differentially expressed metabolites in the ARDS group were mainly enriched in the pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, lysinedegradation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. The joint analysis indicated that Klebsiella were positively correlated with metabolites such as nicotinamide N-oxide and N-acetyl-arginine. Enterococcus were positively correlated with metabolites such as lysine and ornithine, and negatively correlated with nicotinamide N-oxide. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of beneficial bacteria in the gut of sepsis patients with ARDS further decreased, while the abundance of opportunistic pathogens further increased, which in turn affected the levels of related metabolites."

41436952,Quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines for sepsis and variations in recommendations.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To provide a clinical reference, we assessed the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for sepsis management in adults and compared their key recommendations. METHODS: Relevant CPGs for adult sepsis management were identified through searches of electronic databases, guideline repositories, and professional societies from January 1, 2018, to March 1, 2025. The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-Recommendation Excellence (AGREE-REX) were used to evaluate the methodological quality of CPGs and the quality of recommendations. Key recommendations were comprehensively extracted and compared. RESULTS: A total of 11 CPGs were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) scores for AGREE II domain were: scope and purpose, 88.89% (77.78-94.44%); stakeholder involvement, 83.33% (50.00-88.89%); rigor of development, 58.33% (50.00-83.33%); clarity of presentation, 94.40% (88.89-94.44%); applicability, 45.83% (33.33-66.67%); and editorial independence, 66.67% (58.33-91.67%). The AGREE-REX assessment indicated clinical applicability at 70.83% (63.89-83.33%), implementability at 58.33% (47.92-64.58%), and values and preferences at 30.21% (25.00-39.58%). In total, 552 key recommendations were extracted. Among guidelines utilizing the GRADE system, the proportion of evidence categorized as low (Grade C; n = 97, 40.93%) and very low quality (Grade D; n = 66, 27.85%) was substantially higher than that of high (Grade A; n = 15, 6.33%) and moderate-quality (Grade B; n = 59, 24.89%) evidence. Furthermore, weak recommendations (n = 168, 70.89%) were markedly more prevalent than strong recommendations (n = 69, 29.11%). Although guidelines for sepsis diagnosis were generally consistent, evidence gaps in hemodynamic management and antibiotic use led to controversial recommendations. CONCLUSION: Treatment strategies for sepsis vary across guidelines and remain inconsistent. The quality of CPGs for sepsis management requires improvement, particularly in applicability and values and preferences. Future CPG developers should adhere strictly to standardized methodologies and focus on enhancing the dissemination and implementation of guidelines. In this study, we lay the foundation for future guideline development, aiming to synthesize evidence-based insights for clinical decision-making.

41436719,Acute kidney injury prediction and prognostication using machine learning.,2025,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a major health concern with high costs and poor outcomes, partly due to late diagnosis. This paper reviews the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to overcome these limitations by enabling earlier and more accurate prediction and prognostication of AKI. Many studies on AI and ML models used to predict and prognosticate AKI were included in the review. The focus was on models that analyze complex datasets, including real-time data streams like novel biomarkers and continuous vital signs, to achieve earlier and more accurate predictions than conventional methods. ML models show high predictive accuracy for AKI onset and outcomes across various clinical settings, including intensive care units, sepsis, and postoperative and postcontrast situations, with key findings like the successful integration of real-time data to reflect the evolving nature of kidney injury. AI and ML offer a powerful, proactive solution for AKI management. By leveraging diverse data, these technologies can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. While their promising performance warrants further exploration, successful clinical integration will require user-friendly platforms and continued validation."
41436269,Evaluation of the performance and safety of adding the iron chelator MEX-CD1 to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis for removing excess labile iron in intensive care patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury - the Iron in Intensive Care trial (IRON-I.C.): protocol for a phase I-II randomised crossover pilot study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is common in intensive care and is linked to high morbidity and mortality, yet no specific therapy exists beyond supportive care. Excess circulating labile iron contributes to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death via ferroptosis. We hypothesise that targeted removal of labile iron during dialysis may reduce this pathogenic process. This study will evaluate the performance and safety of adding a novel iron chelator named MEX-CD1 (Metal EXtraction - Chitosan DOTAGA 1) to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised, open-label, crossover phase I-II pilot study in the intensive care unit of Nimes University Hospital, France. 14 adult patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy will receive two consecutive 24-hour CVVHD sessions: one with standard dialysate and one with dialysate supplemented with MEX-CD1 at 50 mg/L. Each patient serves as their own control. The primary outcome is the iron concentration in the effluent to measure iron removal performance. Secondary outcomes include plasma iron clearance, trace element loss, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and safety outcomes monitored up to 28 days. Statistical analyses will use paired tests and mixed linear regression models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Comite de Protection des Personnes (no. 25.01220.000448) and the French National Agency for Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (no. 2024-A01530-47). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT07236463."
41436209,Extensive arterial and venous thrombosis revealing lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with managed comorbidities.,2025,"We present a case of a female in her late 40s with a 5-year history of well-managed type II diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented with acute severe abdominal pain, vomiting and loose stools. Clinical assessment revealed sepsis and metabolic acidosis. Imaging demonstrated extensive arterial and venous thrombosis involving the superior mesenteric artery and vein, as well as the splenic vein. Emergency laparotomy was performed on the same day, revealing gangrenous bowel from the distal jejunum to the mid-transverse colon, necessitating resection and stoma creation. Postoperative management included anticoagulation. Given the unusual presentation of extensive thrombosis in a patient with low traditional risk factors, further investigation was pursued. Chest X-ray and High-resolution CT of the thorax revealed a right lower lobe mass with multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy confirmed primary lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 and CK7 positive). Subsequent positron emission tomography-CT showed widespread metastasis, and the patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy and later underwent jejunocolic anastomosis. This unique case highlights how extensive mesenteric thrombosis can be the initial manifestation of previously undiagnosed lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with otherwise well-managed comorbidities. It underscores the critical importance of considering underlying malignancy in the differential diagnosis of acute thromboembolic events to facilitate early diagnosis and potentially improve patient outcomes."
41433510,Incidence and factors associated with rapid blood culture sterilization among patients receiving ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia.,2026,"Ertapenem combination therapy has been shown to expedite the time to blood culture sterilization among patients with MSSA bacteremia. The purpose of this study was to define what proportion of patients sterilizes blood cultures within 72 h of ertapenem combination treatment initiation. This was a retrospective, multicenter study of patients who received ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia. Patients were considered to have rapid blood culture sterilization if blood cultures were negative within 72 h of ertapenem initiation and delayed blood culture sterilization if blood cultures remained positive after 72 h of ertapenem initiation. Of the 304 patients with MSSA bacteremia who received ertapenem for combination treatment, 197 met the inclusion criteria. The median (IQR) time to ertapenem initiation from the time of blood culture obtainment was 4 (3-5) days, and 47% (93/197) had definitive endocarditis. Overall, 85% (167/197) had rapid blood culture sterilization. Patients who had delayed blood culture sterilization had a trend toward a higher Pitt Bacteremia Score at the time of blood culture obtainment (2 [0-4] vs 1 [0-2], P = 0.091) and were more likely to have an oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration of >/=0.5 microg/mL (67% vs 43%, P = 0.015) compared to those with rapid blood culture sterilization. In this large study of patients who received ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia, 85% of patients sterilized their blood cultures within 72 h of treatment. These results suggest that a standard 3-day ertapenem course could be a reasonable stewardship strategy for patients initiated on combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia."
41433402,A short antimicrobial peptides family demonstrates efficacy to infection via a multimodal mechanism of action.,2026,"The escalating threat posed by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative ""superbugs"" has intensified. Short antimicrobial peptides (SAMPs) have emerged as promising therapeutics with sustained potency and cost-effectiveness against drug-resistant infections. Here, we report a family of 15-residue SAMPs derived through modifying related amino acids of Kassporin-KS1 (FA), utilizing database-filtering technology to identify the most probable structural parameters related to Gram-negative bacteria. Most SAMPs exhibit sub-muM antimicrobial activity with reliable stability and low toxicity. Notably, KR and RK demonstrate significant efficacy in combating biofilms and sepsis infections in vivo. Furthermore, the acquisition of resistance by strains to SAMPs was not observed, primarily due to the multimodal antimicrobial mechanisms of SAMPs. We revealed that the multimodal mechanisms of SAMPs encompass unregulated membrane destabilization, induction of apoptotic-like death pathway, and interference with normal physiological processes. Overall, the rational design strategies proposed herein can be implemented to develop potent antimicrobial agents targeting MDR bacteria."
41433302,Lycopene inhibits ER stress and apoptosis while modulating PI3K/AKT and enhancing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic proteins.,2025,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical clinical syndrome with limited therapeutic options. This study investigated the renoprotective effects of lycopene, a potent antioxidant, in both in vivo and in vitro AKI models. In a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis-AKI model, pretreatment with lycopene (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated renal histopathological damage (HE staining) and restored serum biomarkers (AST, ALT, BUN, CREA). Mechanistically, lycopene suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/Akt axis: it significantly reversed the CLP-induced upregulating of p-PI3K and p-Akt, and the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3), while increasing Nrf 2 and SOD1. Consistent results were observed in LPS- and H(2)O(2)-induced cellular AKI models, where lycopene attenuated cell death and restored redox homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence assays further validated these trends. Crucially, PI3K siRNA or cDNA transfection experiments confirmed that lycopene's antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects were PI3K-dependent. Our findings highlight lycopene as a promising therapeutic agent for AKI, acting via PI3K/Akt-mediated activation of Nrf 2 to counteract oxidative damage and apoptosis. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lycopene's renoprotection and supports its potential clinical translation for sepsis or oxidative stress-associated AKI."
41432766,"Trends of incidence, management and outcome of renal trauma in Germany (2008-2022): an analysis based on the TraumaRegister DGU(R).",2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In prior times surgical treatment was the standard treatment of severe renal injuries while nowadays there is an increasing favor of conservative or interventional treatment. METHODS: Data retrieved from the TraumaRegister DGU(R) included 138,447 trauma patients (Max. AIS >/= 3) in Germany from 2008 to 2022. KEY FINDINGS: The incidence of kidney trauma decreased from 3.8% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2022 (p < 0.001). Higher grades of renal injury were associated with increased risks of kidney and multiorgan failure (AAST II: 29.0%; AAST V: 51.5%), dialysis (AAST II: 5%; AAST V: 18.9%), sepsis (AAST II: 9.2%; AAST V: 15.8%) and in-hospital mortality (AAST II: 9.4%; AAST V: 32.8%). The rate of surgical treatment remained constant with about 20%. The strongest predictor for operative treatment was AAST severity (reference: AAST grade II): Odds ratio for grade III was 4.50 (95% confidence interval 3.63-5.58, for grade IV 24.6 (19.1-31.8), and for grade V 58.9 (39.7-87.4). Further predictive factors were other abdominal injuries and the need for blood transfusions. Partial or radical nephrectomy was predominantly performed in high-grade renal injuries, with 62.1% (n = 36) in AAST V and 25.0% (n = 26) in other high-grade traumas. Interventional bleeding control was most frequent in AAST III (21.7%, n = 13) and AAST IV (19.2%, n = 20). CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of renal injuries has slightly declined, the rate of surgical interventions remains unchanged. Factors favoring surgery included hemodynamic instability and further abdominal trauma. Nephrectomies were mainly performed in high-grade renal trauma, while interventional bleeding control was more frequent in lower AAST grades."
41432632,Histone H3 may be More Closely Associated with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation and Multiple Organ Failure Than HMGB1.,2025,"BackgroundAmong damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the specific contributions of histone and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between two DAMP markers, plasma histone H3 and HMGB1 levels, and concurrent DIC and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in critically ill patients.MethodsPlasma levels of histone H3 and HMGB1 were prospectively quantified in 46 critically ill patients who demonstrated systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possible sepsis, and required intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. We analyzed two DAMP marker values, various plasma-inflammatory and non-inflammatory cytokine levels, acute DIC on ICU day 3, and the maximum SOFA score at 48 h after ICU admission.ResultsOn ICU day 3, 25 patients had DIC while 21 did not. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma histone H3 levels (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.17 [1.02- 1.49], p = 0.008) and TNF-alpha (1.006 [1.001- 1.014], p = 0.007) were significant independent factors of DIC pathogenesis. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for the maximum SOFA score were 0.664, 0.602, 0.348, and 0.221 for IL-8, IL-6, histone H3, and HMGB1, respectively.ConclusionIn the early phase requiring intensive care, histone H3 levels exhibited a more positive association with the onset of DIC than HMGB1. Conversely, inflammatory cytokines may exert a more substantial influence on the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure in comparison to DAMPs."
41432474,Antifungal susceptibility of non-albicans Candida species from blood samples.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have emerged as a notable cause of both healthcare-associated and opportunistic infections. Compared with Candida albicans, NAC species are more likely to cause infections fraught with antifungal resistance issues and higher mortality rates. The objectives of this study were to identify the various Candida species causing candidaemia in a Malaysian general hospital and to ascertain their antifungal susceptibility profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 15-month cross-sectional study involved the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with candidaemia. Conclusive species identification was achieved through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) while antifungal susceptibility was performed using the colourimetric broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 118 non-duplicate Candida isolates were analysed during the study period. Out of this total, 47 (39.8%) were C. albicans, 25 (21.2%) were Candida parapsilosis complex, 24 (20.3%) were Candida tropicalis, 19 (16.1%) were Nakaseomyces glabratus and three (2.6%) were Pichia kudriavzevii. Collectively, the NAC species outnumbered C. albicans (60.2% vs. 39.8%). The overall minimal inhibitory concentration at which >/=90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90) for NAC species was 32 microg/mL for fluconazole, 1 microg/mL for amphotericin B and between 1 to 2 microg/mL for the echinocandins. CONCLUSION: Despite C. albicans being the single most frequently isolated species from patients with candidaemia, more than half of candidaemia cases in our centre were caused by NAC species. Generally, although these NAC species were not fluconazole-susceptible, amphotericin B and echinocandins may still be utilised against them."
41432367,Bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis from asymptomatic Aspergillus niger fungal infective endocarditis in the immunosuppressed patient: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis (EFE) is a rare but sight- and life-threatening condition that often arises in immunocompromised patients. While Aspergillus fumigatus is the predominant pathogen, Aspergillus niger-associated endocarditis leading to bilateral EFE has not been previously reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old woman with a history of two renal transplants over the past 30 years, along with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, presented with rapidly progressive bilateral visual impairment, beginning with acute vision loss and ocular pain in the right eye, followed by involvement of the left eye within two days. She had no systemic symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: Initial aqueous humor analysis, including Gram staining, fungal culture, and viral PCR, yielded negative results. As the disease progressed to bilateral involvement within 2 days, a diagnostic vitrectomy was performed. Vitreous sampling demonstrated fungal hyphae, and culture confirmed Aspergillus niger. Transesophageal echocardiography further revealed mitral valve vegetation, establishing the diagnosis of fungal infective endocarditis with bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received empiric intravitreal antibiotics and antivirals initially, followed by diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and systemic antifungal therapy after identification of Aspergillus. Mitral valve replacement surgery was subsequently performed. OUTCOMES: Despite surgical intervention and systemic antifungal treatment, the patient developed disseminated fungal sepsis and died 2 weeks after valve replacement. LESSONS: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of EFE and emphasizes the importance of considering fungal endocarditis as a source of infection in immunosuppressed patients presenting with severe vitritis, even in the absence of systemic symptoms. Early recognition, prompt vitrectomy with intravitreal antifungal therapy, and thorough systemic evaluation are essential to improve visual and systemic outcomes."
41432366,Association of serum calcium levels within the first hour of ER admission with 28-day mortality in sepsis: A retrospective ICU analysis.,2025,"Sepsis poses a global health challenge, necessitating effective predictors for risk stratification and timely intervention. Serum calcium, involved in vital physiological processes, has shown potential associations with sepsis outcomes, but the evidence remains limited and conflicting. This retrospective study included 1000 sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Serum calcium levels were measured within 1 hour of emergency room (ER) admission. Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and severity scores, were collected. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to assess the association between serum calcium levels and 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed the effect of serum calcium on 28-day survival. Lower serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission were significantly associated with higher 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.1097, 95% CI: 0.04024-0.2912, P < .0001), even after adjusting for confounders. The area under the curve for serum calcium in predicting 28-day mortality was 0.5885 (P < .0001). Combining serum calcium with other predictors, such as the Charlson comorbidity index, red cell distribution width, lactic acid levels, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, improved predictive accuracy (area under the curve: 0.7245, P < .0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant association between lower serum calcium levels and reduced 28-day survival (P < .0001). Low serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission are significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. It complements existing predictors, showcasing its potential role in a comprehensive prognostic framework."
41432140,Serum Symmetric Dimethylarginine as a Predictor of Toxicity of Carboplatin in Dogs.,2026,"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) predicts carboplatin clearance and myelotoxicity in humans and cats. This relationship is unknown in dogs. In canines, elevated serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) correlates with reduced GFR. This study prospectively evaluated whether dogs with elevated SDMA (> 14 mug/dL) are at increased risk of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity following carboplatin chemotherapy. Plasma samples were collected to determine if SDMA or other factors are significant determinants of carboplatin pharmacokinetics. Thirty client-owned dogs weighing > 15 kg with confirmed neoplasia were enrolled. Dogs received carboplatin intravenously (300 mg/m(2)). SDMA was measured on the day of treatment. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was done to identify possible covariates affecting pharmacokinetic parameters. Adverse effects were monitored with weekly complete blood counts and owner assessment forms. Five dogs had elevated SDMA; four had significantly reduced carboplatin clearance (mean 93.9, range 76.1-116.8 mL/h/kg) compared with dogs with SDMA </= 14 mug/dL (mean 185.4, range 114.3-268.3 mL/h/kg, p < 0.001). Three dogs with elevated SDMA experienced grade 4 neutropenia; one was euthanized due to sepsis. Two additional dogs with elevated SDMA were euthanized 5- and 13-days post treatment due to severe gastrointestinal signs. Twenty-five dogs had SDMA </= 14 mug/dL: 10 had asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 3 had grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity, and none died. Elevated SDMA was associated with decreased carboplatin clearance in dogs and predicted risk for treatment-related toxicity and death in our study population."
41431914,Calcific Uremic Panniculitis: A Rare Form of Calciphylaxis in an Endstage Renal Disease Patient.,2025,"Calcific uremic panniculitis is a rare cutaneous calcinosis on the spectrum of calciphylaxis. It mainly affects patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The mortality rate is high, approaching 50% of cases. We report the case of a patient on chronic hemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism who developed calcific panniculitis. The diagnosis was clinical: bluish subcutaneous nodules in the abdomen with rapid extension to the lower limbs and even the back, which quickly became necrotic. X-rays of the abdomen and lower limbs showed rounded calcifications in the fatty tissue. The evolution was rapidly fatal and the patient died of septic shock following superimposed infection of the lesions. Calcific uremic panniculitis is an increasingly rare fatal complication associated with ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The treatment remains poorly understood and difficult to apply, hence the importance of preventing this complication."
41431771,"Rare Case of Campylobacter jejuni Bacteremia in a Pediatric Patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Clinical Management, Pathophysiology, and Public Health Implications.",2025,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide; however, systemic infections such as bacteremia remain rare, particularly in immunocompetent individuals. This case report presents a rare instance of C. jejuni bacteremia in a 12-year-old girl undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), emphasizing the increased vulnerability of immunocompromised pediatric patients. The patient was admitted with febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. Blood cultures taken at admission signaled positive after 90 hours, and the isolate was identified as C. jejuni using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed sensitivity to erythromycin, which led to successful treatment and recovery following a 10-day antibiotic course. The case illustrates the pathophysiological role of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and mucosal barrier damage in facilitating bacterial translocation and systemic infection. It also highlights diagnostic challenges due to the fastidious nature and slow growth of the organism, reinforcing the importance of rapid diagnostic tools and targeted therapy based on susceptibility results. In an era of rising antimicrobial resistance and growing populations of immunocompromised patients, this report underscores the critical need for heightened clinical awareness, robust laboratory support, and preventive public health strategies to mitigate the risk of severe Campylobacter infections in vulnerable groups."
41431768,Evaluation of the distribution and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bloodstream infection isolates of patients hospitalised in a tertiary care centre in western Turkey.,2025,"This study aims to evaluate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance profiles of microorganisms isolated from blood cultures of patients hospitalised in intensive care units and wards of our hospital over a 2-year period, in light of European antimicrobial resistance data and country surveillance data. Blood cultures sent to the microbiology laboratory from the wards and intensive care units of our hospital between December 2020 and 2022 were retrospectively evaluated from the hospital automation system. The identification and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were done by the Phoenix 100 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The results of antibiotic susceptibility were evaluated according to the criteria of the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The blood culture results of 872 patients with pathogenic bacterial growth in their blood cultures were examined and evaluated. Taking into account World Health Organisation (WHO) surveillance reports, it appears that our hospital's antimicrobial resistance rates were higher than those reported by our country's data. Resistance profiles vary from country to country, city to city, and even among different hospitals in the same city. Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, even at the hospital level, will contribute to programs to combat antimicrobial resistance both across the country and all around the world."
41431373,How to screen and provide rapid initial treatment for sepsis in adult patients.,2026,"Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition in which a dysregulated host response to infection causes organ dysfunction, potentially leading to death. It is a time-critical condition, so early recognition of deterioration potentially due to sepsis, escalation to a senior clinician and rapid initial treatment are key for improving outcomes and saving lives. Nurses screening patients for sepsis must have the knowledge and skills required to do so effectively, working within their level of competence. * Sepsis is a life-threatening and time-critical condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. * To ensure comprehensive and accurate screening, it is recommended to use an early warning score observation chart and a sepsis screening tool. * The 'sepsis six' is a bundle of six activities that must be carried out to improve patient outcomes when sepsis is suspected. REFLECTIVE ACTIVITY: 'How to' articles can help to update your practice and ensure it remains evidence-based. Apply this article to your practice. Reflect on and write a short account of: * How this article might improve your practice when screening and providing rapid initial treatment for sepsis in adults. * How you could use this information to educate nursing students or colleagues about screening and providing rapid initial treatment for sepsis in adults."
41431092,Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia in an AIDS patient during pregnancy: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Pregnancy complicated by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can result in a dual state of immune suppression, significantly increasing susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), a placenta-tropic lethal pathogen, is extremely rare in pregnant women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, when it does occur, it often leads to maternal sepsis, premature birth, or fetal death. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 36+(2)-week pregnant woman who presented with a 4-day history of persistent fever and was known to be HIV-positive. Laboratory tests indicated an elevated neutrophil percentage and an increased C-reactive protein level. Imaging studies revealed bilateral renal hydronephrosis. Blood culture confirmed a L. monocytogenes infection, identified with 99% confidence by Vitek2. DIAGNOSIS: When pregnant women who are HIV-positive experience unexplained fever, there should be a heightened alert for potential opportunistic infections, such as Listeria. It is recommended that blood cultures and molecular testing be conducted within 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Due to the patient's allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, a breakthrough treatment regimen consisting of linezolid combined with imipenem and cilastatin was selected. OUTCOMES: After 3 days of treatment, the patient's temperature returned to normal, and both the mother and the infant were discharged in good health. LESSONS: HIV infection during pregnancy, when complicated by L. monocytogenes bacteremia, is extremely rare; however, it carries a very high mortality rate. This case study represents one of the few documented instances of HIV infection complicated by L. monocytogenes bacteremia during pregnancy. It underscores the necessity for clinicians to enhance early detection and implement precise interventions for these rare co-infections to optimize maternal and infant outcomes."
41431014,Impact of emergency department-to-intensive care unit transfer time on in-hospital mortality: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"We evaluated whether emergency department (ED)-to-intensive care unit (ICU) transfer time is associated with in-hospital mortality among adults admitted with ICU-level indications, using a prespecified 4-hour quality threshold. In this retrospective cohort from a tertiary academic hospital (January-December 2023), we analyzed 376 adults admitted to the ICU from the ED. Demographics, comorbidities, primary diagnoses, laboratory markers, and ED process metrics were extracted. ED length of stay (ED-LOS) was examined continuously and categorically (</=4 vs >4 hours). Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality. Overall in-hospital mortality was 54.3%. Median ED-LOS was 194 minutes in survivors versus 220 minutes in non-survivors. While continuous ED-LOS was not significantly different between groups, ED-LOS > 4 hours was independently associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.82; P = .01). Additional predictors included advanced age, sepsis diagnosis, low serum albumin, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II >/= 35; presentation during daytime hours was associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.97; P = .04). ED-to-ICU transfer delays > 4 hours are independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. While timely ICU admission is critical, optimizing care during ED boarding may mitigate risk. These findings support system-level interventions targeting ICU transfer within 4 hours for critically ill patients."
41430966,"Klebsiella pneumonia liver abscess causing bacteremia, pneumonia, and secondary brain abscess: A case report.",2025,"RATIONALE: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) can cause an invasive syndrome characterized by multi-organ abscesses. While liver abscess and bacteremia are common, secondary brain abscess is a rare but life-threatening complication. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in managing such severe KPIS cases and to emphasize key management strategies that can lead to successful outcomes, thereby enhancing clinician awareness of this complex syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 37-year-old male presented with fever and altered mental status, which subsequently progressed to septic shock and hypoxemia, requiring intensive care. DIAGNOSES: KPIS with liver abscess, bacteremia, pneumonia, and secondary brain abscess due to hvKp infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received meropenem via extended infusion, fluid resuscitation, glycemic control, and supportive care. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition improved significantly within 5 days of targeted therapy, manifested by the resolution of fever, successful extubation, and normalization of key laboratory parameters (including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin). He was discharged from the ICU after 15 days, exhibiting only mild residual right-sided weakness. Crucially, follow-up imaging at 3 months revealed complete resolution of the liver and brain abscesses, with no evidence of recurrence. LESSONS: This case underscores the importance of early recognition, aggressive antimicrobial therapy, glycemic control, and the utility of next-generation sequencing in diagnosing hvKp infections. Strict glycemic management and susceptibility-guided therapy are critical to preventing complications and improving outcomes."
41430733,Systematic review and meta-analysis of humoral immunity proteins and mortality in sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Humoral immunity proteins-immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides-have key antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions in sepsis. We hypothesised that their circulating levels are lower in non-survivors, potentially resulting in impaired bacterial clearance and persistent or recurrent infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating differences in humoral immunity proteins between survivors and non-survivors in adult patients with sepsis. PubMed and Embase were searched without date restrictions. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analyses included data from the MIMIC-IV ICU database, and further supplemented by three proteomic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies including 6,330 patients were analysed. Thirteen reported on immunoglobulins, 17 on complement proteins, and 7 on the antimicrobial peptide heparin-binding protein (HBP). Survivors had significantly higher levels of complement proteins C3 (SMD 0.53 [0.07-0.99]) and C4 (SMD 0.51 [0.09-0.94]) compared to non-survivors. Conversely, C4a (SMD - 1.17 [-1.77 to - 0.56]) and IgA (SMD - 0.21 [-0.39 to - 0.03]) were significantly lower in survivors. No differences were found for IgG (SMD 0.00 [-0.18 to 0.18]), IgM (SMD - 0.02 [-0.13 to 0.08]), C5, C5a, or HBP. Sensitivity analyses using MIMIC-IV (n = 2,452) and proteomic datasets supported these findings. Proteomic data revealed early depletion of classical complement components (C3, C4B) and regulatory proteins in non-survivors. CONCLUSION: Sepsis non-survivors exhibit lower C3 and C4 levels and higher C4a, consistent with complement activation and/or depletion. Complement proteins may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in sepsis."
41430585,HELLP syndrome as a major contributor to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes among preeclamptic women: findings from a multicenter retrospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: HELLP syndrome, a severe complication of preeclampsia, is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in preeclamptic women with and without HELLP syndrome in Indonesia. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted across 30 hospitals in Indonesia from January 2022 to December 2023. Data from 1,808 preeclamptic women were analyzed, with 219 (12.1%) classified as having HELLP syndrome. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between the HELLP and non-HELLP groups. RESULTS: Women with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher risks of severe complications, including eclampsia (p < 0.001; aOR: 2.5 (1.5-4.18)), acute kidney injury (p < 0.01; aOR: 4.11 (2.07-8.15)), emergency hypertension (p = 0.048; aOR: 1.42 (1.01-2.01)), preterm birth < 37 weeks (p = 0.013; aOR: 1.54 (1.1-2.17)), and preterm birth < 34 weeks (p < 0.001; aOR: 1.8 (1.28-2.53)). HELLP syndrome increased the risk of Intra-uterine fetal death (p = 0.01; aOR: 2.18 (1.21-3.95)) and neonatal sepsis (p = 0.011; aOR: 2.32 (1.21-4.42)). Although the multivariate analysis did not yield any significant results, the HELLP syndrome group has a substantially higher prevalence of maternal death (3.7% vs 1%; p = 0.005) and neonatal death (11.6% vs 6.4%; p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: HELLP syndrome significantly worsens maternal and neonatal outcomes in preeclampsia, reflecting a need for improved early detection of 'high-risk' preeclamptic women like sFlt1/PLGF ratio and perhaps other laboratory tests like haptoglobin and D-dimer's. Many of these laboratory tests are currently not accessible in the Indonesian public health sector. Further research is needed to identify other markers that would assist in a more timely diagnosis of impending HELLP syndrome, particularly in early-onset preeclampsia patients managed conservatively."
41430584,The value of pathogen DNA load in evaluating the efficacy of bloodstream infection: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is increasingly being applied in clinical practice, with absolute quantification as one of its key advantages. This study aims to explore the significance of pathogen DNA load in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of bloodstream infection (BSI). METHODS: A total of 25 hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection were enrolled as research subjects. These patients were confirmed by ddPCR testing in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Fuyang People's Hospital, and admitted between November 2024 and April 2025. All patients showed clinical improvement after treatment and were discharged. Based on ddPCR results, they were divided into the Escherichia coli (E. coli) group (n=15) and the Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) group (n=10). Each patient underwent consecutive ddPCR testing three times, and data including general clinical information, laboratory test results, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were collected and analyzed. The study further aimed to investigate the value of dynamic changes in pathogen DNA load for evaluating efficacy of treatment in BSI and other potential clinical implications. RESULTS: Among the baseline data of two groups, the alanine aminotransferase（ALT）level in the K. pneumoniae group (52.8 U/L) was higher than that in the E. coli group (21.0U/L), and the medianl DNA load in the K.pneumoniae group(8329.2 copies/mL,[IQR]: 291.8-47722.4 copies/mL) was higher than that in the E. coli group (310.2 copies/mL,[IQR]: 129.0-1838.0 copies/mL). Meanwhile, Pearson correlation analysis showed no strong correlation between the initial DNA load and SOFA score in patients of the two groups. Dynamic observation indicated that the pathogen DNA load of BSI patients in both groups showed a decreasing trend; at the same time, the proportion of patients with normalized body temperature increased in each group. Further verification demonstrated a strong correlation between the changing trend of DNA load and C-reactive protein(CRP) as well as procalcitonin(PCT)(r ＞0.9).In addition, the rate of reduction in pathogen DNA load in the two groups was comparable to CRP and PCT. Finally, in the K. pneumoniae group, it was found when the DNA load cut-off value was set at 8329.23 copies/mL, it exhibited high sensitivity and high specificity for identifying the formation of secondary abscesses(AUC=1). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that DNA load levels of BSI vary significantly among different pathogens. More importantly, the dynamic changes in pathogen DNA load closely correlate with clinical outcomes, serving as a reliable and objective indicator to directly evaluate therapeutic efficacy in BSI patients. This highlights the practical clinical value of pathogen DNA load monitoring for real-time assessment of treatment response and optimization of clinical management strategies. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41430511,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill adult patients admitted with traumatic brain injury: a cohort study.,2025,"PURPOSE: We sought to describe the clinical features and outcomes of adult patients with traumatic brain injury in Ontario. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (April 2009 to March 2021) with a first episode of traumatic brain injury. To compare the long-term outcome trajectory after traumatic brain injury, we matched patients with traumatic brain injury 1:1 to patients who survived an intensive care unit admission with multisystem trauma but without traumatic brain injury. We measured in-hospital and long-term all-cause mortality; additional endpoints included 1) new psychiatric diagnosis, 2) epilepsy, 3) venous thromboembolic disease, and 4) sepsis. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Overall, we included 13,283 adult patients with traumatic brain injury. The mean age was 54 yr; 72% of patients were male. The most common pre-existing comorbidities were hypertension (39%) and cardiovascular disease (19%). Median follow-up was 5 years; 17% of patients with traumatic brain injury died during their initial hospital stay, and 16% died during long-term follow-up. Sepsis after hospital discharge occurred in 14% of patients; additional outcomes included new psychiatric diagnosis (7%), epilepsy (4%), and venous thromboembolic disease (2%). Surviving traumatic brain injury was associated with a higher hazard of epilepsy (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.99 to 2.95); the risk of other outcomes was similar or lower when compared with survivors without traumatic brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with traumatic brain injury have a high risk of in-hospital death. Those who survive the initial hospitalization are at risk of long-term outcomes including new epilepsy."
41430347,"Plasmodium knowlesi gametocyte carriage and load among malaria patients at Kapit Hospital in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.",2025,"The number of human infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite typically found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, have increased and P. knowlesi has become the sole cause of indigenous cases of malaria in Malaysia since 2018. The reasons for the increase are multifactorial and could include human-to-human transmission through mosquito bites. Such transmission would require viable gametocytes circulating in the blood of infected individuals as this is the only parasite blood stage transmissible to mosquitoes. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of P. knowlesi malaria patients with viable gametocytes and to determine the association between gametocyte load and duration of illness prior to hospital admission, and with total parasitaemia. The mRNA transcripts of pks25, a gene expressed in mature female P. knowlesi gametocytes, were measured by a real-time PCR assay in blood samples from 295 patients at Kapit Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo with PCR-confirmed single infections of P. knowlesi. Viable gametocytes were present in 67.5% (199/295) of patients. A positive correlation was seen between gametocyte load and total parasitaemia (rho = 0.32, p = 0.01), whereas there was no statistically significant association between gametocyte carriage and duration of illness prior to hospitalisation (rho = 0.28, p = 0.7). Forty (20%) of 199 gametocyte-positive samples had fewer than 500 pks25 transcript copies/microL, but 25 (12.5%) of 199 gametocyte-positive patients had elevated levels of gametocytes; 13 (10.8%) had between 10,001 and 100,000 and 12 (6%) had > 100,000 pks25 transcript copies/microL. Our findings demonstrate the presence of viable gametocytes in a substantial proportion of patients, including some with relatively high densities. This observation, taken together with other findings, underscores the potential of humans to serve as infectious hosts of P. knowlesi, but they do not constitute direct evidence of human-to-human transmission. Significant gaps still remain in our understanding of P. knowlesi gametocyte biology and infectivity. Addressing these gaps is essential to ascertain whether human-to-human transmission of P. knowlesi, which was experimentally demonstrated in the 1960s, occurs in natural settings. Continued surveillance of human P. knowlesi infections together with studies on gametocyte biology, vector bionomics, and monitoring of macaque host populations in relation to environmental alterations are vital to understand changes in the dynamics of P. knowlesi malaria transmission, and to inform strategies for its control and prevention."
41430158,EBV-Tonsillitis with superinfection involving Staphylococcus aureus and Prevotella Oris leading to life-threatening bleeding in a 13-year-old girl: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections of the upper airways are common in children and adolescents, often presenting with mild symptoms and typically resolving without the need for hospitalization. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gammaherpesvirus, can cause diverse clinical syndromes and transient immune dysregulation, potentially predisposing to bacterial superinfection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 13-year-old girl with critical upper airway obstruction due to necrotizing ulcerative oropharyngitis in the context of an EBV infection, with superinfection by Prevotella oris and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from operative tissue specimens. Within a very short time, the patient developed EBV-associated nephritis and pneumonia, severe sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extensive soft-tissue necrosis precipitated life-threatening hemorrhage from the right external carotid artery followed by a second hemorrhage on the left, requiring coil embolization and ligation. Additionally, the patient experienced neurological complications due to thiamine deficiency, contributing to a complex and prolonged recovery process. Despite the severity of her illness, multidisciplinary management enabled stabilization and eventually discharge to a rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, fulminant necrotizing oropharyngitis with bilateral external carotid hemorrhage during acute EBV infection in an immunocompetent adolescent is exceedingly rare. This highlights the importance of considering anaerobic oral colonizers as potential pathogens in maxillofacial infections. Clinicians should reassess for bacterial superinfection when EBV courses are protracted or deteriorating."
41430129,Risk stratification for CMV reactivation in sepsis patients: development of an interpretable machine learning model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in critically ill populations is associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model to predict CMV reactivation within 28 days of ICU admission in sepsis patients, providing a risk stratification tool to optimize clinical management. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from intensive care unit (ICU) patients meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria. Key clinical variables, including acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ(APACHE Ⅱscore), CMV IgG titer, CD4(+) lymphocyte count, and corticosteroid use duration, were selected through univariate logistic regression. Seven machine learning models were developed, with the gradient boosting machine (GBM) demonstrating superior performance. Model interpretability was enhanced using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to identify critical predictors and visualize feature contributions. RESULTS: Among 221 patients, 19.0% experienced CMV reactivation. The test set AUC values for GBM, logistic regression (LR), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were recorded as 0.761, 0.684, 0.673, 0.659, 0.65, 0.624, and 0.623, respectively. GBM model achieved the highest AUC in the test set, with robust calibration and net benefit of the GBM model in the test set exceeded that of the other models at threshold probabilities ranging from 10% to 60%. SHAP analysis identified the APACHE II score, corticosteroid use, CMV IgG levels, and CD4 + lymphocyte count as the top four important predictors. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated significant stratification between high- and low-risk groups (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This interpretable machine learning model provides accurate CMV reactivation prediction and clear insights into contributing factors.

41430122,Diagnostic and management challenges of a case of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency in a resource-limited healthcare setting in Tanzania: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism represent a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. These conditions are frequently missed in low-resource settings due to their anticipated rarity and similarity of symptoms to conditions such as sepsis. We present a case of a neonate with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency whose diagnosis and management at our facility were complicated by limited healthcare resources. CASE REPORT: A three-day-old male of South Asian origin born to consanguineous parents presented with lethargy, hypothermia and respiratory distress. He was initially managed for suspected septic shock. However, further investigations revealed severe hyperammonemia for which he was managed with peritoneal dialysis and oral sodium benzoate. His care was coordinated by a multidisciplinary team and included teleconsultation with a metabolic specialist. Once stabilized, he was transferred to our sister institution in Pakistan for further care where genetic analysis revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant (c.1306_1307insT; p.Thr439fs*52) in the N-acetylglutamate synthase gene, confirming the diagnosis of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. However, the baby passed away at 49th day of life. CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion is important in diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism. Even in resource-limited setting, a multidisciplinary team with international partnership can optimize the care for patients with rare inborn errors of metabolism. There is also a need to increase awareness, improve diagnostic capacity and establish standardized treatment protocols for rare metabolic disorders in low-resource settings like Tanzania."
41430080,Neutrophil-mediated delivery of hybrid cross-species nanovesicles for treatment of bacterial infections.,2025,"Hybrid vesicles are increasingly employed as nanocarrier systems for drug delivery owing to their versatile functionalities. This study presents a multifunctional vesicle delivery platform, designated PMB@LNV-SyBV, which integrates anti-inflammatory lemon-derived exosomes and attenuated bacterial vesicles to deliver polymyxin B (PMB). The incorporation of exogenous cholesterol enhances the drug-loading capacity of these vesicles. Antimicrobial assays confirm that PMB@LNV-SyBV effectively targets carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. By inheriting pathogen-associated molecular patterns from native bacteria, PMB@LNV-SyBV is efficiently recognized and internalized by neutrophils, enabling it to reach infection sites alongside neutrophil recruitment. Subsequently, the vesicles are released from neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli. In infection models involving Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced mouse pneumonia and K. pneumoniae/Escherichia coli-induced mouse bloodstream infections, PMB@LNV-SyBV significantly reduces bacterial load, modulates pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and increases sepsis survival rates. With its high yield and favorable biocompatibility, the multifunctional PMB@LNV-SyBV represents a promising therapeutic platform for the clinical management of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections."
41429144,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs in sepsis treatment: principles, impact, and future directions.",2026,"Sepsis continues to be a serious global health concern with increasing mortality rates owing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have emerged as critical tools for optimizing antibiotic use and reducing AMR. This review examines the applications of ASPs in sepsis treatment, highlights their role in improving patient outcomes, and addresses the challenges posed by multidrug-resistant organisms. The review begins by exploring the global AMR crisis and its implications for sepsis therapy and then evaluates the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's guidelines and their limitations in the context of growing AMR. The core principles of ASPs in sepsis treatment are also discussed. Data from international and Korean studies indicate that effective ASPs may improve patient outcomes; reduce the length of hospital stay; and reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated adverse events, healthcare costs, and AMR. However, diagnostic delays, staffing shortages, and inconsistent ASP implementation remain significant barriers. Furthermore, robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of ASPs in various patient populations with sepsis is required. This review concludes with the future directions for integrating rapid diagnostics, individualized treatment planning, and informatics. To ensure responsible antibiotic use in sepsis care in increasing resistance, investment in and engagement with ASPs must be increased."
41429071,C-reactive protein in adult sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases, without language or time restrictions. Studies involving adults at risk for, suspected of, or diagnosed with sepsis who underwent CRP measurement and reported diagnostic or prognostic accuracy data were eligible. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies were included. Risk of bias was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 tool, and the quality of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: A total of 3599 records were screened, and 22 studies (13,083 patients) met the inclusion criteria, 16 assessing diagnostic accuracy and 6 evaluating prognostic value. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity was 83 % (95 % CI 75 %-89 %) and specificity was 56 % (95 % CI 41 %-69 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 80.1 %) and a false-positive rate of 44.3 % (95 % CI 30.9 %‒58.6 %). In the prognostic analysis for mortality, the pooled sensitivity was 81 % (95 % CI 70 %-89 %) and the specificity was 77 % (95 % CI 64 %-86 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 65.9 %) and a false-positive rate of 22.8 % (95 % CI 13.6 %-35.6 %). Most studies presented a moderate to high risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence reveals high diagnostic uncertainty and limited prognostic accuracy of CRP in adults with sepsis. The low specificity and high error rates restrict the clinical utility of CRP for diagnostic or prognostic decision-making in sepsis management."
41427863,PANCREATIC STONE PROTEIN (PSP) AS AN EARLY PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKER OF OUTCOME IN CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a major healthcare-associated infection, leading to severe complications. Early identification of patients at high risk for unfavorable outcome remains challenging. Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) has emerged as a promising biomarker in sepsis; however, its role in CDI has not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of adult patients with CDI from 13 hospitals in Greece. PSP was measured within 24 hours of CDI onset. Primary outcome was the association between PSP and unfavorable outcome, defined as at least one of the following: organ failure, severe disease progression, relapse, or death. ROC curve was performed to assess diagnostic performance, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate independent predictors of adverse outcome. RESULTS: 147 patients were enrolled, and unfavorable outcome occurred in 52. PSP levels were significantly higher in these patients. PSP showed an AUC 0.648 (95% CI 0.550-0.746, p=0.003) for predicting adverse outcome and an optimal cut-off of 300 ng/mL, increased the risk significantly (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.822-7.638, p<0.001). C-reactive protein (CRP) was also associated with adverse outcome (AUC 0.619, 95% CI: 0.512-0.726, p: 0.03), with an optimal cut-off >/=90 mg/l. Combined elevation of PSP and CRP conferred stronger prognostic value (OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.78-17.85, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, PSP >/=300 ng/ml (p: 0.006) and CRP >/=90 mg/l (p:0.04) remained independently associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating PSP in CDI. PSP, especially combined with CRP, may serve as complementary biomarkers for early risk stratification."
41426991,Study on the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in neurocritical care patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common neurological complication in neurocritical care units, characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction without direct central nervous system infection. Early identification and prognosis assessment remain challenging due to the lack of specific diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of SAE in neurocritical care patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 200 neurocritical care patients with sepsis over a 2-year period. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed using sidestream dark field (SDF) videomicroscopy, measuring perfused vessel density (PVD), microvascular flow index (MFI), and perfused boundary region (PBR). Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring was performed for 72 h. Serum biomarkers including neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were measured at admission and serially. The primary outcome was the development of SAE, and secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and neurological function at 90 days. RESULTS: Among 200 patients, 134 (67%) developed SAE. Patients with SAE showed significantly reduced PVD (8.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 12.4 +/- 2.8 mm/mm(2), p < 0.001) and MFI (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001) compared to non-SAE patients. The combination of microcirculation parameters with EEG abnormalities yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) for predicting SAE. Early microcirculation-EEG patterns were strongly associated with 28-day mortality (HR: 3.45, 95% CI: 2.12-5.61, p < 0.001) and poor neurological outcomes at 90 days. CONCLUSION: The combination of early microcirculation perfusion indicators with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring provides excellent predictive value for SAE occurrence and prognosis in neurocritical care patients. This multimodal approach may facilitate early identification and risk stratification."
41426760,Perforated Jejunal Diverticulitis: A Retrospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Jejunal diverticulitis is a rare but clinically significant cause of abdominal pain that often mimics other intra-abdominal conditions and carries a risk of serious complications, including perforation. Management strategies have varied between conservative treatment with antibiotics and surgical resection, but evidence has remained limited, particularly in small case series. METHODS: A single-centre, retrospective observational study was conducted at the Royal Stoke University Hospital (UK). Patients diagnosed with jejunal diverticular perforation (JDP) between January 2012 and March 2025 were identified from the electronic patient record system. Data on demographics, presentation, imaging, treatment, complications, and outcomes were collected. Statistical analysis included descriptive summaries and exploratory comparisons between surgical and conservative management groups using Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included (mean age 71.5 +/- 14.8 years; 75% male). All had undergone contrast-enhanced CT, which demonstrated jejunal diverticulitis with features of perforation in every case. Seven patients (58.3%) were managed surgically, most commonly with segmental jejunal resection and primary anastomosis, while five patients (41.7%) were treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care. Complications occurred in 42.9% of surgical cases and 40.0% of conservative cases, and no mortality was observed in either group. CONCLUSION: Jejunal diverticulitis with perforation was an uncommon but important diagnosis that required early recognition and CT imaging for confirmation. Both conservative and surgical management strategies achieved favourable outcomes, and treatment should be guided by clinical stability, response to antibiotics, and suitability for surgery."
41426368,The utility of C-reactive protein in neonatal early-onset sepsis screening: A territory-wide cohort analysis.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a commonly used biomarker for sepsis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate CRP's diagnostic performance to detect neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), while accounting for both gestational and postnatal age. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of neonates born from January 2006 to December 2017 in public hospitals in Hong Kong. Neonates who had CRP tested within 72 h of birth, prior to antibiotics initiation, were included. CRP values were analyzed by gestational age and time after birth. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS: Among 100 327 tested neonates, 448 developed culture-confirmed EOS, and 34 had meningitis. In uninfected neonates, CRP concentrations rose naturally after 8 h of life, peaking at 24-32 h, with higher values in term neonates at 24-48 h (median 6.2 mg/L, interquartile range 2.9-14.3). Diagnostic performance was better in preterm neonates (e.g., the area under the ROC curve after 4 h of life: 0.88 in <34 weeks, 0.83-0.92 in 34-36 weeks, and 0.73-0.77 in term neonates). Sensitivity within the first 4 h was low across all groups. LRs increased with higher CRP values in preterm neonates. A CRP value of >12.0 mg/L was associated with increased risk of meningitis. INTERPRETATION: CRP is not recommended for EOS screening in term neonates, but it may be considered for assessing the risk of EOS in preterm neonates. Interpretation must account for gestational and postnatal age."
41425961,The non-linear association between creatinine-to-albumin ratio and medium-term mortality in patients with sepsis accompanied by acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database and external validation.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the Creatinine to Albumin Ratio (CAR) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database (v2.2) to analyze data from 2,712 adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and AKI. External validation was performed using a single-center cohort of 412 patients from Ningbo No. 2 Hospital (January 2022-December 2024). Patients were stratified into quartiles based on CAR values. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the consistency of CAR's prognostic utility across various patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Infection types were categorized based on ICD-9/10 codes into pulmonary, abdominal, urinary tract, bloodstream, and other infections. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were excluded to minimize confounding by pre-existing renal impairment. RESULTS: Among 2,712 included patients, those in the highest CAR quartile (Q4) had the lowest survival probability. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in mortality across quartiles (log-rank P<0.001). In fully adjusted Cox models that included newly incorporated metabolic and hemodynamic variables (electrolytes, lactate, and vasopressors use), both continuous CAR (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.16, P = 0.048; ICU mortality: HR = 1.18, P = 0.044) and Q4 (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.72, P<0.001; ICU mortality: HR = 1.61, P<0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality risk. RCS analysis revealed a J-shaped relationship with ICU mortality, with an inflection point at CAR = 1.2 mg/dL. External validation confirmed CAR's prognostic value for 30-day mortality, with consistent associations observed in the validation cohort (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.43, P = 0.032). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed strong early predictive accuracy (7-day AUC = 0.75). Subgroup analyses confirmed CAR's robust prognostic value, which remained consistent across different infection types and was particularly pronounced in older, obese, and mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: CAR is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in sepsis-associated AKI, with both continuous measurements and the highest quartile (Q4) demonstrating significant associations after comprehensive adjustment for metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. The identified threshold (CAR = 1.2 mg/dL) enhances its clinical utility. While CAR provides independent prognostic information, its modest effect sizes suggest it should be used as a complementary tool rather than a standalone predictor. CAR's simplicity and accessibility make it a valuable adjunct for risk stratification in this high-risk population."
41425931,Metabolomic analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae: uncovering key metabolic pathways.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal infection, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a prevalent cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a major pathogen responsible for illnesses such as meningitis, sepsis, and pharyngitis. The complex etiology of S. pneumoniae infection poses significant challenges in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. METHODS: In this study, twenty serum samples from individuals infected with S. pneumoniae and fifteen serum samples from normal controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify metabolites. Multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were used to identify potential metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was employed to map the metabolic pathways associated with these metabolites. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis of the metabolic profiles of infected individuals and normal controls, we identified 418 metabolites that significantly contributed to the differentiation of group samples. The identified metabolites were categorized into various groups, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, and were enriched in pathways including galactose metabolism, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, the citrate cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. S. pneumoniae infection induced significant variations in the serum metabolome, with activation of metabolic pathways implicated in the immune response. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive and real-time analysis of the metabolic network, elucidating the complex processes that occur following pathogen invasion in the human body. The identification of metabolic biomarkers and enriched pathways lays a foundational framework for research and offers visualizable targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumococcal infections."
41425588,Immunophenotyping of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy: focus on monocyte subtypes and Immune regulatory molecules.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is characterized by dysregulation of the host response to infection Q5 which results in life-threatening organ dysfunction that can be partly attributed to immune alterations and endothelial dysfunction (endotheliopathy). This lethal condition is dynamic, complex, and heterogeneous. AIM: Thus, an exploratory broad phenotypic and functional analysis of circulating immune cells and mediators were carried out to better understand the role of the immune system in a subgroup of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy defined by increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). In this regard, especially the immune status of monocyte subtypes (classical, intermediate, and nonclassical) was investigated for surface thrombomodulin (TM), MHC class II molecules (HLADR, -DQ, and -DP) and immunomodulatory surface receptors (TREM-1, CD137, VISTA, HVEM and BTLA). RESULT AND CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis on a septic shock cohort with endotheliopathy identified distinct immune perturbation patterns that potentially can lead to novel treatment avenues in the management of this life-threatening condition."
41424977,Prognostic Models Using the Lactate-to-Albumin Ratio for 28-Day Mortality in ICU Sepsis Patients: A Bayesian Model Averaging Approach.,2025,"PURPOSE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has recently emerged as a significant predictor of 28-day mortality in sepsis. This study aims to determine the prognostic value of LAR for 28-day mortality and identify prognostic models for sepsis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Thong Nhat Hospital, Vietnam. The study included patients aged 16 years and older diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 consensus guidelines. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days from the time of sepsis diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was used to identify candidate models. Discrimination was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), and calibration was assessed. RESULTS: This study included 170 participants with a median age of 73 years and a male predominance (54.1%). The overall 28-day mortality rate was 57.6%. The median LAR was 2.2, with a statistically significant difference between the survival and mortality groups (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that LAR was independently associated with 28-day mortality (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.09-6.86; p = 0.017). The AUC for LAR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.87; p < 0.001) with a cut-off point of 1.2 (sensitivity 91%, specificity 57%). BMA identified three clinically applicable models: LAR combined with age and respiratory infection (AUC 0.855), LAR combined with respiratory infection (AUC 0.839), and LAR combined with age and respiratory infection and SOFA score (AUC 0.864). Internal validation also represented the stability and reproducibility of these models with AUC 0.848, 0.836, and 0.854, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this single-center cohort, higher LAR was independently associated with 28-day mortality, and BMA identified simple LAR-based models with good internal discrimination and calibration. These findings require further external validation before routine clinical implementation."
41424725,Bioinformatics-based identification and validation of mitochondria-related genes associated with neonatal sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: While mitochondrial involvement in sepsis has been widely studied, its role in neonatal sepsis (NESE) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) in NESE using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: This study utilized neonatal sepsis-related datasets GSE69686 and GSE95233. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing NESE and control groups. Subsequently, candidate genes were then selected by intersecting DEGs with MRGs. These candidate genes were further refined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm to identify potential biomarkers. Expression levels and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of the candidate biomarkers were assessed in both datasets. To further investigate their mechanisms, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction analyses were conducted. Finally, biomarker expression was validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 24 candidate genes were obtained by overlapping 579 DEGs and 1,136 MRGs. ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, MTHFD2, PDSS1, and TSPO were identified as biomarkers. The enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and TSPO in the lysosome compartment. Moreover, there were significant differences in seven immune cells (M0 macrophage, activated NK cell, neutrophil, etc) between NESE samples and normal samples. Importantly, the correlation analysis revealed that the expression of ACSL1 exhibited a negative correlation with CD8 + T cells, whereas it demonstrated a positive association with neutrophil. Additionally, it also found birch A and Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin simultaneously targeted TSPO, MTHFD2, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and ACSL1. Importantly, the RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the expression results of PDSS1, TSPO, and ALAS1 were consistent with the public database, showing significantly over-expressed in the NESE group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, six mitochondria-related biomarkers in NESE were identified and preliminarily validated, which may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and serve as a potential basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic exploration."
41424663,Hepatitis due to Enterovirus in a Child.,2025,"Enteroviruses are a common cause of infection in neonates, causing wide spectrum of diseases, including myocarditis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, and sepsis. The enteroviral hepatitis has rarely been recorded in pediatric populations other than neonates. We report a rare case of self-limiting acute hepatitis in a healthy 3-year-old child affected by hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by Enterovirus. Providers should be aware of hepatitis prevalence in the Enteroviral infection, and should consider it in the differential diagnosis for acute hepatitis of unknown origin."
41423760,Group A Streptococcus: A Re-Emerging Pathogen? Two Autopsy Cases of Deadly Infections in Previously Undiagnosed Young Adult Males.,2025,"Streptococcus pyogenes [group A strep (GAS)] is not a novel pathogen, but it is a newly emerging deadly threat. Recent data suggests that GAS, like many other contagions, saw a rise in infections in 2022, likely due to the withdrawal of COVID-19 precautions. GAS can present as a localized infection, namely tonsillopharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and scarlet fever, or as an invasive infection such as meningitis, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and puerperal sepsis. Even though GAS tonsillopharyngitis is not typically fatal, it can be complicated by acute rheumatic fever if antibiotics are not administered promptly. Though the prevalence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its sequelae, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), has declined over the last half-century in Europe and North America, ARF and RHD both remain some of the most significant contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among socially and economically disadvantaged populations globally. Here we present 2 cases of fatal invasive GAS infections in previously healthy young adult males, with diagnoses made postmortem due to a lack of clinical recognition prior to death."
41422470,Meningococcal Disease in Older Adults: Challenges in Diagnosis and Management.,2026,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in older adults frequently presents with atypical clinical manifestations, including bacteremic pneumonia, often without classical meningeal signs or sepsis, which presents clinicians with diagnostic challenges, and may delay treatment, which contributes to the high mortality observed in older adults. Within the broader resurgence of IMD observed since relaxation of quarantine measures introduced to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable increase in reporting of such atypical cases. The aim of this review is to summarize epidemiological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of non-meningeal forms of IMD in older patients, with a focus on meningococcal pneumonia. By convention, laboratory confirmation requires N. meningitidis detection by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or antigen detection. In most cases, presentation of meningococcal pneumonia is similar to that of other forms of community-acquired pneumonia, and cerebrospinal fluid sampling may be non-informative. This places a premium on early blood culture for N. meningitidis, allied with testing of respiratory samples (e.g., broncho-alveolar washes). Many cases are linked to isolates of serogroups Y and W. When confirmed, treatment with third-generation cephalosporins is generally preferred. Chemoprophylaxis and vaccination of close contacts is essential for controlling onward meningococcal disease transmission and prevention of further cases."
41422448,Search for novel biomarkers of febrile neutropenia in hematological patients: an overview.,2025,"A single-center prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kuopio Finland over the past two decades, searching for novel biomarker candidates to predict complicated course of febrile neutropenia (FN) in hematological patients. In Dec 2006‒Dec 2015, 85 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 179 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were included. More than 20 biomarkers were evaluated in subsequent patient cohorts and compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). The samples were taken on d0-d2 from the beginning of FN. Here, we provide an overview of the results of these studies. Most biomarkers evaluated did not provide additional prognostic benefit compared to CRP or PCT. The most promising biomarkers warranting further studies include soluble cluster of differentiation 14, interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18. Several biomarkers evaluated in this series of studies are hampered by impaired production by neutrophils/leukocytes (matrix metalloproteinase-8, cell-free plasma DNA and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) or platelets (vascular endothelial growth factor). For now, these novel biomarkers cannot substitute the conventional markers nor provide additional benefit in routine use. Optimally, the most promising novel markers should be evaluated in prospective multicenter studies with higher patient numbers and several endpoints to more reliably evaluate their performance. At present, close patient monitoring is imperative in hematological patients with FN. The additional information provided by novel FN biomarkers may be useful, but they should be evaluated combined with daily evaluation of sepsis scoring systems."
41422100,Machine learning-based prediction of mortality and multidrug-resistant infection risks in ICU patients with suspected infection: a prospective national multicenter cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Suspected infection can progress to sepsis or septic shock, contributing to a high mortality rate among patients admitted to ICU. However, the characteristics of suspected infection remain incompletely defined. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models to identify independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection in patients with suspected infection upon ICU admission in mainland China. METHODS: We prospectively collected medical data from patients with suspected infection admitted to ICUs across mainland China between July 2021 and December 2022. Patients were randomly allocated to a training cohort and a validation cohort at a 7:3 ratio. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified risk factors and constructed predictive models for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection. The performance of models developed by logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and gradient boosting machine was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), Brier score, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), the Youden index, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: A total of 2963 patients from 67 hospitals in mainland China were enrolled. The most common infection sites were the lung (79.28%), bloodstream (17.11%) and abdomen (16.54%). The overall mortality rate was 10.90%. The logistic regression model demonstrated the best performance for mortality prediction (AUC 0.87) and identified the following risk factors: surgery (2.39, 95CI% 1.60-3.56, p < 0.01), APACHE II score (1.51, 95CI% 1.44-1.58, p < 0.01), and bloodstream infection (2.08, 95CI% 1.40-3.10, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors of mortality. For multidrug resistant infection prediction, the logistic regression model also showed the highest discriminative ability (AUC 0.86). Independent risk factors included APACHE II score (1.06, 95%CI 1.03-1.1, p < 0.01), bloodstream infection (1.82, 95%CI 1.26-2.61, p < 0.01), urinary infection (3.42, 95%CI 2.20-5.30, p < 0.01), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.67, 95%CI 7.91-17.21, p < 0.01), Acinetobacter baumannii (85.22, 95%CI 50.03-145.18, p < 0.01), and Enterococcus faecium (22.10, 95%CI 8.58-56.93, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was the most common infection among ICU patients in mainland China. Using machine learning techniques, we developed and validated predictive models that identified independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection upon ICU admission. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04966390, Registration Date: July 14, 2021). The full record can be accessed at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04966390.

41421980,Leveraging laboratory biomarkers to predict urosepsis after upper urinary tract stone surgery: an explainable machine learning approach.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Urosepsis is a leading cause of perioperative mortality after upper urinary tract stone surgery. This study aimed to develop a simple and accurate predictive model for postoperative sepsis by integrating laboratory parameters using machine learning (ML) and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm. METHODS: Data from 7,464 patients were analyzed, including 155 pre- and postoperative features. Key variables were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and correlation analysis. Eight ML algorithms were employed to develop the predictive model using 10-fold cross-validation. The model's performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. The SHAP algorithm was employed to analyze variable importance. Finally, the model was converted into a publicly accessible application. RESULTS: 116 out of 155 variables (74.84%) differed significantly between the urosepsis (n = 622, 8.33%) and non-urosepsis groups (n = 6,842, 91.67%). LASSO regression identified eight predictive variables: postoperative IL-6, SAA, PCT/ALB, NLPR, PT, ALB, HCT, and neutrophil. Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 1.0, 0.90, and 0.88 for the training, validation, and test cohorts, respectively. A good model fit, strong calibration, and positive clinical utility were confirmed by the learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. Postoperative PCT/ALB, neutrophil, IL-6, ALB, and PT were identified as key predictors by the SHAP algorithm. A publicly accessible web application was developed to facilitate both patients and physicians (https://www.xsmartanalysis.com/model/list/predict/model/html?mid=29648&symbol=71lphm763138mj895nd8). CONCLUSIONS: A robust, interpretable model based on postoperative laboratory biomarkers was successfully developed and validated. This model exhibits excellent predictive performance and clinical utility, and the integration of SHAP analysis provides transparent insights into the key drivers of urosepsis, offering a practical tool for early risk stratification and personalized intervention in clinical practice.

41421230,Mmu_Circ_0001022/hsa_Circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI axis suppressed the progression of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2026,"Sepsis -associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) contributes substantially to mortality and morbidity in critically ill individuals. Although considerable investigation has been conducted, effective therapeutic strategies preventing its advancement remain unavailable, highlighting the importance of understanding its fundamental mechanisms. Previous research identified mmu_circ_26986/hsa_circ_0072463 as a prospective biomarker and treatment target for SA-AKI. The current investigation reveals that mmu_circ_0001022 displays increased expression in BUMPT cells(Boston University Mouse Proximal Tubular Epithelial cell line)and C57BL/6 mouse kidneys following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Experimental analyses indicate that mmu_circ_0001022 diminishes LPS-triggered apoptosis in BUMPT cells. The molecular mechanism involves sequestering miRNA-92a-2-5p, subsequently enhancing SKI expression. Enhanced mmu_circ_0001022 expression reduces CLP-initiated acute kidney injury (AKI) progression through the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Research demonstrates that hsa_ circ_0056869, the mmu_circ_0001022 homologous form, reduces LPS-initiated apoptosis in HK-2 cells (Human Kidney 2 cell line) via the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Notably, septic patients experiencing AKI demonstrated elevated hsa_circ_0056869 plasma concentrations versus non-AKI cases. Analysis revealed hsa_circ_0056869 exhibited 79.41 % sensitivity, 82.35 % specificity, and 0.8175 area under the curve. A marked positive association emerged between hsa_circ_0056869 plasma levels and serum creatinine in septic individuals (r = 0.786). These findings establish the mmu_circ_0001022/hsa_circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway as significant in SA-AKI pathogenesis. In addition, our data indicate that hsa_circ_0056869 may serve as an early diagnosis marker for the septic AKI."
41421176,The diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin for sepsis in critically ill adults. A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Procalcitonin (PCT) has been a blue-eyed-boy in diagnosing sepsis in previous years. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis, according to the recent Sepsis-3 criteria, in adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We searched several electronic databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from the inception of the Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria (January 1, 2016) until May 31, 2025, for randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PCT for sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria among critically ill adult patients with suspected infection. We performed a random effect diagnostic meta-analysis, evaluated the risk of bias of individual studies using the QUADAS tool, and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: We included 10 studies comprising 1098 patients. Of these, 635 patients were diagnosed with sepsis based on Sepsis-3 criteria, including 89 patients with septic shock. The pooled sensitivity of PCT for diagnosing sepsis was 0.72 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 0.68-0.75, low certainty) and the pooled specificity was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.61-0.69, low certainty). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 2.45 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 1.62-3.68), The negative likelihood ratio was 0.38 (95 % CI, 0.28-0.53), and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 7.08 (95 % CI, 3.69-13.58). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of PCT was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.73-0.86). CONCLUSION: Based on pooled analysis, PCT has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of sepsis in ICU patients with suspected infection. These results suggest clinicians should be cautious about using PCT to facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults with suspected infection. Given the ongoing uncertainty, further high-quality data in this population is needed."
41420709,Acute kidney injury in extremely preterm infants: findings from an Australian single-centre retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in infants born extremely preterm (EPT, < 28 weeks' gestation). Neonatal AKI is independently associated with increased mortality and is likely to be associated with kidney dysfunction later in life. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of AKI in EPT infants in a single tertiary neonatal centre. METHODS: Retrospective study of EPT infants admitted to a tertiary neonatal centre in Australia between August 2020 and December 2022. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition (including creatinine and oliguria criteria). Comparisons between AKI and non-AKI cohorts used linear, logistic, or quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 204 infants admitted during the study period, 193 were included in the study (11 excluded due to death or medical transfer within 48 h after birth). Sixty infants (31%) had an episode of AKI during their inpatient admission: 31 (51.7%) had AKI stage 1, 11 (18.3%) had stage 2, and 18 (30%) had stage 3. Among these, 27 (45%) were recognised by the treating team, 18 (30%) had the diagnosis documented on their discharge summary, and three (5%) were referred for nephrology follow-up. Compared with the non-AKI cohort, infants with AKI were of lower gestational age and lower birth weight and had greater exposure to nephrotoxic medication. Infants with AKI had more episodes of sepsis, more days on respiratory support, and more days admitted to a tertiary centre than those without AKI. CONCLUSIONS: AKI in EPT infants is common and associates with multiple comorbidities and treatments in the NICU. These data highlight risk factors on which AKI screening and stewardship programmes can be focused."
41420530,Diagnostic and Prognostic Evaluation of Presepsin Levels in Neonatal Septicemia: A Hospital-Based Study.,2025,"AIMS: Neonatal septicemia is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, and its early diagnosis remains a major challenge. Rapid and reliable biomarkers are essential for timely management. Presepsin, a soluble CD14 subtype, has emerged as a promising early sepsis marker, though evidence in neonates is scarce. This study evaluated its diagnostic and prognostic performance in suspected neonatal sepsis, covering bacterial and fungal infections. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary hospital from May 2023 to November 2024. Eighty-eight neonates with clinically suspected sepsis were enrolled. Blood samples were collected for culture, C-reactive protein (CRP) measured by semiquantitative latex agglutination and Presepsin measured by ELISA. Diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic analysis, and associations with clinical features, birth weight, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Blood cultures were positive in 57 (64.8%) neonates, including 39 bacterial and 18 fungal cases. Presepsin levels were significantly higher in culture-proven sepsis (1208.5 +/- 319.4 pg/mL) than probable sepsis (828.9 +/- 235.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001). ROC analysis identified a cutoff of 906.6 pg/mL, yielding 90% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 84% diagnostic accuracy. Presepsin levels rose faster than CRP, enabling earlier detection. Higher levels were noted in fungal sepsis (1441.4 +/- 357.5 pg/mL) and in neonates with poor outcomes, correlating with longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin is a rapid, reliable biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of neonatal sepsis, including fungal infections. Its use alongside clinical assessment can support timely therapeutic decisions, reduce hospital stay, and improve survival in high-risk neonates."
41420218,"Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological differences between early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis in preterm infants: a cross-sectional study in Vietnam.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Although neonatal sepsis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, few studies in Vietnam have compared the characteristics of early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical, laboratory, and microbiological characteristics of EOS and LOS in preterm neonates at a tertiary obstetric hospital in Vietnam. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 106 preterm infants with culture-confirmed sepsis admitted from August 2022 to May 2024. Clinical data, laboratory results and blood cultures were analyzed. Statistical tests and univariate logistic regression were used to explore differences between EOS and LOS. RESULTS: Of 106 neonates, 24 (22.6%) had EOS, and 82 (77.4%) had LOS. LOS predominated in extremely preterm, very low birth weight infants and was associated with more severe symptoms, including respiratory distress and abnormal heart rate. EOS cases were more likely to have birth weight >/= 1500 g and maternal conditions such as intrapartum fever, genital infections, contaminated amniotic fluid and prolonged amniotic fluid leakage (> 18 h). Laboratory analysis revealed higher levels of leukopenia, platelet and cerebrospinal fluid protein in EOS, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and blood protein in LOS. Gram-negative bacteria were predominant in both groups. Escherichia coli was most common in EOS (46%), whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in LOS (38%). CONCLUSION: EOS and LOS in preterm neonates exhibit distinct patterns in perinatal factors, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and microbiological profiles. Differentiating these two entities may aid in timely diagnosis and guide empirical treatment in settings with limited resources."
41420075,Proteinase 3 is involved in presepsin production through neutrophil extracellular trap phagocytosis by macrophages.,2025,"Presepsin (P-SEP), a soluble subtype of CD14, is widely recognized as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its production remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether M1 macrophages (M1 MPhis) contribute to P-SEP generation by phagocytosing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and degrading NET-derived CD14 through intracellular proteinase 3 (PR3). M1 MPhis were differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors, and NETs were induced in neutrophils stimulated with Escherichia coli or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA. Co-cultures of M1 MPhis and NETs were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blotting. The effects of PR3 inhibition (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or elafin) and phagocytosis inhibition (cytochalasin D or wortmannin) on P-SEP production were also evaluated. Recombinant CD14 (rCD14) was used in an in vitro cleavage assay to confirm PR3-dependent CD14 fragmentation. M1 MPhis actively phagocytosed citrullinated histone H3-positive NETs and produced intracellular P-SEP. P-SEP levels strongly correlated with the percentage of NETs (r = 0.907). Inhibition of PR3 activity or phagocytosis significantly reduced P-SEP production. Furthermore, incubation of rCD14 with PR3 produced P-SEP, and this effect was blocked by PR3 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate that PR3 contributes to P-SEP production through CD14 cleavage following NET phagocytosis by M1 MPhis. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the P-SEP biogenesis and advances the understanding of its role as a biomarker in sepsis.

41419730,"MIDAS: rapid, multiplexed molecular profiling for integrated host-pathogen analysis.",2025,"Addressing the need for integrated molecular analysis in complex infectious conditions requires technologies that rapidly quantify both pathogens and host responses. This is particularly relevant in sepsis research, where existing tools typically measure either microbial or host biomarkers. Here, we present MIDAS (Multiplexed Intelligent Diffraction Analysis System), a proof-of-concept platform that integrates shape-encoded hydrogel particles with lens-free diffraction imaging and deep learning-based analysis to enable simultaneous quantification of bacterial RNA and inflammatory proteins in a single system optimized for potential point-of-care use. The assay completes multiplexed measurements in under 4 h, significantly faster than standard culture workflows ( ~ 20-40 h). Beyond spiked studies, MIDAS is evaluated using specimens from a clinically relevant porcine sepsis model, showing high concordance with culture, qPCR and ELISA. Although further clinical validation is required, this flexible platform may support the development of accessible host-pathogen profiling tools with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, and beyond."
41419476,Distinct gastrointestinal microbial signatures predict parasite levels in controlled Plasmodium infections in both rhesus macaques and humans.,2025,"Functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome include maintenance of immune homeostasis and protection against infectious disease. Current assessments of the role of the GI microbiome in Plasmodium infection have been primarily conducted using mouse models and observational human cohorts. Here, we experimentally assessed associations between pre-infection GI microbiome composition and acute Plasmodium parasitemia using 16S rRNA sequencing and samples from rhesus macaques (RMs) and adult humans enrolled in a previously conducted controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trial (NCT04072302) originally designed to test the efficacy of KAF156, a novel imidazolopiperazine class of antimalarial drugs. We identified distinct pre-infection 16S microbial signatures that were associated with increased risk for above median parasitemia in RMs infected with P. fragile and CHMI participants infected with P. falciparum. Further, we identified a Bifidobacterium feature set that accurately stratified parasitemia risk and could therefore serve as a foundation for a potential biomarker panel to aid prevention efforts in malaria endemic regions. Together, our findings demonstrate that pre-infection GI microbiome composition is indicative of risk for Plasmodium parasitemia, and our observation that the pre-infection microbiome-P. fragile dynamic in RMs mirrors the pre-infection microbiome-P. falciparum interaction in CHMI participants supports the future use of this model in pre-clinical investigations of novel microbiome-targeting approaches to reduce malaria burden."
41419365,"Development and validation of a pre-trained language model for neonatal morbidities: a retrospective, multicentre, prognostic study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification and monitoring of neonatal morbidities are critical for timely interventions that can prevent complications, optimise resource use, and support families. Although traditional tools based on tabular data and biomarkers are beneficial, they are restricted in assessing the risk of morbidities in newborns. In this study, we developed NeonatalBERT, a pre-trained large language model (LLM) that estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from clinical notes. METHODS: This prognostic study investigated retrospective primary and external cohorts from two different quaternary-care academic medical centres in the USA: Stanford Health Care and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. NeonatalBERT was initially pre-trained on clinical notes from the primary cohort and then fine-tuned separately for both cohorts. NeonatalBERT was also compared against other existing LLMs, such as BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT, as well as traditional machine learning and logistic regression models using tabular features. NeonatalBERT was evaluated on 19 neonatal morbidities (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, atelectasis, aspiration syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal seizures, other CNS disorders, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiovascular instability, sepsis, candidiasis, anaemia, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death) for the primary cohort and ten for the external cohort (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death). For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and F1 scores were evaluated. FINDINGS: 32 321 newborns were included in the primary cohort, including 27 411 in the primary training set (mean gestational age 38.64 weeks [SD 2.30]; 13 056 [47.6%] female and 14 355 [52.4%] male newborns) and 4910 in the primary testing set (mean gestational age 38.64 [2.13] weeks; 2336 [47.6%] female and 2574 [52.4%] male newborns). Additionally, 7061 newborns were selected into the external cohort, including 5653 in the external training set (1567 [27.7%] premature and 4086 [72.3%] term births; 2614 [46.2%] female and 3039 [53.8%] male newborns) and 1408 in the external testing set (383 [27.2%] premature and 1025 [72.8%] term births; 624 [44.3%] female and 784 [55.7%] male newborns). In the primary cohort, the mean AUPRC over 19 outcomes was 0.291 (95% CI 0.268-0.314) for NeonatalBERT, 0.238 (0.217-0.259) for Bio-ClinicalBERT, 0.217 (0.197-0.236) for BioBERT, and 0.194 (0.177-0.211) for the traditional model using tabular data. In the external cohort, NeonatalBERT had a mean AUPRC of 0.360 (0.328-0.393), outperforming other models with the range of 0.224-0.333. INTERPRETATION: Based on validation using two large-scale US datasets, NeonatalBERT effectively estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from unstructured clinical notes of newborns. The promising results from this study show the potential of NeonatalBERT to enhance neonatal care and streamline hospital operations.

41418999,"Damage-associated Molecular Patterns, Immunothrombosis, and Intravascular Inflammation in Sepsis: A Narrative Integrative Review.",2025,"Sepsis is now considered a dysregulated host response in which inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial injury converge to create a self-amplifying network of thromboinflammation. This definition reflects maladaptive immunothrombosis-a defense mechanism that becomes pathogenic when excessive, rather than an isolated inflammatory process. This review integrates recent mechanistic advances linking damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), endothelial dysfunction, and intravascular coagulation. Endogenous alarmins, such as high-mobility group box 1, histones, and mitochondrial DNA, engage in pattern recognition (Toll-like receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products) to propagate leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation, and endothelial disruption. The resulting loss of critical endothelial anticoagulant molecules (thrombomodulin, endothelial cell protein C receptor, antithrombin) and glycocalyx degradation convert the vascular endothelium into a procoagulant interface. Complement activation and protease-activated receptor signaling reinforce this loop, producing microvascular thrombosis, capillary leakage, and organ ischemia. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) serve as intravascular scaffolds for fibrin deposition, thereby propagating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Targeted interventions, including recombinant thrombomodulin, antithrombin supplementation, neutralization of NETs and DAMPs, complement blockade, and endothelial-protective strategies, seek to restore vascular homeostasis. A multidomain biomarker approach integrating DAMPs, endothelial markers, and coagulation indices, combined with machine learning-based phenotyping, may enable precision stratification of sepsis endotypes. The convergence of DAMP signaling, immune activation, and coagulation underlies the pathophysiologic continuum from sepsis-induced coagulopathy to DIC. Therapeutically interrupting this axis represents the most promising avenue toward personalized, mechanism-driven treatment in sepsis."
41418639,RETN stratification identifies a highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes in early stage of polytrauma.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Despite early survival, many polytrauma patients ultimately succumb to sepsis driven by trauma-induced immunosuppression. The emergence of HLA-DR(low) monocytes was recognized as a biomarker of immunosuppression, yet they are heterogeneous, and reduced HLA-DR expression does not consistently correlate with global monocyte impairment. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the heterogeneity of HLA-DR(low) monocytes and clarify their specific contributions to immunosuppression. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) were applied to delineate the temporal differentiation trajectories of monocyte subsets post-trauma, leading to the identification of a distinct RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes and characterization of its immunosuppressive functions. Finally, we established a clinical cohort and used published datasets to explore its predictive capacity for sepsis in polytrauma patients. RESULTS: ScRNA-seq and FCA revealed quantitative and functional reprogramming across monocyte subsets and identified a conserved RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) subset enriched in polytrauma patients, characterized by reduced HLA-DR and elevated RETN expression. This subset exhibited profound impairments in core monocyte functions-including antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and cytokine production-compared to other monocyte subsets. Notably, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes can predict sepsis more accurately than HLA-DR(low) monocytes at 72 h (AUC: 0.89 vs. 0.74) post-trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a distinct functional monocyte subset, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes, with markedly impaired hallmark monocyte functions. RETN expression can identify this highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes. In polytrauma patients, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes provided more accurate prediction of sepsis than total HLA-DR(low) monocytes."
41418341,Revisiting the time to positivity in blood cultures as a prediagnostic tool: an in vitro experiment and retrospective study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an acute response to infection; rapid detection of pathogens is essential. In this work, the time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture (BC), a key factor for species diagnosis, was studied. METHODS: In the experimental phase, six bacterial reference strains were tested under varying conditions, and three years of clinical blood culture data were reviewed. A total of 4,924 first positive BC bottles from 3864 patients hospitalized from 2019 to 2021 were analysed. RESULTS: Experimental results revealed that reducing the inoculum by a factor of 10 increased the TTP by an average of 1.5 hours. A blood sample volume between 1 and 3 mL per vial significantly improved bacterial detection. Each hour of delay before incubation reduced the TTP by 21 minutes; however, the overall TTP was still prolonged. Bacterial growth and viability were preserved at room temperature for up to 24 h. TTP could be exploited as a first diagnostic tool, as it significantly varied between species. Staphylococcus aureus can be differentiated from coagulase-negative staphylococci when the TTP is <12 hours (Specificity (Sp) = 0.95, positive predictive value (PPV) = 62 %, negative predictive value (NPV) = 76 %), and Enterobacteriaceae can be differentiated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the same threshold (Sensibility (Se) = 0.70, Sp = 0.93, PPV = 99 %). A TTP >15 hours exclude clinically relevant pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and S. pyogenes. CONCLUSION: This work shows how preanalytical factors play a major role in the time required for diagnosis, and highlights the potential of the TTP as a prediagnostic tool to improve sepsis management."
41417946,Lipid peroxidation-induced neurocardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients with septic shock.,2025,"CONTEXT: Septic shock's fatal signs include hemodynamic collapse, systemic inflammation, and organ failure. Neurocardiac dysfunctions worsen outcomes, with lipid peroxidation from oxidative stress as a key damage mechanism. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study is to investigates how lipid peroxidation in cell membranes generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial damage, cell death, and autonomic dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), toxic byproducts, contribute to cardiomyocyte injury, endothelial damage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and altered neuronal signalling. The research analyzes preclinical and clinical data associating sepsis oxidative indicators with poorer cardiac and neurological outcomes. Results: chronological relationship between oxidative stress, cardiac damage, and neural injury. While the visualisation highlights elevated biomarker levels in critically ill neurocardiac patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, risk classification, and focused treatment for septic shock may benefit from understanding neurocardiac dysfunction and lipid peroxidation."
41417340,"Neonatal outcomes associated with maternal arbovirus infection (dengue, Zika, and chikungunya) among pregnant women with obstetric complications in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Arboviruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), pose serious threats to neonatal health; however, the consequences of maternal peripartum infections, particularly those that are asymptomatic, remain poorly characterized. METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study investigated the adverse neonatal outcomes associated with maternal arbovirus infection among pregnant women hospitalized for obstetric complications in Northeast Brazil (October 2018 to May 2019). Maternal and neonatal data were collected through interviews and reviewing medical records. Acute/recent maternal infections were confirmed by molecular or serological assays. Associations between maternal infection (categorized as any arbovirus, ZIKV-only, or CHIKV-only) and neonatal outcomes were assessed using Poisson's regression with robust variance, yielding adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlled for maternal covariates. RESULTS: Among 806 neonates, 131 (16.3%) were born to arbovirus-infected mothers and had a higher prevalence of prematurity (aPR=1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) and sepsis (aPR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.07-2.83) compared with those born to non-infected mothers. Neonates of ZIKV-infected mothers had a two-fold higher prevalence of sepsis (aPR=2.02, 95% CI: 1.00-4.11) than neonates of non-infected mothers, and a trend was observed for CHIKV (aPR=1.76, 95% CI: 0.97-3.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this hyperendemic region, a high frequency of newborns were exposed to maternal arbovirus infection during the inter-epidemic period, which was associated with increased premature births and neonatal sepsis. These findings underscore the need for increased clinical vigilance and routine screening in endemic areas, necessitating further longitudinal studies to confirm causality and guide management."
41416657,Megacystis-Megacolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome with Intestinal Neuronal Dysplasia: Expanding the Phenotypic Spectrum.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Megacystitis-megacolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome is a phenotypic variant of visceral neuromuscular dysfunction. Megacystitis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome is a recognized entity. However, presentation with megacolon is rarely reported, with only one case documented in association with intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) and malrotation. CASE REPORT: We report such a case of Megacystitis-megacolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis coexisting with IND type B and atypical malrotation in a 2-year-old male, presented with intestinal obstruction. Despite multiple surgical interventions, the patient remained TPN-dependent and eventually succumbed to sepsis. Histopathology evaluation revealed hyperganglionosis, including the presence of immature and giant ganglion cells, which supported the diagnosis of IND type B, alongside the features of visceral myopathy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity posed by overlapping features of megacolon and MMIHS, especially when hyperganglionosis was present. Our case highlights the need for clinico-pathological correlation and genetic analysis in diagnosing complex pediatric motility disorders."
41416546,[Causes and mechanisms of death in abdominal surgery].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the causes and mechanisms of postoperative mortality in abdominal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The primary endpoints were mechanism and cause of death within 30 days after surgery. Mortality-associated factors were examined in Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects. RESULTS: Analysis included 550 patients (335 (60.9%) men and 215 (39.1%) women) who underwent abdominal surgery in level II hospitals; 59 (10.7%) out of 550 patients died within 30 days after surgery. Mean age of patients was 53 years. In respiratory diseases, acute respiratory failure associated with damage to lung parenchyma should be noted. Among cardiovascular diseases, the following mechanisms should be distinguished: distributive (e.g., intestinal ischemia, anastomotic insufficiency, sepsis), hypovolemic (blood loss), obstructive (PE), cardiogenic (acute heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction). The most common causes of death were gastrointestinal perforations (7 patients), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (2 patients), PE (3 patients), and intestinal gangrene (2 patients). Among 59 patients, 6 (10.2%) died within 24 hours, 21 (35.6%) - within the period from 24 hours to 7 days, 12 (20.3%) - within 8-14 days, 20 (33.9%) - later than 14 days after surgery. Forty-seven (79.7%) out of 59 patients died in hospital and 12 (20.3%) patients died outside the hospital. CONCLUSION: Circulatory failure accounts for majority of deaths after abdominal surgery. Differences in time to death highlight the risk of death throughout perioperative period and after discharge. We propose to stratify the causes of death to primary and secondary ones (due to the main disease independent on postoperative outcomes and due to postoperative complication)."
41416145,"[Molecular Epidemiology and Fluconazole Resistance Mechanisms in Candida tropicalis Isolates From Bloodstream Infections in Sichuan, China].",2025,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) isolates from bloodstream infections, and to investigate preliminarily the underlying mechanisms of fluconazole resistance. METHODS: Clinical C. tropicalis isolates were collected from bloodstream infections at West China Hospital, Sichuan University and other hospitals in Sichuan Province. All the collected isolates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the antifungal susceptibility test was performed by the broth microdilution method. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was conducted using the first generation sequencing technique. Genes associated with drug-resistance were sequenced and the mutation sites were identified. The relative expression levels of genes associated with drug-resistance were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 39 C. tropicalis isolates from bloodstream infections were collected. The MLST phylogenetic tree showed that most of the strains clustered in the phylogenetic tree shared identical or similar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). All MLST types were not matched with the isolates in the PubMLST database, representing new diploid sequence types (DSTs). A total of 3 sense mutations, including Ser154Phe, Tyr132Phe, and Tyr257His were identified in ERG11, and were present only in drug-resistant strains. UPC2 contained 4 sense mutations, including Ala251Thr, Gln289Leu, Ser279Glu, and Gln313His, which were also present only in drug-resistant strains. Ser279Glu and Gln313His were previously unreported. There were two sense mutations in ERG3, namely Ser112Gly and Ala48Ser, both being previously unreported, and Ser112Gly was found only in drug-resistant strains. The expression levels of ERG11 (14.48 vs 7.109, P = 0.003) and UPC2 (1.922 vs 0.832, P = 0.04) in non-sensitive group (MIC > 2 mg/L) were higher than those in sensitive group (MIC </= 2 mg/L), and the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There may be a unique genetic relationship among C. tropicalis isolates from Sichuan province, and the MICs of fluconazole against C. tropicalis are associated with molecular typing. ERG11 mutations were the major mechanism underlying fluconazole resistance in C. tropicalis isolates. The upregulation of ERG11 and UPC2 was associated with fluconazole resistance in C. tropicalis."
41416069,The diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III activity for sepsis-induced coagulopathy in septic patients: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), therefore, studying the diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III (AT-III) activity in SIC may be useful for early identification and intervention of SIC. METHODS: This study is a single-center cohort study, prospectively enrolling patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU from March 2023 to March 2024. Based on whether the SIC score was greater than or equal to 4, the enrolled sepsis patients were divided into the SIC group and the non-SIC group. The SIC scoring system consists of three parameters: International normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The measurement of AT-III activity was completed within 12 h of the patient being admitted to the ICU. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of different biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of SIC. The DeLong Test was employed to compare whether there was a significant difference between AUCs. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted and Log-rank test was performed to compare the 28-day survival rates among different groups. RESULTS: This study included a total of 366 patients with sepsis, among which 235 (64.2%) were in the SIC group and 131 (35.8%) were in the non-SIC group. The AT-III activity in the SIC group was significantly lower than that in the non-SIC group (P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC for AT-III activity was 0.799 (P < 0.001), the AUC for platelets was 0.806 (P < 0.001), the AUC for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 0.746 (P < 0.001), and the AUC for international normalized ratio (INR) was 0.765 (P < 0.001). The results of the DeLong Test showed that the AUC for AT-III activity in diagnosing SIC had no statistically significant difference compared with the AUCs of the traditional diagnostic indicators, including platelets, SOFA score, and INR (P > 0.05). The cut-off value of AT-III activity for diagnosing SIC is 59.7%, with a sensitivity of 79.91%, specificity of 69.77%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 82.59%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 65.94%. There was no statistical difference in AT-III activity between the survival and non-survival groups of SIC patients (P > 0.05). The proportion of shock and the duration of vasopressor use were both lower in the high AT-III group (>/= 59.7%) than in the low AT-III group < 59.7%) (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the 28-day survival probability between the high AT-III group and the low AT-III group (P = 0.350). CONCLUSION: AT-III activity is a potentially helpful adjunctive biomarker for diagnosing SIC that performs similarly to the biomarkers and scores currently used to diagnose SIC."
41415798,Role of Metabolic Syndrome Traits on Infectious Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the causal association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components [systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose (FG), waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG)] with seven infectious diseases (COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19, very severe COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, influenza, intestinal infection, and sepsis) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Causal estimates were primarily obtained using the inverse-variance weighted method, with multiple sensitivity analyses conducted to assess heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. RESULTS: MetS was causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.09), hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.27), very severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.40), and sepsis (OR = 1.50). Among MetS components, WC increased risks of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.10), hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.39), very severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.56), bacterial pneumonia (OR = 1.11), and sepsis (OR = 1.42), while HDL-C reduced risks of intestinal infection (OR = 0.96) and sepsis (OR = 0.92). CONCLUSION: This MR study supports a causal link between MetS traits and several infectious diseases, emphasizing the importance of metabolic management in reducing infection susceptibility."
41415274,Multiplexed longitudinal analysis of the cellular and microbial dynamics of acute polymicrobial sepsis in mice.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Acute polymicrobial sepsis is a life-threatening emergency caused by the body's immune response to bloodstream infection by two or more microbes. Early detection and management of sepsis have been the focus of global survey programs, driven by its association with hospital readmissions and long-term adverse health outcomes. METHODS: Animal models are essential tools for studying mechanisms of sepsis pathogenesis and the only way to empirically dissect the acute phase of disease. With this in mind, the goal of the current study was two-fold: to demonstrate the feasibility of performing multiplexed longitudinal assessment of acute sepsis pathogenesis and to emphasize the granularity with which acute sepsis can be studied using this method. Using the fecal suspension test (FST) model of acute polymicrobial sepsis in C57BL/6 mice we simultaneously characterize hematological, immunological, and microbiological aspects of acute sepsis induction. RESULTS: Our data shows that high dimensional flow cytometry paired with flow-based plasma cytokine measurements captures the dynamic shift from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory immune responses during an acute septic event; highlighting the role of emergency myelopoiesis in this process. Additionally, myeloid cell heterogeneity is characterized and strongly implicates the emergence of myeloid derived suppressor like cells (MDSC-like cells) as central to this switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 16S-based method for studying the blood biome that allows for discrimination between endogenous (bacterial DNAemia) and exogenous (actively growing bacteria in blood) sources of microbial DNA. Using this approach, we demonstrate that polymicrobial sepsis in our model is due to outgrowth of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus; two genera of bacterial pathobionts commonly observed in human sepsis patients. Finally, using several assessments of disease severity, we demonstrate stratification of septic mice into survivors and non-survivors and show how pre-septic immune assessment can be used to identify potential biomarkers of sepsis risk. DISCUSSION: Collectively, the approach we describe simultaneously reduces research animal use, strengthens scientific rigor, provides a pre-clinical platform for biomarker discovery and the study of therapeutic interventions, and most importantly advances our ability to study the acute phase of sepsis that carries a high mortality rate and is difficult to prospectively study in humans."
41413709,Prospective observational study of cell-free DNA as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis: COVSEP-study.,2025,"Hyperinflammation and extensive cell damage characterize both COVID-19-sepsis and bacterial sepsis, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), reflects ongoing tissue injury and may predict mortality. We aimed to evaluate cfDNA as a prognostic biomarker for 30-day mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19- vs. bacterial sepsis, and its association with inflammatory markers and disease progression. In a prospective observational study (ethics approval: 2020-15,535; DRKS-ID: DRKS00025222), cfDNA was quantified in 64 ICU patients (COVID-19-sepsis n = 27, bacterial sepsis n = 37) at four time points using quantitative PCR targeting 90 bp and 222 bp fragments of LINE-1 elements. An Integrity Index (222/90 bp) was calculated to infer the predominant mode of cell death. Nineteen healthy individuals served as controls. Associations with mortality and clinical parameters were analyzed using adjusted Cox regression, time-dependent models, and correlation analyses. Higher cfDNA levels (90 bp) within the first 24 h were strongly associated with 30-day (p = 0.003) and 180-day mortality (p = 0.003) in COVID-19-sepsis, but not in bacterial sepsis. COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher cfDNA levels (p < 0.01), which correlated with CRP, PCT, LDH, and lactate. The Integrity Index increased over time in bacterial sepsis and remained stable in COVID-19-sepsis, but was not predictive of survival. Elevated cfDNA levels were associated with ECMO therapy but not with renal replacement therapy. cfDNA is a valuable early prognostic biomarker in COVID-19-sepsis. Its rapid dynamics and strong correlation with clinical outcomes highlight its potential for real-time monitoring and risk stratification in viral sepsis."
41413552,Asymptomatic parasitaemia in a malaria pre-elimination setting in the Putumayo area of the Ecuadorian Amazon basin.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Ecuador is approaching malaria elimination, but its Amazonian Putumayo canton borders regions in Colombia and Peru with high transmission intensity. This 'frontier' setting represents a critical vulnerability where asymptomatic infections may sustain transmission, undetected by routine surveillance. METHODS: In a repeated cross-sectional study during the 2023 rainy season, we surveyed 293 asymptomatic individuals in four riverine communities in Putumayo. We used a tiered diagnostic approach: rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), expert microscopy, and real-time qPCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene. RESULTS: No infections were detected by RDT (0/293). Microscopy identified three P. vivax infections (1.0%, 95% CI 0.2-2.4%). qPCR detected five positive cases (1.7%, 95% CI 0.6-3.9%), revealing two additional submicroscopic infections. The failure of a subsequent species-specific PCR and high Cq values (mean 32.6) indicated very low parasite densities. Infections were found only in the mid-to-late rainy season, predominantly in males. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular surveillance revealed a low-density, asymptomatic malaria reservoir missed entirely by RDTs, and partially by microscopy. This hidden burden represents a critical blind spot for Ecuador's elimination program. To achieve and sustain elimination, surveillance in such border regions must incorporate highly sensitive molecular tools and be supported by robust cross-border collaboration."
41413461,Therapeutic plasma exchange in severe postpartum HELLP syndrome: a promising treatment.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening obstetric complication marked by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia and potentially affecting multiple organ systems. While definitive treatment is typically achieved through delivery, in rare instances, both clinical and laboratory parameters may worsen in the postpartum period. In such critical cases, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) can serve as a potentially life-saving intervention. METHODS: This study analyzed the laboratory and clinical responses of 21 patients diagnosed with severe HELLP syndrome who underwent postpartum TPE between 2010 and 2023. RESULTS: Of the 21 patients, 14 (66.7%) were categorized as class 1 HELLP syndrome, and 7 (33.3%) as class 2. TPE was administered in a single session for 8 patients (38.1%), in two sessions for another 8 (38.1%), and in three sessions for the remaining 5 (23.8%). A significant increase in platelet count and significant decreases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels were observed when compared before and after TPE. Despite intervention, severe complications-including sepsis, pulmonary edema, renal failure, cerebrovascular events, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-developed in 9 patients (42.8%). One patient (4.8%) died due to multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TPE administered in the postpartum period can significantly improve clinical outcomes, hematological and biochemical derangements in patients with severe HELLP syndrome. Early initiation of TPE, ideally within 24-48 h following delivery in patients unresponsive to supportive care, is strongly recommended.

41413004,P23 Scurvy presenting as an unusual petechial rash in a patient with anorexia nervosa.,2025,"An 18-year-old girl with extreme anorexia nervosa (BMI 13 kg/m2, 37.9 kilograms) was admitted for nutritional stabilisation. She reported a two-week history of abdominal pain, reduced urine output and a widespread rash on her abdomen, arms and legs. She appeared cachectic, drowsy, dehydrated and unwell. She was empirically started on intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected intra-abdominal sepsis. She had cutaneous signs of anorexia nervosa including pale skin with lanugo hair and xerosis, angular stomatitis, dry, listless, thin hair and calluses over the knuckles from self-induced vomiting (Russell sign). A non-blanching petechial and purpuric rash covered the peri-umbilical area, forearms and shins. Corkscrew hairs and perifollicular haemorrhages were visible on her shins. Laboratory tests including clotting were normal apart from mild renal impairment and severe hypophosphataemia. Ultrasound scan of the urinary tract, non-contrast full body CT scan, throat swab, peripheral blood and urine cultures were unremarkable. A 5 mm punch biopsy from the rash on the abdomen showed extensive fresh, pan-dermal interstitial haemorrhage in keeping with purpura, with no evidence of vasculopathy or active inflammation. This led to a diagnosis of scurvy secondary to anorexia nervosa. She received nasogastric feeding and IV phosphate replacement for refeeding syndrome. Treatment with IV Pabrinex, which contains 500 milligrams of Vitamin C in each No. 2 ampoule, achieved a dramatic resolution of the rash within a week. Our case of atypical scurvy presenting without the classical gingival signs highlights the importance of clinical examination and dietary history in malnourished, unwell patients presenting with a petechial rash."
41412939,Novel association between true surgical pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforations in a newborn and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,2025,"A late preterm male baby with antenatally diagnosed left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) was delivered electively at 36 weeks of gestation. He remained stable until day 2 of life, when he developed severe persistent pulmonary hypertension secondary to sepsis, including persistent Candida sepsis, delaying CDH repair. On day 13, he developed sudden abdominal distension, and radiography confirmed pneumoperitoneum without pneumothorax. Primary peritoneal drainage released a gush of air, following which exploratory surgery was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed two separate small bowel perforations that were resected and anastomosed along with CDH repair. This case highlights one of the first reported instances of true surgical pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforations in a neonate with CDH, unlike previously described cases where pneumoperitoneum was attributed to pulmonary air leaks or gastric perforation."
41412563,Interferon regulatory factor 1 promotes pyroptosis and inflammation in mouse sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.,2026,"Although pyroptosis is involved in sepsis and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanims of myocardial pyroptosis in the progression of SIC. We first identified differentially expressed genes and hub pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in SIC using bioinformatics analyses and then constructed in vitro and in vivo SIC models to reveal the specific mechanisms of hub PRGs in SIC development. In this study, we confirmed eight hub PRGs (caspase-1, IRF1, IL-6, GSDMD, caspase-6, IL-1beta, caspase-8, and ZBP1) as potential candidate biomarkers for SIC and their expression change in cardiac tissue and myocardial cells in sepsis was fully validated through a serials of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, KEGG analysis displayed that these hub PRGs were enriched for NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways and IRF1 is an upstream regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. SIC mice treated with IRF1 inhibitor, N-acetyl- l-cysteine (NAC), showed notable amelioration of cardiac histological injury, reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, and decreased expression of NLRP3, pyroptosis-related markers, and pro-inflammatory factors. The IRF1-knockdown H9C2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pyroptosis-related markers. Overall, these findings suggest that IRF1 deficiency attenuates sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting pyroptosis and inflammation. Therefore, targeting IRF1 in cardiomyocytes may be a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing SIC."
41412547,Low-level viremia increases the risk of adverse long-term outcomes in entecavir-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.,2026,"Low-level viremia (LLV) still occurs in some patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) after entecavir (ETV) treatment. We aimed to evaluate the effects of LLV on the adverse long-term outcomes. A secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective cohort study, consisting patients who underwent liver biopsy and received entecavir treatment, was conducted. LLV was defined as detectable HBV DNA levels (20-2000 IU/mL) at week 48 after the imitation of ETV treatment, maintained complete virological response (CVR) was defined as HBV DNA <20 IU/mL. The zero time was defined as the date of LLV diagnosis, the primary endpoint was the occurrence of HCC. The time-to-event analyses were performed using log-rank analysis, and multivariable COX regression. The inverse probability of treatment weighting and propensity score matching were used in the sensitivity analyses. In total, 766 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, and LLV was found in 182 patients (23.8 %). Patients with LLV had a significantly higher 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC (18.7 % vs. 8.1 %, p < 0.001) and fibrosis progression rate (17.5 % vs. 8.7 %, p = 0.017) than those with CVR. Multivariate analysis identified LLV as an independent risk factor associated with HCC (adjusted HR: 3.935; 95 % CI: 2.218-6.979, p < 0.001) and fibrosis progression (adjusted OR 5.342; 95 % CI: 1.630-17.480, p = 0.006). A nomogram incorporating LLV, age, PLT and liver cirrhosis was developed and validated for HCC risk prediction, demonstrating excellent performance with a C-index of 0.778. In conclusion, LLV significantly promoted HCC occurrence and fibrosis progression in CHB patients receiving anti-HBV treatment."
41412306,"Characteristics of invasive group B streptococcal infections in adults and older individuals in a super-aging society in Japan, 2016-2023.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract, can cause invasive GBS (iGBS) infections, particularly in older adults with underlying comorbidities. We determined the relationship between mortality and host-related or virulence factors in older adults with iGBS infections. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 105 cases of iGBS infection treated between January 2016 and October 2023 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and two affiliated hospitals. The association between patient outcomes and demographics, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, medical treatment, biomarkers, antimicrobial agents used at admission, and capsular type of GBS isolates was examined. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 78 years (interquartile range, 64-85 years), and 89.5 % had underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and malignancies. Common clinical manifestations include skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and urosepsis. The overall mortality rate was 11.4 %. White blood cell (WBC) counts (breakpoint,10 x 10(3)/muL) on admission were significantly lower in fatal cases (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 9.6), but no significant differences were observed for other biomarkers. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 28-day survival was associated with WBC count (P < 0.001). The most common capsular type was Ib, followed by type V. Levofloxacin resistance was predominantly identified in type Ib. No significant association was found between capsular type and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Effective prevention of iGBS infections in older individuals requires large-scale surveillance, including environmental factors, and the development of comprehensive and multifaceted prevention strategies for high-risk older populations."
41412305,The first pediatric case successfully treated with cefiderocol for IMP-type carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales bacteremia.,2026,"Cefiderocol, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, exhibits potent activity against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). While its clinical efficacy has been reported for infections caused by KPC-type CPE and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, evidence regarding its effectiveness against IMP-type CPE remains primarily derived from in vitro studies, with limited clinical data available. This is the first pediatric case successfully treated with cefiderocol for IMP-type CPE bacteremia. He was a 6-year-old boy with inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency and acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. He developed bacteremia that blood culture multiplex PCR identified Klebsiella pneumoniae with IMP gene. The combination therapy of cefiderocol 60mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and gentamicin 5mg/kg/dose once daily sterilized blood culture, and subsequent monotherapy with cefiderocol was continued for a total of 14 days. Additional molecular test in the strain detected IMP-1 carbapenemase, SHV extended spectrum beta-lactamase and EBC-type AmpC beta-lactamase. Cefiderocol was susceptible at minimum inhibitory concentration 0.5mug/mL. Further study is needed for cefiderocol treatment for IMP-type CPE infection in children."
41411766,The risks and benefits of disseminated intravascular coagulation-targeted anticoagulant therapy in abdominal sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal sepsis frequently leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), exacerbating organ dysfunction and bleeding complications. Although anticoagulant therapy is a potential treatment for DIC, its use in this context raises concerns about bleeding risks. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate the risks and benefits of DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy in patients with abdominal sepsis. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a dataset from a multicenter nationwide retrospective cohort study (J-Septic DIC registry) in Japan between 2011 and 2013. The study included 987 patients with abdominal sepsis-induced DIC, diagnosed within three days of ICU admission. Patients were divided into DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy (recombinant thrombomodulin or antithrombin) and non-use groups. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounding factors. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day mortality, with bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion as the primary safety outcome. RESULTS: The results indicated that anticoagulant therapy was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio: 0.662, 95 % confidential interval: 0.472-0.929), but a higher risk of bleeding complications (OR: 2.451, 95 % confidential interval:1.372-4.379). Dual combination of anticoagulant therapy did not provide additional survival benefits and increased bleeding risks. The efficacy of DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy correlated with disease severity, while bleeding risk was inversely correlated with severity. CONCLUSION: DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy in patients with abdominal sepsis was related with improved prognosis but increased bleeding risks. The risk-benefit profile varies with disease severity, suggesting a need for cautious and personalized treatment strategies."
41410575,Validation and Application of a Predictive Score of Acute Chest Syndrome.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease, and acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication with a substantial risk of death. The aim of this study was to validate the previously developed PREdictive SEVerity (PRESEV) score for the occurrence of ACS in adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized for VOC and to assess the safety of outpatient management of patients with a low-risk score. METHODS: To validate the PRESEV score, a prospective observational study was conducted in 13 centers across 5 countries in Africa and Europe. The score ranges from 0 to 16, with values of 5 or less considered low risk. The safety of a low-risk score (</=5) for outpatient management was then assessed in 100 patients. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ACS. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients were included for the validation of the score: 206 (52.4%) from Europe and 187 (47.6%) from Africa. Of these, 76 patients (19.3%) developed ACS. Of the 50 patients (12.7%) with a low-risk score, 3 (6.0%) developed ACS (negative predictive value 94.0%). Of the 76 patients who developed ACS, 73 (96.1%) did not have a low-risk score (sensitivity 96.1%). A total of five deaths (1.3%) was recorded; no individuals who died had a low-risk score. Score performance was similar across both continents. When the score was used to guide outpatient management in 100 patients with VOC, one case of ACS (1.0%) was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This international study validated the PRESEV predictive risk score to identify adult patients at low risk for ACS.

41409983,Low-cost in-house re-formulated brain heart infusion medium for effective planktonic growth and early detection of bloodstream bacterial pathogens.,2025,"Sepsis, a clinically defined life-threatening condition, is a global contributor to high morbidity and mortality rates in humans. It is caused by systemic bloodstream bacterial infections, primarily involving aerobic pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rapid and accurate identification of these pathogens is a high-demand task, as prolonged diagnosis may increase the mortality rate among sepsis patients. Globally, commercial blood culture systems like the BD BACTEC FX blood culture system, which utilizes BD BACTEC PLUS Aerobic/F culture bottles (used in this study), are commonly used to detect aerobic bloodstream infections. However, due to high costs ( approximately $10.00-$15.00/bottle), limited availability of culture media (especially in low- and middle-income countries, and war zones), and a lack of customization for antibiotic susceptibility assay and epidemiology research, there is a need for secondary alternatives to facilitate the growth and identification of bloodborne pathogens. Therefore, we developed a low-cost ( approximately $4-$5/bottle) in-house culture medium with a newly improved formulation of Brain Heart Infusion media that enhances bacterial growth from spiked human blood tested on a panel of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis). The growth dynamics of these microbes in in-house formulated BHI-Blood+ culture media coincide with those in BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F culture vials, which primarily suggests the compatibility of bloodborne pathogens with this media and can be flagged positive <8 h based on cellular growth rate. Additionally, conventional qPCR-based early detection (<24 h) and validation with the Oxford Nanopore MinION NGS platform highlight the value of this in-house culture media as an alternative to commercial culture media in terms of low-cost availability."
41409941,Study of a Semi-quantitative Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Procalcitonin Detection in Postpartum Sepsis Diagnosis.,2025,"Introduction Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge, causing millions of deaths annually and highlighting the urgent need for rapid diagnostic tools. This study evaluated the performance of a semi-quantitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for procalcitonin (PCT) detection in postpartum sepsis diagnosis, addressing the critical need for point-of-care testing (POCT) in resource-limited settings. Methods A prospective, single-center validation study was conducted with 59 postpartum women enrolled from routine postpartum checkups. The study population included 25 healthy controls, 20 postpartum women without sepsis, and 14 with confirmed sepsis. All participants underwent PCT testing using both the semi-quantitative LFIA and reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Analytical performance parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and clinical correlation, were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal cut-off values. Results The PCT LFIA demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 96.2% (95% CI: 88.2%-99.4%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CI: 87.5%-99.8%) at a cut-off of 0.5 ng/mL. The assay showed strong correlation with reference ELISA methods (r > 0.97) and maintained precision with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 3.2% to 6.5% and inter-assay variation from 4.6% to 8.9%. The limit of detection (LoD) was 0.5 ng/mL with a limit of quantification (LoQ) of 1.0 ng/mL. Postpartum women with sepsis showed significantly elevated PCT levels compared to healthy controls and those without sepsis. Conclusion The semi-quantitative PCT LFIA offers a promising, cost-effective tool for rapid sepsis diagnosis in postpartum women. The assay's high sensitivity and specificity, combined with its point-of-care applicability, make it particularly valuable for improving maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings where timely sepsis diagnosis is crucial."
41408558,Predicting mortality in critically ill patients: a machine learning approach to electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors.,2025,"The study aimed to enhance ICU mortality prediction by integrating electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors using machine learning, addressing gaps in traditional severity scores like SOFA and APACHE II. Dominant Predictors of Mortality: SOFA score >/= 8 (aOR = 4.0), mechanical ventilation (aOR = 3.1), hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L; aOR = 2.6), vasopressor use (aOR = 2.7), and GCS </= 8 (aOR = 2.4). High-Risk Phenotypes: ""Triad of Death"" (SOFA >/= 8 + mechanical ventilation + vasopressors), metabolic crisis (lactate > 4 mmol/L + pH < 7.2), and frail elderly (age >/= 65 with comorbidities). The XGBoost model achieved superior discrimination (AUC-ROC = 0.86) compared to logistic regression (AUC = 0.84), SOFA (AUC = 0.72), and APACHE II (AUC = 0.75). A nomogram was developed to stratify mortality risk into four actionable tiers (e.g., scores > 150 predicted > 60% mortality). The model performed consistently across subgroups (sepsis, age strata, AKI stages), with AUCs > 0.80. Sepsis patients: Lactate and vasopressor use were stronger predictors (38% contribution to SHAP values) Early correction of modifiable factors (e.g., sepsis, acidosis) may improve outcomes. The nomogram offers a practical bedside tool for risk stratification and clinical decision-making."
41408369,Age-related epidemiology and outcomes of sepsis in Japanese critical care units: a nationwide administrative claims database study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The global rise in the elderly population presents unique challenges in intensive care, including treatment decisions and end-of-life care due to physiological, ethical, and social complexities. However, data on the very elderly remain limited, highlighting the need for real-world, large-scale studies. We aimed to characterize the age-related epidemiology and outcomes of sepsis in Japan using a nationwide administrative claims database. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for fiscal years 2010-2019. Sepsis was defined by infection-related ICD-10 codes, blood culture testing, and administration of antimicrobials within a three-day window around admission to critical care unit. Patients were stratified into 10-year age groups, and logistic regression was used to assess the association between age and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 1,880,275 critical care patients with infection-related diagnosis, 511,848 met the sepsis criteria. The median age was 76 years, and 40.0% were aged >/= 80 years. ICU and hospital mortality increased with age, reaching 9.5% and 24.9%, respectively, in patients aged >/= 90 years. Compared to patients aged </= 29 years, those aged >/= 90 had an adjusted odds ratio of 4.75 (95% CI 4.37-5.16) for in-hospital mortality. The proportion of patients discharged home declined with age, falling to 29.4% in the >/= 90 group. Use of organ support, including vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, was inversely related to age. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis in Japanese critical care units demonstrated substantial age-related differences in epidemiology, treatment, resource utilization, and outcomes. The disproportionately high mortality and reduced treatment intensity among the oldest patients underscore the complex clinical and ethical considerations involved in managing sepsis in aging societies. These findings emphasize the urgent need to adapt sepsis care models and critical care resource planning for the rapidly aging population in Japan and similar nations."
41408335,Pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury: a case report and review of the literature.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease that is rarely diagnosed in Europe. Its clinical presentation is highly variable, requiring consideration of a broad differential diagnosis. METHODS: We present a case report of a pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury, and a systematic review of the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 73-year-old white man who presented with pneumonia, sepsis and acute kidney injury due to a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with negativity for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Initial management with dialysis, empirical antibiotics, and immunosuppression was adjusted after identification of Francisella tularensis, and targeted antibiotic therapy was administered successfully. At 4 years of follow-up, no recurrence was observed. LITERATURE REVIEW: Our review of the literature identified only a few case reports of tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury. None documented biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury is an uncommon clinical constellation. Biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negativity in this setting appears to be very rare. Careful differential diagnosis, early recognition of tularemia, and timely initiation of effective antibiotic therapy are critical to achieving favorable outcomes."
41408189,"Catheter‑related bloodstream infections and risk factors in infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units at Mogadishu, Somalia: two years of experience.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections in neonates and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the incidence of CRBSIs and to examine the risk factors, clinical characteristics, and microbial profiles of CRBSIs, with emphasis on catheter type and birth weight classification. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Mogadishu-Somalia-Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan Training and Research Hospital. Medical records of neonates admitted between January 2022 and December 2024 were reviewed. Of 1,781 neonates admitted, 300 met the inclusion criteria according to the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for CRBSI diagnosis, which include paired blood cultures, catheter tip cultures, or differential time to positivity. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23, including Spearman's correlation and multivariable logistic regression to identify independent risk factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,781 neonates were admitted to the NICU, of whom 300 developed CRBSIs, corresponding to an incidence of 16.8%. Of these, 60% were male and 40% female. The majority (53%) were born between 36 and 42 weeks of gestation, while 29.3% had birth weights > 2,500 g. Significant associations were observed between prognosis and parameters including birth weight, gestational age, catheter type, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and culture sample type (p < 0.005). Analysis of culture results showed that Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by E. coli and Candida spp. A significant correlation was identified between cathetertype and isolate type (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the highest frequency of Gram-negative isolates was observed among preterm gestational age groups (p = 0.002). Regarding antimicrobial resistance, Gram-negative isolates exhibited high resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Gram-positive isolates, including MRSA and MRCNS, showed substantial resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Among neonates in Mogadishu, low birth weight, preterm gestational age, catheter type, and elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with CRBSI prognosis. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance among both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens underscores the urgent need for strengthened antimicrobial stewardship and infection control measures in neonatal intensive care units."
41408176,Neonatal fungemia: a case series highlighting the threat posed by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species and a yeast-like filamentous fungus.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal fungemia represents a substantial contributor to morbidity and mortality in 25-30% of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), particularly affecting preterm or low-birth-weight infants. The immune systems of neonates, particularly those who are preterm, are underdeveloped, making them highly susceptible to infections like fungemia. CASES: In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), bloodstream infections (BSIs) were identified in 18 out of 72 cases, accounting for 25% of the total. Of these, five cases were attributed to fungal infections, constituting 27.7% of all infections over the past three months. This report concentrates on these five neonatal cases, which were diagnosed with fungemia, a form of bloodstream infection caused by Candida and yeast-like filamentous fungi, particularly affecting newborns. The non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, specifically Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida pelliculosa, as well as the arthroconidial yeast-like filamentous fungus Saprochaete capitata, have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. A significant proportion of these cases were outborn, with potential associations to risk factors such as maternal vaginal candidiasis or lapses in infection control measures during childbirth. All cases were identified within the first week of life and were consequently classified as early-onset neonatal sepsis. In addition to maternal risk factors, several neonates were delivered preterm, exhibited low birth weight, experienced respiratory distress, and required ventilatory support. Unfortunately, only two cases resulted in recovery and discharge, while the remaining three did not survive. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The prompt identification and management of conditions are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. This study highlights the critical role of non-albicans Candida species and other yeast-like invasive fungi as key factors in the onset of early neonatal sepsis within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)."
41407497,Glucose-6-phosphate transporter deficiency (GSD type Ib) in an infant with an ominous outcome.,2025,"A male infant presented with progressive abdominal distension, diarrhoea, fever and respiratory distress. Examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, doll-like facies, thin extremities and oral/perianal rash. His history included recurrent pneumonia. By day six, he developed severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, requiring mechanical ventilation. Despite antibiotic therapy, he suffered persistent infections including sepsis, UTI and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Genetic testing confirmed glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib), identifying a homozygous splice site variant in intron 9 of the SLC37A4 gene. This case highlights the immune dysfunction-neutropenia and neutrophil impairment-associated with GSD-Ib, contributing to increased infection susceptibility and poor response to treatment. Genetic counselling and prenatal testing were recommended."
41407496,"Neisseria meningitidis bacteraemia and lobar pneumonia in a previously healthy, fully immunised (including meningococcal vaccines) Irish teenager.",2025,"An adolescent female patient presented to the Emergency Department of a large tertiary hospital in Ireland, with a 1-day history of chest and left axillary pain, and a 5-day history of productive cough, fever, reduced oral intake and lethargy; no previous medical history, sick contacts or recent travel. Vaccinations were up to date. Symptomatology, raised inflammatory markers, radiographic findings, coupled with relevant auscultatory findings, led to a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Less than 24 hours after presentation, Neisseria meningitidis was isolated from a blood culture, prompting patient isolation and commencement of high-dose ceftriaxone. Close contacts received prophylaxis, and public health authorities were notified. Meningococcal pneumonia, although infrequently seen in adults, has been reported in the paediatric population to date only rarely. This case serves as a reminder that meningococcal disease is notifiable, requiring prompt reporting to public health authorities, patient isolation and prophylaxis for close contacts. It also highlights meningococcal pneumonia as a cause of paediatric pneumonia, even in fully vaccinated, immunocompetent children, and the importance of obtaining blood samples for culture before commencing antibiotic therapy to maximise microbiological confirmation."
41407463,[The clinical study of azacitidine and lenalidomide combination in myelodysplastic neoplasm patients with TP53 mutations].,2025,"Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of azacitidine combined with lenalidomide in MDS patients and explore potential mechanisms of therapeutic response. Methods: Sixteen MDS patients with TP53 mutations received azacitidine plus lenalidomide at ZhongDa Hospital, Southeast University (January 2021-June 2025). Efficacy and safety were assessed, and TP53 mutation status was correlated with treatment response. Whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics were used to explore molecular biomarkers associated with therapeutic efficacy. Results: Sixteen patients (median age 69.5 years, range 52-82; 8 males, 8 females) were enrolled. According to the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M), 1, 2, and 13 patients were classified as median low, high, and very high risk, respectively. Among 16 TP53-mutated patients, 11 had biallelic mutations and 5 had monoallelic mutations. Overall response rate was 56.3% (9/16), composite complete remission rate (CRc) was 31.3% (5/16), and hematology improvement rate was 25% (4/16). Among TP53-mutated patients, the response rate was 56.3% (9/16), with variant allele frequency dropping from 65.6% to 16.5% in responders (P=0.017). In patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotype, response rate was 53.8% (7/13), with 57.1% (4/7) showing disappearance of CK post-treatment. The most common grade 3-4 nonhematologic adverse events were infections (9/16, 56.3% ), including pneumonia (4/16, 25.0% ), gastrointestinal infections (3/16, 18.8% ), perianal infections (1/16, 6.3% ) and sepsis (1/16, 6.3% ). High CBX8 expression may be linked to treatment response. Conclusion: Azacitidine plus lenalidomide is an effective and safe therapy for MDS, including patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotypes. Treatment markedly reduces TP53 variant allele frequency in responders, and high CBX8 expression may predict therapeutic response."
41407454,[Advancing the development of hematology care units to enhance hematology‑specific critical care capacity].,2025,"Establishing hematology care units (HCU) is essential for strengthening hematology-specific critical care capacity. This article outlines two HCU operational models in China-the ICU model and the pre-ICU model-and discusses practical insights from their implementation. It recommends establishing HCU within hematology wards, equipped for respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring and blood purification, and led by hematologists trained in critical care or by teams collaborating efficiently with general ICU through standardized workflows. For units not yet meeting these standards, establishing a resuscitation room and strengthening critical care training are advised. HCU primarily admit patients with severe or life-threatening bleeding due to hematologic diseases, severe infections or septic shock, early complications of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML/APL), treatment-related complications, rapidly progressive or highly lethal conditions, and those requiring organ support or blood purification. Emphasis is placed on quantitative assessment of disease severity and timely transfer to the HCU, using tools such as the National Early Warning Score, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), SOFA/DeltaSOFA, and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer risk index for patient stratification. Early implementation of sepsis bundles is emphasized. For organ support, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is prioritized to improve oxygenation. Continuous renal replacement therapy is performed when there are indications such as renal failure with oliguria or anuria, congestive heart failure, or drug overdose, etc. Treatment of the underlying hematologic disease follows a ""three-tier stratification"" and ""watch-and-adjust"" strategy, while respecting patient preferences. We encourage eligible hematology centers to actively establish HCU, explore new care models, and strengthen hematology-specific critical care capacity."
41406547,Emergent Laparotomy for Blunt Trauma: Operating on Frail Older Adults Goes Beyond the Operating Room.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is prevalent among geriatric patients and is a risk factor for worse outcomes in this population. The aim of this study is to provide setting-specific evidence by comparing outcomes of emergent laparotomy between frail and nonfrail geriatric blunt trauma patients. METHODS: A 5-y (2017-2021) retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program was performed. Older adult (age >/=65 y) blunt trauma patients who underwent emergent laparotomy were included and stratified using the 11-factor modified frailty index into frail (F) and nonfrail (NF) groups. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), and major complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, sepsis, surgical site infection, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounding factors, were performed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1655 geriatric blunt trauma patients who underwent laparotomy (F: 273, NF: 1382). The mean age was 74 (7) y and 66% were male. The median injury severity score was 14 [9-25] and the median time to laparotomy was 112 [52-223] min. There was no significant difference in terms of injury characteristics and time to laparotomy between F and NF groups. On univariate analysis, there was no difference in terms of mortality (P = 0.161), intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.204), and major complications (P = 0.969); however, F group had significantly longer median hospital LOS (F: 10 [5-15] versus NF: 8 [2-14], P = 0.001). On multivariable regression analysis, F group was independently associated with higher odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.665, 95% confidence interval [1.194-2.321], P = 0.003) and longer hospital LOS (beta: +2.131, 95% confidence interval [+0.492 to +3.771], P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults undergoing emergent laparotomy after blunt trauma, frailty identifies patients at increased risk of in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay; incorporating frailty assessment at presentation can guide perioperative counseling and resource planning."
41406025,Comparison of the VITEK REVEAL AST and Accelerate Pheno systems for fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative blood cultures at a large academic health system.,2026,"Timely initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial for patients with Gram-negative (GN) blood stream infections. In this study, the performance of VITEK REVEAL (bioMerieux, USA), an FDA cleared in vitro diagnostic automated system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) directly from positive blood culture (BC), was compared to that of Accelerate Pheno (Accelerate Diagnostics, USA), as standard of care method. 128 GN positive BCs were analyzed according to manufacturer recommendations, comparing time to result (TTR) and AST results. The categorical agreement (CA) rate between VITEK REVEAL and Accelerate Pheno was 94.3% and the essential agreement (EA) rate was 96.0%. Very major discrepancies (VMD), major discrepancies (MD), and minor discrepancies (miD) rates between the systems were 7.5%, 0.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. Lastly, we observed a mean sequential TTR (reporting of AST results per antibiotic in real-time) on VITEK REVEAL of 6.1 h (3.0-8.2) and mean final TTR of 7.9 h (6.5-8.2), compared to Accelerate Pheno, with a significantly shorter mean final TTR of 7.1 h (6.8-7.7). Sequential TTR on VITEK REVEAL was significantly shorter for resistant isolates (those with >/=1 'Resistant' antimicrobial-organism combination interpretation, using FDA STIC 2024 or CLSI M100 criteria) compared to susceptible/intermediate ones, with a mean difference of 1.4 h (P  <  0.001). Overall, compared to Accelerate Pheno, VITEK REVEAL displayed high %CA and %EA for AST of GN bacteria directly from positive BC. Also, unlike Accelerate Pheno, VITEK REVEAL reports MIC results in real time, allowing an earlier release of actionable information useful for antimicrobial stewardship. IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have compared the performance of the VITEK REVEAL, system for fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to conventional, non-rapid microbiology methods. To evaluate how the VITEK REVEAL correlates to similarly available fast, direct-from-blood culture AST technologies, this study aimed to compare it to the Accelerate Pheno system, as standard of care method. High categorical agreement (94.3%) and essential agreement (96.0%) between the two systems were observed, underscoring their reliability. The VITEK REVEAL has the advantage of real-time AST reporting, unlike the Accelerate Pheno. Ultimately, this study supports the need for and continued optimization of fast diagnostic technologies for AST, contributing to the goal of advancing antimicrobial stewardship-focused treatment strategies and improving the prognosis of patients with bloodstream infections."
41405037,Risk for sepsis during mechanical circulatory support bigstar.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) risk the development of sepsis. Examining risk factors for the development of sepsis and their relationships to MCS may allow for an improved understanding of these complications. METHODS: Following IRB approval, patient characteristics, previously reported comorbidities, and the incidence of sepsis were studied in 199 patients who received 244 MCS therapies from January 2017 to October 2023. The clinical variables underwent ensemble machine learning modeling. Significant comorbidities predicting sepsis from the ensemble machine modeling underwent decision-tree analysis. RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of sepsis was 20% (95% CI: 16-26%). Following machine learning modeling, patients with a history of congestive heart failure or a history of previous cardiac surgery were associated with an increased risk for developing sepsis. The c-index statistic for this model was 0.76, with a misclassification rate of 19%. Decision-tree analysis observed that patients without chronic cardiovascular disease but with a history of prior cardiac surgery have a 60.3% (95% CI: 60.1-65.2%) incidence of sepsis during MCS therapy. Patients with a history of chronic cardiovascular disease and with a history of congestive heart failure have an 18.1% (95% CI: 17.2-18.7%) incidence of developing sepsis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of sepsis is high in this patient population. The novel associations of patients who have histories of congestive heart failure or previous cardiac surgery requiring MCS suggest an increased systemic inflammatory state exists that escalates the risk for developing sepsis. Further investigation into these background inflammatory conditions in patients requiring MCS is warranted."
41404875,Precise species identification and whole-genome sequencing analysis of Enterobacter cloacae complex causing bloodstream infections in China.,2026,"The Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired infections. However, achieving accurate species identification and comprehensive resistance profiling remains difficult in clinical practice, with a limited understanding of species-specific resistance patterns. ECC isolates were collected from patients with bloodstream infections at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2015 and 2020. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify species, analyze antimicrobial resistance genes, and explore genomic variation in serial isolates. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profiles were extracted from the WGS data. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on hsp60 sequences. Eleven hsp60 clusters were identified, with cluster VIII being the most prevalent (28/108). Average nucleotide identity (ANI)-based species classification showed Enterobacter hormaechei (31.5%) and Enterobacter xiangfangensis (15.7%) were dominant species. Five clade-cluster pairs (B-VIII, A-VI, G-XI, D-III, R-IX) accounted for 74% of isolates. A total of 90 sequence types (STs) were detected, including 29 novel STs. Resistance gene analysis revealed a high prevalence of bla(ACT), with distinct distribution patterns observed among different species. Twenty isolates were carbapenem-resistant, with three carrying bla(NDM-1/5). Enterobacter roggenkampii was the most common species (5/20) among all carbapenem-resistant isolates, and 83.3% of the isolates showed resistance to both carbapenems and colistin. Comparative genomics of longitudinal isolates from individual patients revealed adaptive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pco genes. This study provides a detailed genomic characterization of ECC isolates from bloodstream infections, highlighting species diversity, resistance gene distribution, and potential within-host evolution. These insights advocate genome-based surveillance in managing ECC infections and understanding resistance evolution in clinical contexts.IMPORTANCEEnterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) is a major cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, yet species-level identification and resistance profiling remain challenging. As one of the largest whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based studies of ECC bloodstream isolates in northern China to date, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 108 ECC isolates, revealing high genetic diversity and identifying 29 novel sequence types. We clarified the correspondence between species, clades, and clusters and highlighted Enterobacter roggenkampii as a potential high-risk species linked to carbapenem and colistin resistance. Our findings not only improve the understanding of ECC population structure and resistance evolution in China but also provide valuable genomic data for future epidemiological surveillance and species-level diagnostics."
41404282,Immune subphenotypes of tuberculosis and mortality in adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis causes high mortality among people living with HIV in Africa, yet immune response data are limited. We identified immune subphenotypes of adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa. METHODS: We determined the association of serum cytokine and antibody concentrations with CD4+ T-cell and blood lactate concentration, tuberculosis, and 30-day mortality with K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and logistic regression. We validated results in a separate cohort of adults with sepsis in East Africa. RESULTS: Of 208 participants in the discovery cohort, 117 (56%) were female and 175 (84%) were living with HIV, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 35 (+/-10) years. Participants with tuberculosis had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1MCAF, whereas mortality was associated with higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP-1beta, and lower concentrations of IgM antibodies against oxidation-specific epidopes (IgM (OSE) ). PCA identified G-CSF, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 as the main contributors to tuberculosis, and IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-13 as the main contributors to mortality. Comprehensive biomarker and clinical and multivariable models accurately predicted tuberculosis (AUC = 0.84) and mortality (AUC = 0.78), which was replicated in the validation cohort. Cross-testing showed that the tuberculosis model delineated pathogen-specific immune activation, while the mortality model represented non-pathogen-specific immune dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with sepsis and high HIV prevalence in East Africa, tuberculosis was associated with pathogen-specific inflammation, and mortality was associated with broader immune dysregulation and diminished IgM (OSE) antibody responses."
41404251,"A Comparison of Clinical, Neonatal, and Maternal Factors Between Early- and Late-Onset Group B Streptococcal Disease.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Universal group B streptococcus (GBS) screening in pregnant people and maternal antibiotic prophylaxis have reduced the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcus (EOGBS) infection. Despite a lower incidence, there is still a high risk of morbidity and mortality without treatment, and there is limited knowledge about late-onset group B streptococcus (LOGBS) infection. Using statewide neonatal sepsis surveillance and hospital admission data, this study describes factors associated with EOGBS and LOGBS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study combined statewide surveillance data for infants with GBS through Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) data between 2006 and 2020. Cases were defined as EOGBS (>7 days of age) or LOGBS (7-89 days of age). Chi-square tests and the Mann-Whitney test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 322 identified cases, 106 (32.9%) were EOGBS, and 216 (67.1%) were LOGBS. LOGBS had a higher rate of meningitis (n = 65, 30.1%) compared to EOGBS (n = 11, 10.4%) (p > 0.001) and had a higher percentage of diagnosis via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 51, 23.6%) compared to EOGBS (n = 5, 4.7%; p < 0.001). LOGBS were more likely to receive maternal antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis (n = 129, 61.1%) compared to EOGBS (n = 49, 46.2%; p = 0.012) and more doses of maternal antibiotics (3.39 doses) compared to EOGBS (1.59 doses, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in epidemiology and clinical manifestations of EOGBS and LOGBS support different approaches to prevent each entity. Strategies for EOGBS prevention include maternal antibiotic prophylaxis and maternal screening. The transmission and pathogenesis of LOGBS are likely different than EOGBS, creating a need for different preventative strategies. Potential mechanisms to prevent LOGBS include maternal vaccination."
41404203,Sepsis-Induced Myocardial Dysfunction and Its Prognostic Implications for Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of morbidity in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, yet its direct impact on mortality remains uncertain. This systematic review synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the association between SIMD and outcomes in septic patients. Echocardiographic and biomarker-based assessments consistently demonstrated that SIMD is a frequent and often reversible complication of sepsis, associated with greater disease severity and impaired hemodynamics. Pharmacological interventions such as levosimendan and Xinmailong infusion were found to improve surrogate measures of cardiac function, yet none conferred a significant survival benefit at 28 days. While advanced imaging modalities like speckle-tracking echocardiography enhanced diagnostic sensitivity, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and outcome definitions limited the strength of pooled conclusions. Overall, SIMD appears to be a clinically relevant marker of illness severity, but current evidence does not establish it as an independent predictor of mortality. Larger multicenter trials with standardized diagnostic frameworks and long-term follow-up are required to clarify its prognostic role and to determine whether targeted therapies can alter patient outcomes."
41403607,Causal associations of circulating inflammatory proteins with sepsis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis arises from dysregulated inflammation in response to infection, precipitating organ dysfunction. Circulating inflammatory mediators likely contribute to sepsis pathogenesis, but their precise roles remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate potential causal impacts of inflammatory proteins on sepsis risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization study evaluating causal associations for 91 inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. Genetic instruments were derived from a published genome-wide association study of plasma proteins. Sepsis outcome data were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen cohort. Inverse-variance weighted analysis was conducted along with several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The analyses identified significant causal associations for several inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. TRAIL exhibited a causal effect on increased overall sepsis risk (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17). CCL28 showed a causal link to higher 28-day sepsis mortality in critical care (OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.18-9.29). CCL4 demonstrated a causal association with increased 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06-1.31). Meanwhile, beta-NGF was found to be causally protective for sepsis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99), and TNFB also showed a causally protective effect (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates roles of inflammatory mediators in sepsis pathogenesis. The identified proteins may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. TRAIL signaling inhibition may hold promise for future clinical translation given its causal links to increased sepsis risk and mortality. CCL28 and CCL4 also represent potential immunological drivers of sepsis mortality worthy of further investigation. Meanwhile, the neurotrophins beta-NGF and TNFB emerged as having protective effects in sepsis that could be therapeutically augmented. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm the observed causal relationships. Our findings provide targets for future mechanistic and clinical examination to impact patient prognosis."
41402810,"Determinants of surgical management outcomes among adult patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu central hospital, Malawi.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Intestinal obstruction causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings. Understanding factors influencing surgical outcomes is crucial for improving patient care. This study aimed to assess the determinants of surgical management outcomes among adult patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu Central Hospital, Malawi. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 262 adult patients diagnosed with intestinal obstruction between July 2021 and June 2024. Data were collected through patient chart reviews, focusing on demographic characteristics, care- and disease-related factors, and outcomes of surgical management (death and discharge). Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise patient characteristics, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of surgical outcomes, with statistical significance set at p </= 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 46.6 +/- 19.2 years (range, 15-94 years). The overall mortality rate was 39(14.9%), whereas 223(85.1%) were successfully discharged, and 30(16.2%) developed wound infections. The average duration of illness before admission was 5.0 +/- 7.5 days, and the average hospital stay was 10.6 +/- 9.3 days. Most patients, 138(52.7%), presented with small bowel obstruction, predominantly due to adhesions, 63(24.0%) and viable small intestinal volvulus, 24(9.3%). Among patients with large bowel obstruction, the leading causes were viable sigmoid volvulus, 39(14.1%) and gangrenous sigmoid volvulus, 28(10.7%). In the bivariate analysis, variables such as age, ASA score, malaria test results, haemoglobin levels, preoperative sepsis, and abdominal distension had p-values < 0.25 and were therefore included in the multivariable logistic regression model. After adjustment, only ASA score >/= III [AOR = 5.05, 95% CI: 1.86-13.60; p < 0.001] and abdominal distension [AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 0.99-5.61; p = 0.050] remained independently associated with unfavourable surgical outcomes. CONCLUSION: An ASA score >/= III and clinical manifestation of abdominal distension are key determinants of unfavourable surgical management outcomes in patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu Central Hospital. Strengthening perioperative assessment and timely surgical intervention are recommended to enhance the patient outcomes."
41402768,Outcomes of pull-through surgery among children with Hirschsprung's disease in Tanzania: a comparative study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) has been performed through different techniques throughout the surgical history. All techniques evolve through a process of seeking optimal surgical outcomes. Our center has been using two main techniques to address the effects of Swenson and Rehbein's procedure. Reports are inconclusive regarding which technique provides optimal outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review and compare outcomes between Swenson's and Rehbein's procedures in a sub-Saharan African cohort. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients who underwent Pullthrough (PT) surgery at a tertiary hospital. The primary outcome of the study was bowel performance following surgery. Chi X(2) and Fisher's exact tests were used. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to detect any associations among the outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 55 patients were reviewed, and 49 were analyzed. These patients underwent surgery between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2020. Thirty-one patients underwent the Swenson procedure. A total of 75% of the patients who underwent Swenson's procedure had good bowel performance after surgery, whereas only 33% of those who underwent the Rehbein's procedure had good bowel performance (p = 0.01). The two procedures were comparable in terms of the amount of time needed. The complication rate was higher in Rehbein's procedure (77%, 14/19) than in Swenson's procedure (41%, 13/31). Constipation and residual aganglionotic segments were found mainly during Rehbein's procedure. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The Swenson pull-through technique demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the Rehbein procedure, with fewer postoperative complications and improved bowel function. These findings support the Swenson approach as the preferred surgical option in our setting. Nonetheless, prospective studies are recommended to validate these results and explore long-term functional outcomes."
41402726,Comparison of invasive and noninvasive blood pressure measurements in critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Blood pressure monitoring is crucial in critically ill patients, with invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP) recognized as the gold standard. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) is widely used but may differ from IABP, particularly in patients receiving norepinephrine. This study evaluated the agreement between IABP and NIBP and the impact of the norepinephrine dosage on the accuracy of NIBP in septic shock patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a 36-bed ICU (April 2022-April 2023) and included 84 patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine. IABP was measured via a radial artery catheter, and NIBP was recorded simultaneously from the contralateral arm. Patients were grouped by norepinephrine dose: </= 0.25, 0.25-0.50, and >/= 0.50 mcg/kg/min. Agreement was assessed via Bland-Altman and error grid analyses, with a focus on the mean blood pressure (MBP) thresholds (>/= 65 mmHg and < 65 mmHg). RESULTS: Among the 2,104 paired measurements, significant discrepancies were observed between the IABP and NIBP across all dose groups(p < 0.001). Discrepancies increased with higher norepinephrine doses, particularly at an MBP >/= 65 mmHg, with biases of -3.89 mmHg (</= 0.25 mcg/kg/min) and - 6.81 mmHg (>/= 0.50 mcg/kg/min). Error grid analysis revealed that 47.2% of MBP >/= 65 mmHg measurements fell into clinically significant risk zones (B-E) at high doses. In patients aged > 65 years, significant differences were observed in all pressures (p < 0.001), whereas younger patients showed discrepancies only in the mean and diastolic pressures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant discrepancies between IABP and NIBP in critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine, particularly at higher doses and in patients with MBP >/= 65 mmHg. These findings highlight the limitations of NIBP monitoring in this population and support the importance of IABP monitoring in selected high-risk patients, while suggesting that NIBP monitoring may remain acceptable in more hemodynamically stable individuals. Applying these considerations in clinical practice may help optimize blood pressure monitoring strategies in the ICU."
41402639,Cardiorespiratory signatures of necrotizing enterocolitis: a 4-NICU study of very low birth weight infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder in very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) infants, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Earlier detection of NEC may improve outcomes. We hypothesized that NEC's physiological signature resembles that of sepsis and that our model developed for sepsis, the Pulse Oximetry Warning System (POWS), would also predict NEC. OBJECTIVES: Assess relationships between continuous heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) features and NEC risk, and evaluate POWS performance for predicting medical and surgical NEC. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter analysis, we studied VLBW infants at four level IV NICUs, identifying cases of late-onset sepsis (LOS) and NEC (Bell stages 2 or 3). Using HR and SpO(2) data, we calculated features and POWS scores and assessed associations with NEC and LOS risk. RESULTS: Among 3914 infants evaluated, 5% had NEC and 13% had LOS. Cardiorespiratory data analysis showed that HR/SpO(2) patterns had similar risk associations with NEC and LOS. POWS AUC was 0.758 for NEC, 0.804 for sepsis, 0.791 for NEC or LOS, and 0.808 for NEC requiring surgery. CONCLUSION: NEC shares a cardiorespiratory signature with LOS. POWS predicted NEC with a dynamic rise before clinical diagnosis. IMPACT: A cardiorespiratory early warning score analyzing heart rate and oxygen saturation, trained to predict late-onset sepsis within 24h across, predicts necrotizing enterocolitis. Heart rate and oxygen saturation features had the same patterns of association with necrotizing enterocolitis as sepsis. The results increase understanding of physiologic signatures of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis."
41402459,Outcomes of septic shock from urinary and non-urinary sources in nonagenarians and centenarians admitted to intensive care units.,2025,"Although sepsis-related mortality has declined with advances in care, the incidence of septic shock is rising by 1-8% annually. As life expectancy increases, the >/= 90-year-old population is projected to reach 10 million in the U.S. by 2050, highlighting septic shock as a growing public health burden. Despite urinary tract infections being a common cause, non-urinary sources may carry higher mortality. However, outcome data in nonagenarians and centenarians are limited. This study compares outcomes by infection source in ICU patients aged 90 years or older with septic shock. This retrospective study, approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee (No. 253/24), used de-identified data from the ANZICS Adult Patient Database (2010-2023), including nonagenarian and centenarian ICU patients with septic shock. Variables included demographics, comorbidities, frailty, severity scores, and 24-h biomarkers. Outcomes were mortality by infection source and length of stay. Propensity score matching ensured covariate balance. Time-dependent Cox models and AUROC analysis were used. Complete case analysis was performed, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Among 1095 ICU patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher short-term mortality compared to urinary sources, even after propensity matching (300-day HR 1.348; p = 0.012). ICU mortality (15.7% vs. 8.6%) and hospital mortality (29.0% vs. 17.3%) were also higher in the non-urinary group. APACHE III score, but not age or SOFA score, predicted mortality. Urine output and arterial pH were the best mortality discriminators for non-urinary and urinary sources, respectively. Higher SOFA and APACHE III scores were linked to shorter hospital stays, but not ICU length of stay. In critically ill patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, infection source was an independent, time-dependent predictor of mortality. Non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher mortality than urinary tract infections for the first 300 days, despite comparable illness severity. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of infection source and its role in early risk stratification, triage, and end-of-life planning. Simple physiological markers, including urine output and arterial pH, demonstrated additional discriminatory value. As the very elderly ICU population grows, integrating infection source and early physiological indicators into tailored prognostic tools is essential to guide individualized, efficient care in high-resource critical care settings."
41402196,"Impact of the francophone pediatric intensive care group bronchiolitis recommendations on diagnostic testing, antibiotic therapy and patient prognosis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is a common viral infection in infants, with severe cases requiring admission to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). While bacterial co-infections are rare, timely diagnosis and management are essential. Updated guidelines from the French-speaking Group of Pediatric Intensive and Emergency Care (GFRUP) aim to standardize the standard of care, reducing unnecessary interventions. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the impact of updated bronchiolitis management guidelines on sepsis incidence, diagnostic test use, and antibiotic prescriptions in a single center. METHODS AND SETTINGS: A retrospective study compared two epidemic periods (2022-2023 and 2023-2024) at the PICU, Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. Clinical and microbiological data, including sepsis incidence, bacterial co-infections, diagnostic tests, and antibiotic use, were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 257 infants admitted for bronchiolitis, sepsis incidence remained low (8% vs. 7%). Implementation of the guidelines led to a significant reduction in additional diagnostic tests (65% vs. 49%, p = 0.013). Antibiotic prescription rates were unchanged, but a narrower spectrum of antibiotics was observed, with decreased amoxicillin/clavulanate use and increased amoxicillin prescriptions. Lung infections were the most frequent bacterial co-infections, with no rise in bacterial infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of updated guidelines reduced unnecessary diagnostic tests and promoted narrower-spectrum antibiotic use without increasing sepsis incidence. These findings highlight the potential of evidence-based guidelines to optimize care, support antibiotic stewardship, and minimize unnecessary interventions in pediatric critical care."
41401657,Metformin diminishes lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy: Molecular insights on vascular endothelial growth factor-A and its receptors.,2026,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a hypoxia- and cytokine-inducible biomarker of endothelial activation, together with its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, contributes to endotoxemia and early sepsis-related vascular dysfunction by increasing permeability and tissue edema. The current research explored the dose-dependent therapeutic effects of metformin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia with cardiopulmonary dysfunction and microvascular coagulopathy in male Wistar rats. Endotoxemia was induced by a single intraperitoneal LPS injection, and metformin was administered at 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg. Metformin dose-dependently improved survival and attenuated LPS-induced tachycardia, QTc prolongation, ST-segment elevation, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and elevations in serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced VEGF-A, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 expression in cardiopulmonary tissues, with the 400 mg/kg dose nearly restoring normal levels. KEGG and Reactome analyses revealed that VEGFR2 activation drives PI3K-Akt-eNOS, p38/HSP27, and MAPK/ERK pathways promoting endothelial permeability, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Molecular docking further confirmed potential interactions between metformin and key VEGF signaling proteins-VEGFR2, MAPK1, PDK1, and Src kinase-through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, supporting the predicted inhibitory mechanism. STRING protein-protein interaction analysis identified VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4) as central hubs linking angiogenic and adaptor proteins. Collectively, these experimental and computational findings indicate that metformin ameliorates LPS-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy via modulation of VEGF-A/VEGFR1/VEGFR2 signaling, providing mechanistic and translational insight into its potential endothelial-protective effects especially in comorbid patients on metformin maintenance therapy."
41401655,Tocilizumab for super-refractory status epilepticus in children with FIRES: A case series.,2026,"PURPOSE: Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy that can occur at any age, with limited treatment options. Conventional immunotherapies often show poor efficacy. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the interleukin-6 receptor blocker, tocilizumab, in children with FIRES. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging of seven children with FIRES treated at our center between 2018 and 2022. Outcomes included cessation of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), seizure burden, and functional outcome using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scale. RESULTS: Seven previously healthy children (median age 9 years; range 2-13) developed SRSE following febrile illness. Extensive investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid studies, viral panels, and autoimmune testing were negative, consistent with cryptogenic FIRES. Initial MRI was normal in six children; one showed symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving deep grey matter structures. All patients received a multimodal therapeutic strategy including intravenous midazolam, high-dose phenobarbitone, ketogenic diet, therapeutic hypothermia, and/or immunotherapy-prior to tocilizumab. Intravenous tocilizumab was initiated at a median of 17 days from illness onset (range 6-46). SRSE resolved within a median of 5 days (range 2-12) after administration. At 6-month follow-up, six of seven patients developed chronic epilepsy, characterised by weekly to monthly seizures, while one remained seizure free. Functional recovery was noted in four patients, each achieving a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score of </=2. Adverse events included grade 2 leukopenia or diarrhoea (n = 3) and grade 4 sepsis (n = 1); all resolved with treatment. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab was associated with rapid resolution of SRSE, seizure reduction, and functional recovery in children with FIRES, with manageable side effects. While causality cannot be confirmed given concurrent therapies and variable timing of administration, these findings support consideration of interleukin-6 blockade as a potential adjunctive treatment in FIRES."
41400853,"Risk factors for ICD-10-coded Respiratory Syncytial Virus-associated deaths in hospitalized patients in Germany before the COVID-19 pandemic (nationwide in-patient data, 2010-2019).",2026,"PURPOSE: We compared nationwide data on the clinical characteristics of deceased and non-deceased patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-coded hospitalization to evaluate potential risk factors for in-hospital fatality by age group. METHODS: Data from International Statistical Classification of Diseases (10th Revision)-based German Hospital Statistics for patients from 2010-2019 with a primary discharge diagnosis code for RSV-related pneumonia (J12.1), bronchitis (J20.5) or bronchiolitis (J21.0) were assessed by remote data retrieval. Selected underlying conditions and complications were reported stratified by age group and outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 612 (0.3% of 205,352) RSV-coded patients died in hospital (103 children < 18 years, 51 adults 18-59 years, 458 seniors > 59 years). Children and adults with underlying chronic cardiovascular, neurological, immunological, or lower respiratory diseases had a higher risk of dying than those without (Odds Ratio 109, 58, 28, 6 in children, and 3, 3, 3, 2 in adults). In seniors, the risk was increased for patients with chronic neurological conditions (OR 1.3) but not for other underlying conditions. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and pneumonia increased the risk of a fatal outcome in all age groups. CONCLUSION: In-hospital fatality of RSV-coded patients varied considerably with age, chronic conditions and complications. Seniors were the most affected age group and may therefore benefit from the RSV vaccination recommended in Germany since 2024 for all over 75 years and seniors with pre-existing conditions."
41400774,Stable Nationwide Sepsis-Related Mortality Does Not Extend to Individuals with Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sepsis remains highly fatal despite national improvements from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign; furthermore, its effects on patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are not well understood. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-raning Online Data for Epidemiological Research (CDC WONDER) death certificate data from 2011 to 2020, we identified deaths with sepsis as the underlying cause and ALD as a contributing cause. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated overall and by sex, race/ethnicity, region, and urbanization level. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2020, a total of 2357 sepsis-related deaths occurred among ALD patients in the United States (U.S.) While sepsis-related mortality in the overall population remained stable (APC: - 0.88%, 95% CI [confidence interval] - 2.00 to 0.25%), it increased significantly in ALD patients (APC: 8.86%, 95% CI 5.07 to 12.79%). Mortality increased in both sexes, with mortality in females (APC: 9.68%, 95% CI 4.58 to 15.03%) increasing more pronouncedly than in males (APC: 7.79%, 95% CI 4.13 to 11.58%). AAMRs from sepsis-related mortality in ALD individuals increased in the Midwest (APC: 10.77%, 95% CI 4.58 to 17.33%), South (APC: 6.78%, 95% CI 0.26 to 13.73%), and West (APC: 7.35%, 95% CI 3.16 to 11.71%) census areas while remaining stable in the Northeast census area. CONCLUSION: Despite sepsis-related mortality in the U.S. population remaining stable, rates among ALD patients have increased over the past decade. These patterns underscore disparities and the need for targeted interventions such as enhancing early sepsis detection, expanding specialty access, and strengthening alcohol use treatment pathways."
41400206,Sepsis and mucositis-related biomarkers in adult hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia.,2025,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of chemotherapy and potentially fatal. It is often associated with mucositis. Timely recognition of complications enables early supportive treatment and potentially reduces mortality. Common diagnostic parameters are often nonspecific or have slow kinetics. This study examines the applicability of mucosa-related biomarkers in the recognition of complicated course among 78 adult hematologic patients with FN after intensive chemotherapy. Plasma concentrations of citrulline, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)AGP), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were measured at the onset of fever and the following two days. All except ZO-1 showed a significant trend. Concentrations of CRP, PCT, citrulline and alpha(1)AGP were higher with a complicated course. Patients with severe sepsis had higher levels of PCT and lower levels of I-FABP. In conclusion, measurement of mucosa-related biomarkers might help predict the course of FN."
41399838,"[Epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and microbiology of suppurative pyelonephritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis, part 1].",2025,"INTRODUCTION: The first part of a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing the problem of purulent pyelonephritis is presented in the article. AIM: To analyze the epidemiology, predisposing factors, diagnostic approaches, and microbiological characteristics of purulent pyelonephritis, which is a complicated form of acute pyelonephritis characterized by renal parenchymal suppuration, sepsis, or localized abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of 46 studies (1981-2024) on complicated pyelonephritis was performed. The review included clinical series (observational and one randomized trial) with more or equal 10 patients reporting on prevalence, risk factors, clinical course, diagnostic approaches, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes of severe pyelonephritis. Data were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis of key outcomes (mortality and need for surgical intervention) was carried out using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most common serious urinary tract infections, with an annual incidence of 15-17 per 10,000 women and 3-5 per 10,000 men. In most cases, the disease responds well to antibiotic therapy; however, in 20-30% of patients complicated pyelonephritis develops. Predisposing factors include diabetes mellitus, urinary tract obstruction, advanced age, male sex, immunodeficiency, and pregnancy. Diabetes mellitus is present in 30-35% of hospitalized patients with pyelonephritis (vs. 10-15% in uncomplicated cases) and in 75-95% of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis. Urolithiasis accounts for approximately 20% of cases with complicated pyelonephritis. Elderly (>65 years) and male patients are affected less frequently but experience more severe disease: men constitute only about 25% of acute pyelonephritis cases but have higher rates of abscess and sepsis. Purulent pyelonephritis is typically associated with pronounced systemic symptoms: high fever (>39 C in 70% of cases), chills (50-60%), and septic shock (25-30% upon admission). In 15-20% of severe cases, local urinary symptoms (flank pain, dysuria) are absent. Laboratory findings usually demonstrate leukocytosis >15109/L (80%) or, conversely, leukopenia <4109/L (20-30%) in cases with disseminated intravascular coagulation, along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (>100 mg/L). Imaging plays a decisive role: ultrasound can detect hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis, whereas contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the gold standard for detecting abscesses and gas formation. The main pathogens of complicated pyelonephritis are Gram-negative enteric bacteria, primarily Escherichia coli (60-75%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10-15%), and Proteus mirabilis (5-10%). In 10-30% of cases, isolates exhibit multidrug resistance (e.g., ESBL-producing strains). Polymicrobial infection occurs in approximately 5-10% of severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: Purulent pyelonephritis is a relatively uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of renal infection, strongly associated with risk factors such as diabetes and urinary obstruction. Improved patient outcomes depend on early identification of high-risk individuals, timely imaging to detect purulent complications, and empirical antibiotic therapy that accounts for likely antimicrobial resistance (treatment strategies and outcomes will be discussed in Part 2 of this review)."
41399648,Prognostic Value of the Albumin Corrected Anion Gap in ICU Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Sepsis: A MIMIC-IV Cohort Study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at increased risk of sepsis, a condition associated with high mortality. The anion gap (AG) is commonly used to assess acid-base disturbances, but its reliability declines in hypoalbuminemia. The albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) may provide greater accuracy, yet its prognostic value in COPD patients with sepsis, defined according to Sepsis-3 criteria, remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2072 ICU patients with COPD and sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). Cox regression models evaluated the association between ACAG and mortality, Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated survival differences, restricted cubic splines examined nonlinear relationships, and subgroup analyses assessed consistency across strata. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared the predictive performance of ACAG, AG, and serum albumin. RESULTS: Elevated ACAG was independently associated with both short- and long-term mortality. In fully adjusted models, each 1 mmol/L increase in ACAG was linked to higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR 1.064, 95% CI 1.042-1.086, P < 0.001) and 365-day mortality (HR 1.065, 95% CI 1.043-1.087, P < 0.001). A threshold effect was observed at >/=19.25 mmol/L, above which mortality risk increased markedly (28-day HR 1.336, 95% CI 1.126-1.586, P = 0.001; 365-day HR 1.429, 95% CI 1.208-1.691, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed significant differences (log-rank P < 0.0001), and ROC analysis demonstrated that ACAG provided superior discrimination compared with AG and albumin for both 28-day (AUC = 0.734) and 365-day mortality (AUC = 0.696). Associations were consistent across clinical subgroups without significant interactions. CONCLUSION: Elevated ACAG was an independent predictor of 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD and sepsis. An inflection point of approximately 19.25 mmol/L identified a clinically meaningful threshold for risk stratification. As a simple and widely accessible parameter, ACAG may facilitate threshold-based triage and individualized management in this high-risk population, though external validation in multicenter prospective cohorts is warranted."
41399492,Identification of Co-Diagnostic Genes and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Asthma and Sepsis Through Mendelian Randomization and Immune Infiltration Analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between asthma and sepsis, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study explores the co-diagnostic genes and molecular links between asthma and sepsis using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and bioinformatics methods, and further validates the findings through clinical data, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets and drugs. METHODS: Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) data from an Icelandic population were used for two-sample MR analysis. Differential expression analysis identified common genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses explored biological functions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves validated gene performance, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT. Drug targets were predicted using DrugSigDB and validated by molecular docking. Clinical data of the three groups of people were collected, and baseline analysis, ROC curve analysis, and comparison of the expression levels of CXCL8 were carried out. RESULTS: At the genetic level, 435 genes related to asthma and 1,385 genes related to sepsis were identified, with 141 common genes. Further findings showed that there were 247 differentially expressed genes in asthma and 2,878 differentially expressed genes in sepsis, and 65 common differentially expressed genes were enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. The key gene CXCL8 exhibited excellent diagnostic performance and was closely related to immune cell subsets. Based on the research results, ten potential therapeutic drugs were screened, and seven of them were verified by molecular docking. Clinical sample testing results show that CXCL8 is closely related to asthma and sepsis. CONCLUSION: CXCL8 may be a biomarker for both asthma and sepsis. Immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, and T cells may drive comorbid progression. Potential drug candidates were identified, offering new insights for future research on these diseases."
41399335,Lactate/Albumin Ratio vs. NEWS-Lactate in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury Prognosis; Comment on Le Xuan at al. Study.,2025,"A study by Le Xuan et al. suggested that the lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) may aid in predicting sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. However, overlapping receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve confidence intervals, creatinine-only acute kidney injury (AKI) definitions, and single-point biomarker assessments limit interpretation. Given its single-centre retrospective design, broader validation with dynamic biomarkers and kidney-specific comparators is needed before the LAR can be integrated into sepsis risk stratification."
41399305,Diagnostic accuracy and safety of image-guided transperineal versus transrectal prostate biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the diagnostic performance and complication profiles of transperineal biopsy (TPBx) versus transrectal biopsy (TRBx) for prostate cancer, incorporating recent randomized and large observational studies. METHODS: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched till April 2025. Studies directly comparing TPBx and TRBx were included. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2.0 for randomized trials and the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and a GRADE assessment were performed to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (n = 90,621) were included. TPBx showed higher PCa detection (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02) and csPCa detection (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.24; p = 0.001), though the certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Heterogeneity was moderate to high. TPBx also showed lower infection-related complications and comparable overall events, though procedure-related pain was slightly higher. CONCLUSION: TPBx offers improved diagnostic yield and lower infection risk compared with TRBx, with comparable safety. However, given the moderate heterogeneity and limited high-quality RCTs, further confirmatory trials are necessary. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO identifier is CRD420251035763."
41399017,Diagnostic Accuracy of Shotgun Metagenomics for Bloodstream Infections Is Influenced by Bioinformatics Workflow Selection.,2025,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a severe and often fatal condition, and a major cause of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies due to underlying conditions and anticancer therapy-induced immunodeficiency. Rapid identification of the causative pathogens is essential as BSI results in worsened prognosis, extended hospitalization, delays or dose reductions in therapy, and may progress to sepsis and septic shock if untreated. Shotgun metagenomics is a culture-independent technique capable of detecting a wide range of fungal, viral, and bacterial organisms along with their antimicrobial resistance genes. Several studies showed that shotgun metagenomics enables the diagnosis of BSI, specifically in cases where conventional methods/culture-dependent techniques fail to identify the causative pathogens. However, evaluation of the accuracy of the applied bioinformatics pipelines remains incomplete. This study aimed to compare and optimize four commonly used bioinformatics pipelines (BLAST, Kraken, Metaphlan, RTG Core) for shotgun metagenomics by assessing their accuracy in identifying pathogens in blood samples from patients with hematological malignancies and suspected BSI, with blood culture serving as the reference standard. Our work shows that the selection of bioinformatics pipelines for diagnosing BSI strongly affects the precision of the findings, and an optimized BLAST pipeline was superior to the alternatives, as it was the only method that accurately identified the causative pathogens."
41398891,Reevaluating the obesity paradox across diverse disease outcomes: A Mendelian randomization study.,2025,"The ""obesity paradox"" suggests a protective effect of obesity on certain diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, but results remain inconsistent, largely due to reliance on body mass index (BMI) alone. To clarify this, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causal effects of multiple obesity-related anthropometric traits on key clinical outcomes. We conducted MR analyses using summary statistics from genome-wide association study to investigate the causal effects of 13 obesity-related anthropometric indicators-including BMI, basal metabolic rate (BMR), hip circumference, waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BFP), arm fat mass (AFM), leg fat mass (LFM), trunk fat mass (TFM), trunk fat free mass (TFFM), whole body fat mass, whole body fat free mass (WBFFM), whole body water mass (WBWM), trunk predicted mass (TPM)-on 5 major clinical outcomes: diffuse large B cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, pathological fracture in patient with osteoporosis, sepsis, and 28-day mortality due to sepsis. We selected these outcomes because they represent distinct but obesity-relevant disease categories, encompassing cancer, metabolic-skeletal complications, infection, and mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses, included tests for heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy, were performed to assess the stability of MR results. MR analyses revealed no evidence supporting the obesity paradox but demonstrated causal associations between obesity-related traits and clinical outcomes. After excluding traits with horizontal pleiotropy, results showed: BMR, TFFM, and TPM increased diffuse large B cell lymphoma risk; BMI, BMR, AFM, LFM, TFFM, WBFFM, and TPM increased pancreatic cancer risk; BMR, TFFM, WBFFM, WBWM, and TPM increased pathological fracture risk in osteoporosis; BMI, BMR, WC, BFP, AFM, LFM, TFM, whole body fat mass and WBWM increased sepsis risk; and BMI, hip circumference, WC, BFP, AFM, LFM, and TFM increased 28-day sepsis mortality risk (all P < .05). This MR study found no evidence of an ""obesity paradox"" for the specific outcomes evaluated. Instead, our findings demonstrated that elevated levels of obesity-related anthropometric traits are causally associated with increased risks of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, pathological fractures in osteoporosis, sepsis, and sepsis-related 28-day mortality. These results provide important insights into the pathogenic role of obesity and may inform future strategies for obesity-related disease prevention and risk assessment."
41398887,Thyroid storm complicated by metabolic encephalopathy in a young patient: A case report and literature review.,2025,"RATIONALE: Metabolic encephalopathy is a rare but potentially devastating complication of thyroid storm. Its etiology is complex, clinical manifestations are diverse, there is no clear diagnostic criteria, so it is easy to lead to missed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and mistreatment. We report a case of thyroid storm complicated by metabolic encephalopathy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 20-year-old male patient with a history of hyperthyroidism was admitted to the hospital because of limb twitching, foaming at the mouth and coma. The laboratory test results confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid storm. After treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms gradually improved. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis was thyroid crisis complicated with metabolic encephalopathy, sepsis, pneumonia, acute kidney damage, liver function impairment, and rhabdomyolysis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was given 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously per 8 hours, propylthiouracil tablets of 250 mg q4h by nasal feeding, propranolol of 50 mg q4h by nasal feeding, piperacillin 5 g q8h intravenously, tigecycline 50 mg q12h (the first drug is 100 mg) intravenously, voriconazole 0.2 g q12h intravenously, and continuous kidney replacement therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient's vital signs stabilized, his consciousness level improved, and after being taken off the ventilator, he was transferred to the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where he received Chinese medicine and rehabilitation treatment, and was discharged from the hospital after his condition improved. LESSONS: Thyroid storm complicated by metabolic encephalopathy requires early diagnosis and treatment, and the neurological function damage caused by it is usually reversible."
41398794,Association between neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients: Analysis from the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"The neutrophil count-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR), a composite biomarker of lipid metabolism and inflammation, has been regarded as an indicator for predicting clinical outcomes in patients suffering from acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. However, the association between the NHR and 28-day all-cause mortality in the sepsis population remains unclear. Our study population comprised 1018 sepsis patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV V2.2) database who were grouped into tertiles based on their NHRs. In this study, curve fitting and 2-piecewise regression models were utilized to analyze the dose-response relationship between the Log NHR and 28-day mortality. The mean age of the participants in the study cohort was 65.0 +/- 15.7 years, and 56.3% were men. The 28-day mortality rates for the NHR tertiles were 15% (51), 13.3% (45), and 18.2% (62). By investigating the Log NHR and 28-day mortality, we observed a clear U-shaped relationship. Threshold saturation analysis revealed that when Log NHR below 1.87 (NHR 6.50), with each 1-unit increase in the Log NHR, the risk of 28-day mortality significantly decreased (HR = 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.37, 1.01, P = .0526). Conversely, the logNHR for 28-day mortality increased beyond 1.87 (HR = 1.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.51; P = .0045). Stratified by age, our analysis revealed nuanced variations in the Log NHR and 28-day mortality association across different age groups. This study revealed a robust U-shaped relationship between the Log NHR and 28-day all-cause mortality in the sepsis population, with a critical threshold of Log NHR = 1.87 (NHR 6.50). This risk is influenced by age."
41398565,Association between serum uric acid to albumin ratio and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The serum uric acid to albumin ratio (UAR) is a recently recognized composite inflammatory biomarker that has not received sufficient attention in relation to sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the association between UAR and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a retrospective database of sepsis patients who were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University between January 2015 and November 2023. The patients were divided into four groups based on UAR quartiles. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were used to evaluate all-cause mortality among the four groups. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic splines were performed to examine the association between UAR and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of other variables on the relationship between UAR and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1123 patients (63.0% males) were included in this study. The in-hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates were 33.9% and 31.7%, respectively. There was a significant association between higher UAR levels and an increased cumulative incidence of 30-/60-day mortality (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the UAR was independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality [per SD increase in the UAR: hazard ratio (HR) (95%CI): 1.186 (1.067-1.319); P = 0.002] and ICU mortality [per SD increase in the UAR: HR (95%CI): 1.190 (1.068-1.327); P = 0.002]. Restricted cubic spline regression analysis illustrated a linear relationship between UAR and the risks of in-hospital and ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated UAR levels were strongly associated with all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis, suggesting their potential as predictors of poor outcomes. However, further studies are needed to validate our findings and investigate the underlying causal factors that could contribute to sepsis prevention and treatment.

41398250,Early prediction of vasopressor initiation in ICU sepsis patients using an interpretable EHR-based ML model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of septic patients who will require vasopressor support could provide a critical window for hemodynamic optimisation, yet current bedside cues often appear only when shock is imminent. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and validate an interpretable electronic health record (EHR)-based machine-learning model that predicts vasopressor initiation several hours before therapy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database (2008-2019). We screened adult Sepsis-3 ICU stays and labeled the patients who commenced continuous vasopressor infusions 6 to 48 hours after admission as cases; we defined controls as sepsis patients with ICU stays >/=48 hours and no vasopressor exposure. We performed one to one nearest neighbour matching on age, sex, Charlson index, SOFA score with the cardiovascular component removed, weight, and early lactate/hematocrit availability to minimise confounding. We engineered demographic, physiological, and laboratory features measured from -6 to -2 hours relative to vasopressor initiation (or a matched time point) under multiple parameter combinations. We trained seven algorithms with Monte Carlo cross validation and evaluated performance on an independent validation set. We assessed model interpretability with Shapley values. RESULTS: We analyzed 1,539 cases and 1,431 controls; the independent validation set comprised 751 stays (~25%). A Random Forest classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.79), a sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69-0.78), a specificity of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.60-0.70), a precision of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.66-0.74) and a F1 score of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.75) at the Youden's index threshold. The model outperformed simple surrogates-mean blood pressure (AUROC, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.64-0.72) and modified shock index (AUROC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.69)-and a reproduced bidirectional LSTM (AUROC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77). Key predictors included declining mean blood pressure at - 2 to -4 hours, elevated lactate ( > 2.5 mmol/L), and hematocrit outside 30-37%. Model alerts would occur two to four hours before vasopressor initiation, providing actionable lead time for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study shows that routinely collected ICU data can predict impending vasopressor initiation with clinically interpretable outputs. However, these findings reflect internal validation only and should be interpreted with caution. External validation on multi-center retrospective cohorts, followed by silent-mode prospective evaluation, is warranted to confirm generalisability and to assess the real-world impact on time-to-vasopressor, fluid balance, and patient outcomes."
41398191,Diagnostic value of flow cytometric urine analysis in urinary tract infections of newborns and infants.,2025,"This study aimed to compare the results of flow cytometric urine analysis and urine culture for the rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections and to determine the leukocyte and bacterial cutoffs that could achieve maximum sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) during the newborn and infant periods. This cross-sectional observational study included urine samples submitted for culture from the neonatal intensive care unit and outpatient clinic between April 2019 and December 2021. The urine samples were first inoculated for culture and then analyzed for leukocyte and bacterial counts using a flow cytometric method (Sysmex UF-1000i, Kobe, Japan). Maximum sensitivity and NPV values ​​were determined by examining different bacterial and leukocyte cut-offs with Sysmex UF1000i. A total of 138 urine samples from 103 patients were included in the study. The reasons for urine examinations were prolonged hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and insufficient weight gain. Although no association was observed with leukocyte count, a bacterial cut-off of 83.4/microL was identified as the optimal threshold. Diagnostic values, including sensitivity (91.6%), specificity (88.6%), NPV (98.5%), and positive predictive value (PPV) (55%), were satisfactory. Based on current data, we suggest that the Sysmex UF-1000i is a valuable screening tool for detecting UTIs in asymptomatic newborns. Integrating this technology into clinical practice could enhance early diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving neonatal care outcomes."
41398160,Exercise-induced histone lactylation in monocyte-derived macrophages restores cardiac immune homeostasis and function in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.,2025,"An active lifestyle protects against cardiovascular diseases, yet its mechanisms in modulating the cardiac immune environment and preserving cardiac function remain unclear. Here, we identify a subpopulation of monocyte-derived cardiac macrophages, termed iNOS(+)Arg1(+) macrophages, which simultaneously express pro-inflammatory and pro-reparative genes in exercised male mice. Inhibiting either pro-inflammatory iNOS or pro-reparative Arg1 in these macrophages counters the exercise-induced cardiac function preservation. Mechanistically, exercise enhances glycolysis in monocytes, increasing lactate production and driving histone lactylation at H3K18, mediated by p300 as the relevant lactyltransferase and counterbalanced by HDAC2 as deacetylase. H3K18la accelerates the transition of cardiac macrophages to a pro-reparative state, restoring immune homeostasis and preserving cardiac function. Notably, human monocytes from physically active individuals exhibit elevated levels of Pan-Kla and H3K18la compared to those from sedentary individuals. Importantly, adoptive transfer of highly histone-lactylated monocytes restores cardiac function in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, which might translate into a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiomyopathy."
41397918,Empirical piperacillin/tazobactam vs carbapenems to treat bloodstream infections due to ESBL enterobacterales: a propensity score-matched observational study conducted in an emergency department in Northern Italy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Piperacillin/tazobactam is frequently used empirically in patients subsequently diagnosed with bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacterales, yet its effectiveness remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare piperacillin/tazobactam with carbapenems as empirical therapy for BSIs caused by ESBL-Enterobacterales. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted at Niguarda Hospital in Milan,Italy, enrolling consecutive patients with BSIs caused by ESBL-Enterobacterales treated empirically with either piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenems from January 2015 to December 2023. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Propensity Score Matching(PSM) was employed to mitigate potential confounding factors when assessing the association between empirical therapy and mortality. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the role of definitive piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenems on patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were included in the study, median age was 72[64-81], 64% were males, 66% had sepsis and 17% septic shock. Among them, 200(76%) received empirical piperacillin/tazobactam and 64(24%) received carbapenems. After PSM adjustment, baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. Patients who received empirical piperacillin/tazobactam had a higher in-hospital mortality compared to those receiving empirical carbapenems (14.3% vs 3.5%, adjusted Risk Difference: 10%;95%CI: 2-19%). No difference in in-hospital mortality was observed when comparing definitive piperacillin/tazobactam to definitive carbapenems (6% vs 9%, Risk Difference: -2.5%; 95%CI: -9.2 - 4.2). CONCLUSION: Empirical piperacillin/tazobactam may be associated with higher mortality compared tocarbapenemswhen treating patients with BSI due to ESBL-Enterobacterales. Further larger studies are needed to confirm the results andto identify specific scenarios in which piperacillin/tazobactam may be safely used."
41397764,Impact of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on mortality in ICU sepsis patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the impact of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), particularly polyvascular disease, on 30-day and 365-day mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients diagnosed with sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study was conducted using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, a publicly available critical care database from a tertiary care hospital in the US. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7895 adult ICU patients with sepsis were included between 2008 and 2022. Among them, 3314 (41.97%) had ASCVD, defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease or stroke. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 30 and 365 days following ICU admission. RESULT: ASCVD patients with a greater number of disease beds tend to be male, older, have lower body mass index, heart rates, mean blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature, compared with non-ASCVD patients. Before propensity-score matching, patients with ASCVD (3314) had significantly higher 30-day (29.21% vs 24.14%, p<0.001) and 365-day mortality (30.81% vs 25.67%, p<0.001) compared with those without ASCVD (4581). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified ASCVD as an independent predictor of 30-day (HR: 1.166, 95% CI 1.046 to 1.300, p=0.006), indicating a 16.6% higher risk of death within 30 days. For 365-day mortality, ASCVD patients had an HR of 1.168 (95% CI 1.051 to 1.298, p=0.004), reflecting a 16.8% increased risk of death within a year. Mortality risk increased incrementally with the number of involved vascular beds, especially in patients with three disease beds who exhibited the highest risk. Our findings reveal that in sepsis patients with ASCVD as a continuous variable, each additional bed increased the 30-day and 365-day mortality risk by 13.1% and 13.9%. ASCVD significantly increases the mortality risk in ICU patients with sepsis. CONCLUSION: Integrated management of sepsis and ASCVD-using targeted interventions such as tailored pharmacotherapy and risk factor modification-may reduce mortality and morbidity in this high-risk population."
41397619,Trends in Adolescent and Young Adult Hospitalization for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.,2025,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common reason for hospitalization among female adolescents and young adults (AYA). This study's objective was to compare inpatient characteristics, outcomes, and trends between AYAs and adults hospitalized with PID in the United States. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used National Inpatient Sample data from 2016 to 2021 to identify patients with a PID diagnosis, stratified into AYA (ages 12-21) and adult (ages 22-50) cohorts. Demographics, comorbidities, complications, length of stay, costs, and discharge disposition were analyzed using t-tests for continuous variables and Chi square tests for categorical variables. RESULTS: Among 287,365 PID hospitalizations, 9.5% (n = 27,280) occurred in AYAs, rising from 8.3% to 10.3% over the study period. AYAs were more likely than adults to be Black (31.3% vs 26.9%), Hispanic (19.8% vs 17.3%), insured by Medicaid (54.3% vs 31.8%), and live in the Northeast (17.1% vs 15.8%) and Midwest (22.3% vs 19.6%) (all P < .001). Despite having fewer comorbidities, AYAs had significantly higher rates of serious complications like sepsis (11.8% vs 10.4%, P = .001). AYAs also had shorter hospitalizations (3.7 vs 3.9 days, P = .016), lower costs ($42,994 vs $55,238, P < .001), and more routine discharges (93.5% vs 90.5%, P < 001). CONCLUSIONS: AYAs hospitalized with PID experienced more severe disease, suggesting delayed diagnosis and treatment. Stable AYA admissions, despite a declining rate in adults, may reflect barriers to care and disruptions in reproductive healthcare services-particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved screening, early intervention, and adolescent-centered sexual health services are needed to reduce disease severity and unnecessary hospitalizations."
41396226,"Urine Culture in Endourology - Clinical Relevance, Strengths and Controversies.",2025,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates the role of urine culture (UC) in preoperative assessment for endourological stone procedures. It addresses the optimal timing of UC, its predictive value compared to urinalysis, the interpretation of mixed flora, and the utility of repeat cultures after antibiotic treatment. In addition, it explores emerging molecular methods that may refine perioperative infection risk assessment. RECENT FINDINGS: UC remains the gold standard for identifying infection risk, but several controversies persist. Studies suggest urine dipstick testing can complement or even outperform UC in certain contexts, while mixed flora results often do not justify antibiotic therapy. Evidence indicates that prolonged preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduces postoperative sepsis in high-risk patients, though repeat UC after treatment has limited predictive value. Novel approaches such as next-generation sequencing and molecular diagnostics offer higher sensitivity but risk overdiagnosis. Preoperative UC remains indispensable for risk assessment in endourology, though its limitations demand a more nuanced, risk-adapted approach. Integration of urinalysis, selective repeat testing, and emerging molecular diagnostics could refine perioperative decision-making while supporting antimicrobial stewardship."
41395980,"Artificial Intelligence in Anaesthesiology: Current Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions.",2025,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming anaesthesiology through advances in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. AI-driven tools now contribute to nearly every phase of perioperative care, including preoperative risk stratification, intraoperative monitoring, imaging interpretation, airway assessment, regional anaesthesia, and critical care. Applications such as automated American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, prediction of postoperative complications and intensive care unit needs, electroencephalography-based depth-of-anaesthesia estimation, and proactive haemodynamic management are reshaping clinical decision-making. AI-augmented echocardiography enhances chamber recognition and functional measurements, whereas computer vision systems support airway evaluation and ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia by providing real-time anatomical identification and facilitating training. In critical care, AI models facilitate the early detection of sepsis, organ dysfunction, and haemodynamic instability, while improving workflow efficiency and resource allocation. AI is increasingly used in academic writing, data processing, and medical education, offering opportunities for personalised learning and simulation but raising concerns about accuracy and hallucinations. In this review, we aimed to summarise the current applications of AI in anaesthesiology, highlight the methodological, ethical, and practical challenges that limit its integration, and discuss future directions for its safe and effective adoption in perioperative care."
41395792,Identifying the cause of serious viral infections in febrile young infants visiting the pediatric emergency department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Serious viral infections (SVIs) are a frequent and worrisome cause of fever in infants aged <90 days. The present study aimed to clarify the distinction between SVIs, viremia, and respiratory infections. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data derived from a pre-COVID-19 registry of infants aged <90 days presenting with a fever to the emergency department at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Japan. Data on the patient characteristics, vital signs, clinical symptoms, physical examinations, and laboratory examinations were collected. Patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria or having a serious infection were stratified into a viremia group or respiratory infection group for univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among young infants aged <90 days presenting with febrile episodes (n = 321), 48 had a SVI. Of these, 28 and 20 were categorized into the viremia and respiratory infection groups, respectively. The mean age and body weight of the former group were significantly lower than those of the latter group (29.6 days vs. 54.6 days; 4007.1 g vs. 4976.8 g). The respiratory rate was higher in the viremia group (41.4/min vs. 35.3/min), whereas upper respiratory tract symptoms were more common in the respiratory infection group (3.6% vs. 60.0%). Laboratory examinations found a significant difference in the white blood cell count (7700/muL vs. 10,200/muL). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that viremia was associated with younger age and a higher respiratory rate than respiratory infections. Multicentric studies are needed to verify these preliminary findings."
41395786,A survey of antimicrobial therapy for culture-negative sepsis in pediatric congenital heart disease patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric sepsis, the source of infection remains unidentified in approximately 16% of cases, and causative microorganisms are not isolated in 35% of cases, potentially due to non-infectious etiologies or false-negative culture results. Although a 7- to 10-day antimicrobial regimen is commonly used for culture-negative sepsis (CNS), robust evidence supporting this practice is limited. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included congenital heart disease patients aged <5 years who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit between April 2022 and March 2024, diagnosed with sepsis, and those who exhibited negative culture results, but received antimicrobial therapy for at least 7 days. Descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted on antimicrobial use in the CNS and instances of antimicrobial re-administration within 1 month. RESULTS: Sixteen cases were analyzed, with a median age of 1 month. Eleven patients (69%) had received prior antimicrobial therapy within 1 week, primarily for surgical prophylaxis. All blood cultures yielded negative results. Bacterial growth was identified in one urine culture and two sputum cultures; however, these were asymptomatic carriers. The most frequently administered empirical regimens were cefepime combined with vancomycin. Antimicrobial re-administration occurred in five cases (31%), with a median duration of 8 days, and were primarily attributed to device-related infections; however, one case was later diagnosed as mediastinitis. Four patients (25%) died within 1 month, with mortality attributed to underlying conditions, but not to infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: A 7-day course of antimicrobials may be sufficient in CNS; however, vigilant monitoring for deep-seated infections is advised."
41394771,"Identification of Aging-Related Hub Genes (ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160) as Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Sepsis.",2025,"Sepsis arises from a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to multiorgan inflammatory injury. Early diagnosis and treatment necessitate the identification of reliable immune biomarkers. This study investigated the relationship between aging, immunity, and sepsis by analyzing six human aging-related gene sets (656 genes). We identified 16 aging-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in sepsis. Among these, ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160 demonstrated the strongest connectivity with other genes and exhibited significant predictive power. Functional enrichment analysis (GO and KEGG) revealed distinct signaling pathway profiles between high-risk and low-risk sepsis groups (stratified based on risk scores). These dysregulated pathways, associated with multiple immune cells, were primarily linked to transcriptional dysregulation in cellular processes and cancer-related pathways. Experimental validation assays corroborated the roles of ATP11B and RBBP7. Collectively, our bioinformatic and experimental findings indicate that ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160 are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis. But their potential for sepsis biomarkers still requires further verification."
41394513,Epidemiology and Outcomes of Pediatric Fever in a Rural District of Southern Mozambique: 17 Years of Morbidity Surveillance.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric febrile illnesses remain a leading cause of health care visits, morbidity, and mortality in low-resource settings. Their etiological diagnosis and outcome evaluation are challenging as available tools are limited. Herein, we describe the epidemiology, trends, and clinical outcomes of febrile pediatric outpatient clinic visits and inpatients during a 17-year-long period in Southern Mozambique. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed surveillance morbidity and demographic data from children <15 years old presenting with fever (>/=37.5 degrees C) at Manhica District Hospital and 5 peripheral health posts from 2004 to 2020. We characterized diagnoses and clinical signs, stratified by outpatient clinic visits and hospitalizations, and calculated 7-day mortality odds, case fatality ratios (CFRs), and minimum community-based incidence rates. RESULTS: A total of 664 223 outpatient visits and 23 166 hospitalizations were included. The median age (interquartile range) was 47.1 (20.0-92.3) months for outpatients and 21.2 (10.1-41.5) months for inpatients. The most frequent first encounter diagnoses included malaria (33.5%), upper (27.8%) and lower (10.1%) respiratory tract infections, and acute gastrointestinal infection (6.0%), whose frequencies showed a marked annual decline from 2004 to 2020, particularly among inpatients. All-cause 7-day mortality was 0.1% and 2.2% among outpatients and inpatients, respectively. Sepsis and meningitis were less common but presented the highest CFRs (9%-16%). Malnutrition and HIV infection were major contributors to inpatient mortality. Seizures, edema, dehydration, and reduced consciousness were strong predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria, respiratory tract, and acute gastrointestinal infections represented the predominant causes of fever and mortality, with decreasing trends over time. This analysis underscores the value of epidemiological surveillance and the need for improved early diagnosis and clinical management tools for febrile children."
41394420,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: a potential supportive marker for elderly community-acquired bloodstream infections-a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Exploring the value of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a potential supportive marker in community-acquired bloodstream infection in elderly patients. METHODS: By reviewing the data of inpatients in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University from January 2012 to December 2021, a total of 58 elderly patients with community-acquired bloodstream infection and 174 inpatients without infection during the same period, matched for age, sex, and concomitant diseases, were included. Clinical data were collected and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, and concomitant diseases between the infected and non-infected groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that only increased NLR among leukocyte indexes was a risk factor for bloodstream infections. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of increased NLR to support the diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infections in the elderly were 0.72, 0.99, and 0.95; the optimal cut-off value is 8.0. CONCLUSION: The increase in NLR was superior to the rise of traditional white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Thus, NLR can be used as an indication for the early diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infection in the elderly. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for supporting the diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infections in elderly patients was determined to be 8.0. When NLR exceeds this threshold (> 8.0), it serves as a clinical alert for community physicians, indicating a significantly elevated probability of elderly patients developing community-acquired bloodstream infections."
41394406,Exploring the interchangeable roles of fibrinogen and FIBTEM in patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: FIBTEM, a rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) component, assesses fibrin-based clot firmness and indirectly measures fibrinogen function. It offers faster turnaround time compared to the Clauss method for fibrinogen quantification, which may support early coagulation assessment in critically ill patients with sepsis. OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to evaluate the correlation between FIBTEM parameters and fibrinogen levels and predict the possibility of hyperfibrinogenemia using FIBTEM parameters in patients with sepsis. DESIGN: A retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective observational study. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis were recruited and admitted to the University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City intensive care unit from June 2020 to December 2021. The international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, and FIBTEM parameters (A5, A10, A20, and maximum clot firmness (MCF)) were assessed for each patient. The correlations among laboratory parameters were assessed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Predicted values of fibrinogen and FIBTEM were analyzed using simple linear regression, Bland-Altman plots, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Kappa coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: The median age of 159 patients with sepsis was 69. Males represented 51.6% of the participants. The percentage of patients with comorbidities was 88.1%. The mean plasma fibrinogen level was 5.4 +/- 1.8 g/L. Fibrinogen levels were strongly correlated with FIBTEM parameters (p < 0.01 for all values), including A5 (r = 0.701), A10 (r = 0.717), A20 (r = 0.723), and MCF (r = 0.735). MCF could not predict exact fibrinogen levels (CCC = 0.703). The AUC of the MCF to predict hyperfibrinogenemia was 0.905 (95% CI: 0.866-0.945), with a sensitivity of 85.5%, a specificity of 83.1%, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.69 at the optimal cut-off value of 22.5 mm. CONCLUSION: FIBTEM MCF could be a practical, rapid, surrogate tool for detecting hyperfibrinogenemia in sepsis and may help guide early clinical decisions before fibrinogen test results are available, although further validation in larger studies is required."
41394364,The predictive value of respiration parameters and the Glasgow Goma score for mortality of sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: Insights from the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) frequently complicates sepsis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to identify factors that predict short-term (30-day) and long-term (one-year) mortality in ARDS patients and to develop robust predictive models. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study, conducted from August 2024 to October 2024 in XinHua Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, used data from the MIMIC database-specifically MIMIC IV 2.2-to identify sepsis patients who were diagnosed with ARDS within 24 hours of ICU admission. Univariate logistic regression was used to explore associations between respiratory parameters and the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score (low group </= 12). Mortality at 30 days and one-year post-ICU admission was used as outcome measures. The dataset was balanced via synthetic minority over-sampling technique and split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Variable selection was performed via the best subset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest, and boruta methods. Predictive models were developed and validated via calibration and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: The cohort included 3,158 patients (58% female). Significant differences in PaCO(2) levels were detected between 30-day survivors and non-survivors (p>0.05), but not detected at one year (p>0.05). More patients with low GCS scores died within one year (20.9%) than survivors (17.1%; p=0.01), but no such association was found for 30-day mortality (p>0.05). The predictive models perform well for predicating short-term and long-term mortality and had AUCs of 0.820 and 0.790, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GCS scores were significantly associated with one-year mortality but not with 30-day mortality or with respiratory-related parameters. The developed predictive models demonstrated good performance. These findings aid in the treatment of ARDS patients with sepsis."
41394358,"Prescribing patterns of antibiotics according to the WHO access, watch, and reserve (AWaRe) classification in the pediatric outpatient department: A prospective study.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, disproportionately affecting young children, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification system to guide responsible antibiotic prescribing. This study evaluates antibiotic prescribing patterns in pediatric outpatient departments in Pakistan using the WHO AWaRe framework. METHODOLOGY: A prospective, cross-sectional, multicentric study was conducted in four urban Level two teaching hospitals affiliated with Aga Khan University Hospital in Pakistan. Data was collected monthly for one year (August, 2023 - July, 2024), involving pediatric patients aged one month to twelve years. Prescriptions were categorized into AWaRe groups, with frequencies analyzed by clinical indication and patient age. RESULTS: Of 1,802 pediatric encounters analyzed, antibiotics were prescribed in 529 cases (29.4%), predominantly orally (77.9%). Azithromycin (19.5%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid (19.1%) were the most commonly prescribed agents. Watch antibiotics represented 69.2% of prescriptions, significantly exceeding WHO recommendations (</=40%). Antibiotic prescription rates varied substantially by diagnosis, being highest for enteric fever (89.6%), sepsis (82.4%), and UTIs (75.0%), with notable inappropriate prescribing for viral conditions such as URTIs (33.2%), acute febrile illness (31.7%), and bronchiolitis (31%). Narrow-spectrum Access antibiotics were underutilized (29.7%), while Reserve antibiotics were rarely prescribed (1.1%). CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the poor implementation of AWaRe among pediatricians in Pakistan indicates urgent need for multiple interventions. There is a dire need to improve antibiotic prescribing practices, ranging from antibiotic prescription policies, training of pediatricians in antibiotic use, AWaRe implementation, and regular monitoring in the form of clinical audits."
41393754,Sepsis Bundle Compliance Before and After the Implementation of a Protocolized Sepsis Program.,2025,"Introduction Protocolized approaches to sepsis management, or ""sepsis bundles,"" have been increasingly adopted by medical institutions to facilitate prompt treatment and improve outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a protocolized sepsis algorithm to improve Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) hour-3 bundle compliance. Methods This retrospective, single-center study included patients aged>/= 18 years admitted for severe sepsis or septic shock who received at least one dose of antibiotics within 24 hours of admission, either Pre-Code Sepsis (PC) between 3/15/22 and 6/15/22, or After-Code Sepsis implementation (AC) between 3/15/23 and 6/15/23. The Code Sepsis program consists of a team-based algorithm of sepsis bundle components, including but not limited to clinical assessments, fluids, antibiotics, and laboratory studies, to enhance their timely completion in the emergency department. The primary outcome evaluated hour-3 bundle compliance. Secondary outcomes included hour-1 and hour-6 bundle compliance. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics v.29.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 118 patients were included in the study (59 PC vs. 59 AC). The mean patient age was 63 +/-18 years; 45% were male, and 42% were diagnosed with septic shock. Hour-3 bundle compliance trended toward improvement (25% PC vs. 41% AC, p=0.07) and similarly observed for the hour-6 bundle (51% PC vs. 64% AC, p=0.13). Hour-1 bundle compliance significantly improved (10% PC vs. 24% AC, p=0.03). Hospital length of stay was significantly shorter after Code Sepsis (eight (0.7-50) days PC vs. five (0.4-34) days AC, p=0.005). No difference between in-hospital all-cause mortality (20% PC vs. 10% AC, p=0.13) or hospice disposition (8% PC vs. 2% AC, p=0.20) was observed. Conclusions Code Sepsis implementation was associated with a trend toward improved hour-3 and hour-6 bundle compliance, significantly improved hour-1 bundle compliance, and reduced hospital length of stay. Further prospective studies of protocolized approaches to sepsis management are required to determine the impact on mortality."
41393148,Intestinal dysbiosis in critically ill patients: a case-control study of Enterobacteriaceae enrichment and reduced microbial diversity.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Critical illness disrupts gut microbiota homeostasis, potentially exacerbating systemic inflammation and adverse outcomes. This study investigates gut dysbiosis patterns in ICU patients, with a focus on Enterobacteriaceae enrichment and microbial diversity loss, to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this case-control study, 37 ICU patients (sepsis: n = 17; non-sepsis: n = 20) and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Fecal samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 regions). Microbial diversity (Shannon/Simpson indices), <mark>beta diversity (Bray-Curtis PCoA)</mark>, and taxonomic differences (LEfSe, LDA > 2.5) were analyzed using QIIME2 and R. RESULTS: Critically ill patients showed reduced alpha diversity vs. controls (Shannon p = 0.04; Simpson p = 0.04). Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) were significantly enriched in ICU patients (LDA = 4.2, p < 0.01), while Ruminococcus dominated controls. Beta diversity differed markedly (PERMANOVA R (2) = 0.199, p = 0.001). No diversity differences were observed between sepsis/non-sepsis subgroups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ICU patients exhibit gut dysbiosis characterized by Enterobacteriaceae expansion and diversity loss, independent of sepsis status. These findings underscore the gut microbiome's role in critical illness and support exploring microbiota-targeted interventions (e.g., selective probiotics) to improve outcomes."
41392952,Harmless parasites? Infections with Hemolivia mauritanica (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina: Karyolysidae) and Haemocystidium spp. (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida: Haemoproteidae) have a negligible impact on white cell counts in tortoise hosts.,2025,"The pathogenicity of haemogregarines and their effects on the health status of ectothermic hosts remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the impact of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904) infection on the differential leukocyte count (DLC) as a measurable indicator of health in tortoise hosts. A total of 206 blood smears were analysed, including 181 from spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca Linnaeus) and 25 from marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata Schoepff). Light microscopy was used to identify infected individuals, determine DLC, and quantify parasitaemia levels. Overall, H. mauritanica was detected in 125 of 181 (69%) T. graeca samples and 21 of 25 (84%) T. marginata samples. To assess whether infection influenced DLC, we statistically compared leukocyte profiles between infected and uninfected individuals. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of other factors, including host species, parasitaemia intensity, sex, age, and the month and year of blood collection. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests revealed that parasitaemia and age had a statistically significant effect on DLC in T. graeca. Further analysis using linear models showed a significant association between parasitaemia and DLC, specifically affecting azurophils in T. graeca and basophils in T. marginata. Nine T. graeca tortoises positive for H. mauritanica were co-infected with haemosporidian parasites of the genus Haemocystidium Castellani et Willey, 1904, specifically three with Haemocystidium anatolicum (Orkun et Guven, 2013) and six with Haemocystidium caucasicum (Krasilnikov, 1965). Although co-infection itself was not statistically significant, a separate analysis of Haemocystidium parasitaemia revealed a significant effect on lymphocyte DLC. Furthermore, the frequent presence of mitotic and polychromatophilous erythrocytes in H. mauritanica-infected tortoises suggests a potential increase in erythrocyte regeneration."
41391701,Long-term immune and epigenetic dysregulation following COVID-19.,2026,"Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is heterogeneous in phenotype and functional state. This prospective, observational study studied adults six months after acute COVID-19. We defined clinical phenotypes and profiled plasma mediators grouped into functional pathways (IL-1, IL-17, IFNgamma/IFNgamma-related cytokines, pro-/anti-inflammatory clusters). A subset underwent RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. Three cohorts were analyzed (Exploratory n = 46; Discovery n = 591; Validation Cohort n = 289). PACS compatible symptoms were identified in 69.6 %; 59.2 % and 54.7 % respectively. Five phenotypes emerged. IL-1 cytokines (OR: 3.17, 95 % CIs: 1.94-5.19, p: 4.5 x 10(-6)), IL-17 cytokines (OR: 2.45, 95 % CIs: 1.47-4.07 p: 5.88 x 10(-4)) and the anti-inflammatory biomarkers (OR: 2.15, 95 % CIs: 1.34-3.45, p: 1.5 x 10(-3)) were upregulated in PACS patients. Respiratory phenotype was correlated with IL-1 upregulation (OR 4.23; 95 % CIs, 1.69-10.8, p = 0.0025). Transcriptomic and epigenomic changes were observed. Distinct phenotypes of PACS are driven by different immunological mechanisms at the DNA, transcriptomic, and protein levels."
41391567,A critical role for MALAT1 in gram-negative bacteria-induced coagulation via regulation of caspase-11 signaling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Our previous animal studies suggested the critical role of the type I interferon (IFNbeta) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) axis in coagulation; however, the predictive value of IFNbeta/HMGB1 for the clinical onset of septic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to further elaborate on the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated DIC and identify potential biomarkers suitable for the early prediction of DIC. METHODS: IFNbeta/HMGB1 plasma levels were measured in septic patients without DIC at admission. The onset of septic DIC was assessed 48 hours thereafter. We subsequently compared the leukocyte transcriptomes of patients with and without DIC. A series of genetically modified mice, including IFNalpha/betaR1(-/-), Tlr4(-/-), Malat1(-/-), Casp1(-/-), and Casp11(-/-) mice, as well as Malat1(flox/flox) or Gpx4(flox/flox) in combination with Cdh5-, Alb-, Vav- and Lyz2-Cre mice, were used to investigate the mechanisms. RESULTS: The plasma level of IFNbeta but not HMGB1 in septic patients showed a consistent correlation with the onset of DIC. We identified an HMGB1-bypassing signaling pathway in which IFNbeta stimulates macrophages to express high levels of the long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in response to gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of Malat1 specifically in macrophages restored glutathione exhaustion and enhanced glutathione peroxidase 4 activity by maintaining Yin-Yang 1-mediated Hba-a1 expression, which dampens lipopolysaccharide internalization and caspase-11 activation, and suppressed caspase-11/GSDMD-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure, thereby protecting against bacteria-induced coagulation. CONCLUSION: Our study unveils a novel immunocoagulation pathway in which MALAT1 fuels caspase-11-dependent coagulation by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 activity, which provides new insights into the coagulation mechanisms in bacterial sepsis."
41391329,A visual-colorimetric-photothermal multimodal immunoassay for sensitive and quantitative detection of Escherichia coli.,2026,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the most common bacterial pathogens encountered in hospital settings, frequently associated with postoperative infections, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. Rapid and accurate detection of E. coli in clinical samples is critical for early diagnosis, timely treatment, and reducing complications, especially in settings where laboratory infrastructure is limited. To address this need, we developed a multimodal lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform that integrates visual, colorimetric, and photothermal readouts for E. coli detection. The assay uses AuPd@Ab1 nanoprobes prepared by conjugating AuPd nanozymes with E. coli-specific antibodies (Ab1). In a sandwich LFIA, the probes accumulate at the test line for visual identification (10(3) CFU/mL). Their peroxidase-like activity enables colorimetric quantification via TMB oxidation, with a limit of detection of 20 CFU/mL. Moreover, under 808 nm laser excitation, the AuPd nanozymes produce measurable heat signals that correlate linearly with bacteria population, achieving a photothermal LOD as low as 5 CFU/mL. Validation using clinical samples confirmed the assay's reliability and sensitivity. By integrating multiple readout modes into a simple lateral flow format, this platform improves detection accuracy and offers practical advantages for rapid, bedside E. coli screening. Its multimodal design and low detection thresholds make it a promising tool for early infection control in clinical diagnostics, particularly in resource-limited or emergency care settings."
41391076,Comparative Assessment of Cardiac Biomarkers and APACHE II Score for Prognostication in Septicemic Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiac dysfunction is one of the major causes of mortality in patients with sepsis. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), and other prognostic scores for sepsis have established data regarding their accuracy in predicting mortality. We have assessed the prognostic role of cardiac biomarkers [creatine phosphokinase-myocardial band (CPK-MB), troponin I (Trop I), and probrain natriuretic peptide (proBNP)] in patients with sepsis and compared it with the APACHE II score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 patients (63 in each group) participated in this case-control study in a large tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients with sepsis who required hospitalization were enrolled in the case group and compared with another group of nonsepticemic patients. They were taken for detailed evaluation and investigation on day 1 and day 3. Our study included proBNP, CPK-MB, Trop I, and APACHE II score. RESULTS: Both the case and control groups comprised 63 patients each. It was observed that the cardiac biomarkers (proBNP, Trop I, CPK-MB) were markedly higher among cases than in controls. Similarly, these markers were also found markedly higher in fatal cases than survivors in the case group. Out of all three biomarkers, proBNP was correlated well with mortality as much as the APACHE II score. It was also observed that increasing trends in the levels of biomarkers depict prognosis more effectively than a single value. CONCLUSION: We conclude that cardiac biomarkers can be routinely used as dynamic markers for the prediction of mortality and prognosis in patients with sepsis. ProBNP may be useful in predicting mortality in patients with sepsis."
41390846,Racial disparities in in-hospital outcomes and costs among U.S. patients on peritoneal dialysis: a 15-year national cohort study.,2025,"Racial disparities in in-hospital treatment and outcomes among end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) are not well-characterized. This study aims to assess racial differences in treatment, complications, and resource utilization among hospitalized ESKD patients undergoing PD. This study was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample to identify hospitalization of ESKD patients receiving PD from the year 2003 to 2018. The racial difference in in-hospital treatment and outcomes was analyzed using logistic regression and in resource utilization using linear regression. White race was used as the reference group for outcome comparison. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, year of hospitalization, Charlson comorbidity score, comorbidities, smoking, alcohol use, primary insurance, hospital type, size, and ownership. Among 82,704 hospitalizations of ESKD patients receiving PD, 44,552 (53.9%) were White, 23,608 (28.5%) were Black, 11,020 (13.3%) were Hispanic, and 3,524 (4.3%) were Asian and Pacific Islander. Black race was associated with higher odds for receiving PD catheter adjustment/removal, PD peritonitis, PD mechanical complications, volume overload but lower odds for receiving palliative care service, sepsis and in-hospital mortality, compared with White race. Hispanic race was associated with higher odds for receiving PD catheter adjustment/removal, blood transfusion, PD peritonitis, PD mechanical complications, volume overload, sepsis but lower odds for receiving palliative care service, metabolic acidosis, compared with White race. Asian/Pacific Islander race was associated with higher odds for receiving mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, PD mechanical complications, sepsis but lower odds for hyperkalemia, compared with White race. Black race had lower, while Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander race had higher hospitalization cost, compared with White race. Hospitalizations of Black patients experienced more PD complications but lower mortality and costs, while hospitalizations of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander patients faced higher complications and hospitalization costs. These findings underscore the need for equity-driven policies that promote culturally responsive, cost-effective, and complication-aware inpatient management strategies for PD patients."
41390809,Enhancing prognostic accuracy in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: a machine learning approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIMD) is a severe yet potentially reversible complication of sepsis, characterized by myocardial dysfunction and associated with high short-term mortality. Conventional scoring systems and traditional statistical models inadequately capture the complex pathophysiology of SIMD, highlighting the need for robust prognostic tools. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1068 adult SIMD patients from the MIMIC-IV database, of whom 236 (22.1%) died within 28 days of ICU discharge. Candidate predictors were screened using Boruta, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV). Eight machine learning algorithms were developed and compared. Model performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, confusion matrices, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics. Model interpretability was assessed with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: Seven independent predictors were identified: Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), cerebrovascular disease, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). Logistic regression achieved consistent discrimination, with AUC values of 0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.82) in the training set, 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) in the validation set, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.94) in the test set. Model accuracies were 70.0%, 67.0%, and 79.0%, respectively, with sensitivities ranging from 0.76-0.82 and specificities from 0.65-0.79. Negative predictive values (NPV) remained high (0.91-0.93), while positive predictive values (PPV) were moderate (0.38-0.52). The K-S statistic indicated strong discrimination (0.46, 0.45, and 0.52 across cohorts). SHAP analysis confirmed APS III ( approximately 0.11), age ( approximately 0.05), and ALP ( approximately 0.03) as the most influential predictors, with CCI ( approximately 0.02) and CK-MB ( approximately 0.01) contributing modest but clinically relevant effects. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a parsimonious logistic regression model with robust discrimination (AUC up to 0.88) and calibration (K-S > 0.45). The model underscores acute illness severity, aging, and hepatic dysfunction as principal determinants of short-term mortality in SIMD, offering valuable support for early risk stratification in critical care."
41390617,Effects of inactivated COVID-19 vaccination on HIV viremia and reservoir size: a longitudinal cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is regarded as the most effective and cost-efficient mean of managing COVID-19. Whether receiving inactivated vaccine leads to plasma viral load (pVL) rebound and affects HIV reservoirs size has been a major concern for people living with HIV (PLWH). In this study we performed a longitudinal observational study to explore the dynamic changes of pVL and HIV-1 total DNA with PLWH after vaccination with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Information and venous blood samples from PLWH were collected prevaccination (BC1), three weeks after the first vaccination (BC2), four weeks after the second dose (BC3), six months after the second dose (BC4), and two weeks after the third dose (BC5) to test RBD-specific IgG antibody, plasma viral load (pVL), HIV-1 total DNA and CD4+ T cell count. RESULTS: A total of 25 PLWH participated in this study, with a median age of 34 (IQR 28.5 - 40.0) years. No significant difference in proportion of undetectable pVL group, pVL >/= 20 cp/ml group and pVL < 20 cp/ml group was observed among five time points (p = 0.506). Significant difference was observed in total HIV-1 DNA copies among different time points in both group of CD4+ T cells </= 300 and > 300. In the group of nadir CD4+ T cells > 300, pairwise comparison of five sets of data showed that total HIV-1 DNA copies at BC5 was significantly lower than BC1 (P = 0.043) and BC3 (P = 0.008). And duration of HIV infection was positively correlated with HIV-1 DNA copies at BC4 (R = 0.729, p = 0.007) and BC5 (R = 0.690, p = 0.013), S/CO value of RBD-specific-IgG at BC3 were negatively correlated with HIV-1 total DNA copies at time points of BC2 (R=-0.713, p = 0.009) and BC3 (R=-0.587, p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccine didn't significantly affect pVL. HIV-1 total DNA copies had a downward trend after vaccination. Duration of infection and IgG titer might be correlated with HIV-1 total DNA copies after vaccination."
41390503,Association between serum sodium and the risk of sepsis-related liver injury: a cross-sectional study based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-related liver injury (SRLI) is a common complication of sepsis, yet its mechanisms are unclear and the association between serum sodium (SNa) and SRLI has been rarely investigated. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized data from the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients diagnosed with sepsis. The primary outcome was SRLI. SNa levels were categorized into hyponatremia, normonatremia, and hypernatremia groups based on clinical cutoffs for statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between SNa and SRLI, and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was applied to verify potential nonlinear associations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the results, and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among 11,809 adult patients with sepsis (57.2% male; mean age 65.8 +/- 17.1 years), the prevalence of SRLI was 42.5%. Multivariable binary logistic regression showed that SNa was inversely associated with SRLI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-0.99; P < 0.05). GAM analysis indicated a nonlinear association with a saturation effect between SNa and SRLI, with a threshold at 135 mmol/L. At SNa </= 135 mmol/L, SNa was inversely associated with SRLI, whereas the association was not statistically significant at SNa > 135 mmol/L. Subgroup analyses were generally consistent, with a stronger inverse association observed among patients with cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: In critically ill adults with sepsis, SNa showed a nonlinear inverse association with SRLI, with a threshold around 135 mmol/L. Incorporating sodium into clinical assessment and stratification may be informative; multicenter prospective cohorts are warranted to confirm clinical utility."
41390378,"Incidence and risk factors of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in sepsis survivors: a prospective, observational study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) encompasses new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, or mental health that manifest and persist after critical illness, yet the burden of PICS in this population remains under-characterized. We sought to quantify the incidence of PICS in sepsis survivors and to identify its independent predictors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of adult sepsis patients discharged from the medical ICU of Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, between October 2024 and February 2025. Comprehensive baseline data-including demographics, clinical characteristics, and ICU interventions-were collected. Standardized telephone and in-person assessments were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge to diagnose PICS across physical, cognitive, and mental health domains. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with incident PICS. RESULTS: Of 238 eligible patients, 150 met all inclusion criteria and completed follow-up assessment. The incidence of PICS was 72% at 1 month, 68% at 3 months, and 44% at 6 months. Multi-domain impairment (>/= 2 domains) was present in 38%, 34%, and 20% of survivors at the same timepoints, respectively; concurrent impairment in all three domains declined from 10.7% to 0.7%. After adjustment, higher APACHE II scores (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.27-1.94, P < 0.001) and elevated peak blood glucose (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.54-3.23, P < 0.001) independently predicted PICS, whereas higher education level (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.82, P < 0.001) conferred protection. CONCLUSIONS: PICS is common among sepsis survivors, with incidence declining but remaining substantial up to 6 months after ICU discharge. APACHE II scores and glycaemic control are robust, modifiable predictors, while educational attainment appears protective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2400094977 (Date: 31/12/2024)."
41389570,Endocarditis risk stratification with scores: what about reproducibility? The case of NOVA and DENOVA scores for Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: NOVA and DENOVA scores were developed to guide endocarditis risk assessment in Enterococcus faecalis Bacteremia (EfB), but some of their criteria may be open to interpretation. We aimed to evaluate their inter-rater reliability and feasibility. METHODS: Thirty-two physicians from four specialties involved in the management of endocarditis independently evaluated eight EfB patient records using the NOVA and DENOVA scores. Each score was applied eight times per case. Inter-rater reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha, and agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Completion time was also recorded. RESULTS: No record received identical scores from all raters. NOVA showed low inter-rater reliability (alpha = 0.37), while DENOVA reached moderate levels (alpha = 0.49). High agreement was found for extreme score values, but agreement dropped markedly for intermediate values. Among score items, Auscultation of murmur (A) and Valve disease (V) had the highest reliability (alpha > 0.8), while Duration of symptoms (D) and Origin of infection (O) had the lowest (alpha < 0.2). Completion times were similar between NOVA and DENOVA but varied by specialty. CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of these scores is limited, especially near critical thresholds, highlighting the need to complement scoring tools with clinical judgment in EfB."
41389427,Development and multicenter validation of a machine learning model for postoperative sepsis risk in critically Ill traumatic spinal injury patients.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning model for postoperative sepsis in critically ill traumatic spinal injury (TSI) patients, a frequent and severe complication without dedicated predictive tools. METHODS: Model development used the MIMIC-IV 3.1 database, with external validation in the eICU-CRD 2.0 database and a Chinese TSI cohort. Variables documented within 24 h of postoperative ICU admission were screened using univariable testing and refined through Boruta and Group-Lasso regression to identify the final predictors. Thirteen base learners were trained and combined in a stacking ensemble optimized by fivefold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC), average precision from precision-recall (PR-AP), calibration, decision, and lift curves, along with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 scores. Interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis. RESULTS: The development cohort comprised 808 patients, with 461 (57.1 %) sepsis cases, and the external validation cohort consisted of 358 patients, with 86 (24.0 %) events. Twelve predictors entered modeling, with the stacking model achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.918 and PR-AP of 0.938 in training and 0.889 and 0.936 in validation, maintaining close calibration, superior clinical utility confirmed by decision and lift curves, and balanced classification metrics, while most first-level models deteriorated markedly. External validation confirmed consistent performance and effective high-risk stratification. SHAP analysis underscored surgical burden, severity, hemodynamic, renal, and coagulation domains as key contributors, ensuring interpretability at cohort and individual levels. CONCLUSION: This first validated model for postoperative sepsis in critically ill TSI patients shows relatively robust performance and interpretability, enabling early risk stratification and supporting clinical decision-making."
41388426,Sepsis and septic shock case identification from electronic health records: an open-source workflow and comparison of cohorts by criteria.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Deploying clinical criteria to identify patients with sepsis from the electronic health record is challenging. We sought to build an open-source data workflow for sepsis and septic shock case identification using three distinct criteria and assess the identified cohorts. METHODS: We developed a workflow from raw data queries through case identification using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event (CDC ASE), Sepsis-3, and International Classification of Diseases criteria. The workflow was then applied to patient encounters between 2012 and 2024 across 25 emergency departments and hospitals in an integrated health system. Separate cohorts of sepsis and septic shock patients by criteria were derived, restricted to a patient's first sepsis encounter, and compared. Pairwise agreement was evaluated with Cohen's kappa (kappa) and Jaccard index. RESULTS: Our programming code for the complete workflow is available on a public platform. We identified 302,112 patients with sepsis and 59,043 with septic shock who met one or more of the three criteria. Multiple criteria were satisfied for only 35% of patients meeting at least one sepsis criterion and 45% of patients meeting at least one septic shock criterion. Pairwise agreement was the highest between CDC ASE and Sepsis-3 criteria for both sepsis (kappa = 0.39, Jaccard index = 0.31) and septic shock (kappa = 0.53, Jaccard index = 0.37). Characteristics and outcomes of patients differed across cohorts identified with the three criteria. Patients meeting both CDC ASE and Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis and septic shock were more severely ill and had high in-hospital mortality incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our open-source workflow is useful for individuals seeking to build and analyze sepsis and septic shock cohorts. Agreement between case criteria was fair to moderate. Clinicians, researchers, and quality improvement practitioners who identify patient cohorts with sepsis and septic shock retrospectively should consider applying multiple criteria."
41388251,Respiratory National Early Warning Score for 28-day mortality prediction in suspected sepsis patients in the emergency department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Most early warning scores were derived in heterogeneous acutely ill populations and are not specifically tailored to patients with suspected sepsis in the emergency department (ED). In sepsis, respiratory rate (RR) is frequently elevated as part of the pathophysiologic response, suggesting that sepsis-focused tools may require recalibrated RR thresholds. We therefore aimed to develop and evaluate the Respiratory National Early Warning Score (R-NEWS), a sepsis-oriented modification emphasizing respiratory parameters, to improve prediction of 28- and 7-day mortality among ED patients with suspected sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in the ED of Thammasat University Hospital, enrolling adults with suspected sepsis and excluding those with cardiac arrest or do-not-resuscitate orders. Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression identified significant predictors of 28-day mortality, which were then used to construct the R-NEWS scoring system. Predictive performance was evaluated and compared with NEWS, qSOFA, and SIRS using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC). RESULTS: A total of 1,348 patients were analyzed; 28-day mortality was 13.4%. Five independent predictors were identified: respiratory rate, need for supplemental oxygen, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale. R-NEWS demonstrated good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.474) and higher discrimination than NEWS, qSOFA, and SIRS. The AuROC of R-NEWS was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68, 0.76) for 28-day mortality and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71, 0.81) for 7-day mortality. Internal validation using bootstrapping yielded consistent results. High-risk R-NEWS (>/= 7) was associated with a 28-day mortality of 28.9%, compared with 3.9% in the low-risk group (</= 3). CONCLUSION: R-NEWS, a simplified five-parameter score emphasizing respiratory function, demonstrated favorable performance for predicting short- and intermediate-term mortality in ED patients with suspected sepsis. Used alongside clinical judgment, R-NEWS may aid early risk stratification and sepsis management. External, multicenter validation and prospective evaluation are warranted before widespread implementation."
41388089,"Bilateral retropharyngeal course of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries: implications for neck dissection.",2025,"PURPOSE: To report a case of tongue cancer with an exceptionally rare bilateral retropharyngeal course of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and to underscore the critical role of preoperative imaging for performing a safe neck dissection. METHODS: An 81-year-old woman was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue. Preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a unique vascular anomaly, with the bilateral carotid systems coursing retropharyngeally. Based on this detailed radiological assessment, she underwent a partial glossectomy and a modified radical neck dissection under general anesthesia. RESULTS: Guided by the preoperative three-dimensional anatomical evaluation, the carotid arteries were identified and preserved early in the procedure, which was completed without abnormal hemorrhage (estimated blood loss: 76 mL). The final pathological diagnosis was pT2N0M0. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by multiorgan failure secondary to sepsis, unrelated to any vascular injury, and she ultimately expired. The cervical wound healing was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Neck dissection can be performed safely even in the presence of complex carotid artery anomalies. Meticulous preoperative radiological evaluation and tailored surgical planning are indispensable for averting catastrophic vascular complications. Head and neck surgeons must maintain a high index of suspicion for such anatomical variations."
41387791,Janibacter melonis bacteremia following autologous stem cell mobilization in lymphoma: a case report and literature review.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Janibacter melonis is a rare opportunistic pathogen capable of causing bacteremia even in healthy individuals, yet reports in hematologic malignancy are limited. This case represents one of the few documented infections in this context, with details on diagnostic confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old female with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma developed Janibacter melonis bacteremia following autologous stem cell mobilization. The patient was immunocompromised as a result of prior therapy with a CD20 monoclonal antibody and intensive chemotherapy. She presented with fever and elevated inflammatory markers after consuming possibly spoiled kiwi fruit. Blood cultures identified Janibacter melonis, confirmed by 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed relatively weak activity of penicillins, cephalosporins, erythromycin, and clindamycin against the Janibacter melonis strain, whereas fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, glycopeptides, carbapenems, sulfonamides, rifampin, linezolid, and daptomycin had lower MICs; nitrofurantoin was inactive. The patient was treated successfully with cefoperazone-sulbactam, resulting in resolution of fever and normalization of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of considering rare infections in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematologic malignancies. Prompt microbiological and molecular diagnosis, combined with targeted therapy, is essential for good outcomes. This report also provides useful insights for managing Janibacter melonis infections."
41387691,Vancomycin heteroresistance (hVISA) in MRSA links to treatment failure and supports a revised PAP-AUC threshold.,2025,"Heteroresistance to vancomycin among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic problem in clinical microbiology. In this prospective cohort study of 842 adult patients with MRSA bacteremia in S. Korea, we investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical implications of the heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) phenotype. The hVISA phenotype is detected in 22% of cases. Multivariable regression analysis reveals strong positive associations between hVISA and hospital-acquired infection, prior anti-MRSA therapy, vancomycin exposure, and particularly vancomycin MIC (odds ratio 15.2 per 1 mg/L increase, p < 0.001). Strikingly, patients infected with hVISA strains have a lower 90-day mortality compared to those with fully susceptible strains (hazard ratio 0.66, p = 0.019), suggesting a possible trade-off between resistance and virulence. However, in hVISA strains treated with vancomycin, outcomes reverse: mortality more than doubled (HR 2.5, p < 0.001), bacteremia persisted longer, and relapse rates increased fivefold. Using maximally selected rank statistics, we identify a PAP-AUC threshold of 0.65 as the first clinically derived breakpoint predictive of mortality risk, providing an actionable definition of vancomycin heteroresistance. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of hVISA, and support routine testing for heteroresistance to inform treatment decisions."
41387134,Responsible adoption of multimodal artificial intelligence in health care: promises and challenges.,2025,"Clinicians rely on various data modalities-such as patient history, clinical signs, imaging, and laboratory results-to improve decision making. Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems are emerging as powerful tools to process these diverse data types; however, the clinical adoption of multimodal AI systems is challenging because of data heterogeneity and integration complexities. The 2024 Temerty Centre for AI Research and Education in Medicine symposium, held on June 17, 2024, in Toronto, Canada, explored the potential and challenges of implementing multimodal AI in health care. In this Review, we summarise insights from the symposium. We discuss current applications, such as those used in early diagnosis of sepsis and cardiology, and identify key barriers, including fusion techniques, model selection, generalisation, fairness, safety, security, and international considerations on the responsible deployment of multimodal AI in health care. We outline practical strategies to overcome these obstacles, emphasising technologies such as federated learning to reduce bias and promote equitable health care. By addressing these challenges, multimodal AI can transform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes worldwide."
41385588,Blood RNA biomarkers and a point-of-care elastase assay for detecting host immune activation in suspected sepsis: Trajectory matters.,2025,"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: The chances of survival from sepsis are improved by early diagnosis and treatment. In the prospective SENSOR study, RNA biomarkers of innate immune neutrophil activation were examined in emergency department (ED) patients triggering an automated sepsis alert. We hypothesized that higher levels of blood RNA biomarkers related to neutrophil activation would be associated with progression to more severe forms of sepsis. METHODS: Adult patients in the ED triggering a sepsis alert were consented, enrolled, and study samples were obtained during the ED visit. Additionally, study samples were collected from a convenience sample of 16 adult non-ED controls and 8 other adults with self-described infectious illnesses. Blood samples were drawn in RNA preservative (Tempus) and whole blood RNA was analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for RNA transcripts related to neutrophil response to infection by bacterial (DEFA1; ALPL, IL8RB/CXCR2), and viral (IFI27, RSAD2) pathogens. Bacterial burden in blood was quantitated by ddPCR of 16S ribosomal DNA. Separately, neutrophil elastase was measured in immunomagnetically captured CD66b+ neutrophils by a novel point-of-care device. RESULTS: Patients were grouped using both 'Sepsis-2' SIRS criteria, adjudicated by independent physicians, and 'Sepsis-3' criteria which uses a qSOFA score for categorizing the severity of illness. Across 72 enrolled sepsis alert patients, 62.5% showed positive RNA biomarkers for bacterial infection, and 8.3% were positive for viral markers, with only 2 cases that showed only a viral signal. Septic patients showed a 4-fold increase in RNA markers vs. those without infection (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in RNA levels between those with sepsis vs those with more severe forms of sepsis. Likewise, RNA biomarker levels did not discriminate patients with qSOFA>/=2 from qSOFA = 1. In a subset of patients with zero and three hour blood samples (n = 27) it was found that changes in RNA levels (up or down), or neutrophil elastase activity, was strongly associated with progression to more severe forms of sepsis or a qSOFA score of >/=2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients progressing to more severe forms of sepsis did not have higher absolute levels of neutrophil activation RNA biomarkers (or higher bacterial burden in blood) compared to patients with sepsis. However, a change in RNA biomarkers or elastase between zero and three hours was strongly indicative of progression to more severe forms of sepsis."
41385537,Neuro-ophthalmology of Infectious Diseases.,2025,"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization, infections, particularly sepsis, are linked to over 20% mortality worldwide and are leading cause of morbidity. A variety of infections have neuro-ophthalmic manifestations. The profile of infectious agents, clinical manifestations, severity, and prognosis of these diseases are highly heterogeneous, and it is therefore difficult to make generalized statements about management. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Available literature with regard to individual infectious agents and their neuroophthalmic manifestations or complications was searched using electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Embase. The current study is a review of the literature along with the authors' personal experience in this field. RESULTS: In this review, we describe the key neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of common bacterial, fungal, viral (except HIV, opportunistic infections, and COVID-19 virus), parasitic, and protozoal infections using illustrative examples. CONCLUSIONS: Infections may involve the afferent and efferent visual pathways, as well as higher order visual processing functions. They can directly invade the eye and the brain or may cause damage due to inflammation, necrosis, vascular compromise, and postinfective demyelination. With the shifting geographic boundaries and widespread international migration, the spectrum of infectious neuro-ophthalmic diseases is expanding. Clinical details, dedicated imaging, biochemical, serological, and at times histopathological confirmation aids in making prompt diagnosis."
41385188,Disseminated mycobacteriosis and activation of latent opportunistic infections in the course of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a patient with AIDS: A case report.,2025,"Advanced HIV infection leads to profound immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Resumption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may result in immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which manifests as a worsening of an existing infection or the emergence of new ones. Disseminated mycobacteriosis caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most severe opportunistic infections in the course of AIDS. The aim of this paper is to present the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in a AIDS patient who developed IRIS with generalized MAC infection and numerous metabolic and infectious complications following the resumption of ART, ultimately leading to treatment failure. We describe the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive patient who had discontinued ART for several years. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, and psychiatric data collected during several months of hospitalization were analyzed. A multidisciplinary approach was employed, including antiretroviral, antimycobacterial, antifungal, nutritional, and psychiatric treatment. After ART was resumed, the patient developed IRIS in the form of disseminated MAC infection, confirmed in sputum, blood, and bone marrow. He developed refeeding syndrome, multidrug-resistant sepsis, and fungal and bacterial infections. Despite improved immunological parameters (increased CD4 and decreased HIV viral load), treatment was ineffective due to the patient's lack of compliance and worsening cachexia. This case illustrates the complexity of caring for patients with advanced AIDS and IRIS. Effective treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, early diagnosis of IRIS, and consideration of psychosocial factors that can significantly complicate treatment and prognosis. ."
41384277,Association Between Cytomegalovirus Viremia Clearance and Post-Solid Organ Transplant Mortality in Patients With Refractory Cytomegalovirus Infection: SOLSTICE Post Hoc Analysis.,2025,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection following solid organ transplant (SOT) is associated with increased mortality risk. In the phase 3 SOLSTICE study (NCT02931539), more transplant recipients achieved CMV clearance after 8 weeks with maribavir than investigator-assigned therapy (IAT). In SOLSTICE, SOT recipients with refractory CMV infection were randomized 2:1 to receive maribavir or IAT for 8 weeks. This post hoc analysis assessed the impact of CMV clearance at Week 8 on mortality at Week 20. Patients who achieved CMV clearance at Week 8 were categorized as responders, and patients without CMV clearance, or who received maribavir rescue or alternative treatment, were categorized as nonresponders. All-cause mortality was assessed at Week 20 for responders and nonresponders using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. The analysis included 211 SOT recipients: 97 responders and 114 nonresponders. Week 20 all-cause mortality was significantly higher in nonresponders than responders (p = 0.0024). No deaths were reported in the responder group, and 10 deaths were reported in the nonresponder group (3 receiving IAT, 7 receiving maribavir). Median (range) time from treatment start to death was 30.5 (3-123) days. This analysis is consistent with other studies showing an increased risk of mortality with post-SOT CMV infection."
41383948,The role of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in neuroinflammation.,2025,"Neuroinflammation, a key defense mechanism of the nervous system, is associated with changes in inflammatory markers and stimulation of neuroimmune cells such as microglia and astrocytes. Growing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota and its metabolites directly or indirectly regulate host health. According to recent studies, bacterial dysbiosis in the gut is closely linked to several central nervous system disorders that cause neuroinflammation, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and ischemic stroke. Recent findings indicate a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and central nervous system that influences neuroinflammation and cognitive function. Dysregulation of this system can affect the generation of cytotoxic metabolites, promote neuroinflammation, and impair cognition. This review explores the lesser-studied microbiota-derived metabolites involved in neuroinflammation-bile acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and indole derivatives-as targets for creating new treatment tools for neuroinflammatory illnesses, as well as possible biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis."
41383838,"Clinical Features and Treatment Differences Among Tuberculous, Brucellosis, and Pyogenic Spondylitis: A Cohort Study.",2025,"PURPOSE: There was an increasing incidence of spinal infections. This study aimed to compare and contrast the clinical characteristics and treatment regimens for diverse types of spondylitis and to provide guidance for clinicians to make timely diagnosis and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five patients with spinal infections admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from October 2019 to December 2024 were recruited. The patients were classified as having tuberculous spondylitis (TBS), brucellosis spondylitis (BS), or pyogenic spondylitis (PS). The patient's treatment regimen and course were dynamically followed up during hospitalization and after discharge. Comparisons of clinical characteristics and treatment among the three groups were performed by SPSS 26.0 and GraphPad Prism 10 statistical software. RESULTS: The proportion of male patients was greater than female patients (65.00% vs 35.00%). Fever accompanied by pain was more prevalent in the BS and PS groups than in the TBS group (P=0.003). Compared with the TBS and BS groups, the PS group had the shortest duration from symptom onset to hospitalization (P<0.001). Sepsis, invasive manipulation, elevated inflammatory markers, psoas abscesses, and the involvement of three or more vertebrae were significantly associated with the PS. In this study, the median duration of treatment was 77 weeks for TBS, 19 weeks for BS, and 13 weeks for PS. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) should be monitored during treatment. Our results indicated that omadacycline and contezolid exhibited remarkable efficacy in the treatment of spinal infections. CONCLUSION: Patients of spinal infections with diverse etiologies presented varied clinical features and risk factors, the treatment should be individualized. Due to the long course of treatment, ADRs need to be monitored during treatment, and newer drugs such as omadacycline and contezolid are efficacious and have favorable safety profiles."
41383531,Congenital Syngnathia With Holoprosencephaly: A Case Report of a Fatal Presentation in a Resource-Limited Setting.,2025,"Congenital syngnathia, the rare fusion of the maxilla and mandible, poses significant feeding and respiratory challenges. Its management is complicated by rarity and potential syndromic associations. We present a 1-week-old female neonate who presented with left jaw deviation, respiratory distress (SpO(2) 69%, tachypnea), and fever. Examination revealed near-complete inability to open the mouth except for a small right paramedical gap. A CT scan confirmed left maxilla-mandibular bony fusion (Laster type 2b, Dawson type 2b), mandibular hypoplasia, semilobar holoprosencephaly, corpus callosal dysgenesis, a dorsal cyst, and microcephaly. Concurrent neonatal sepsis was diagnosed. Management included antibiotics, NG tube feeding, and oxygen support. Surgical intervention was deferred due to critical instability. Despite supportive care, the infant's condition deteriorated, resulting in fatal respiratory failure. This case underscores the lethal potential of congenital syngnathia when compounded by severe CNS malformations. The CNS anomalies induced hypoventilation and aspiration, making surgery nonviable and leading to sepsis and respiratory failure. The absence of antenatal care prevented early detection and tertiary delivery planning. Prompt neuroimaging is crucial, and prognosis is heavily dictated by CNS comorbidities, necessitating consideration of palliative prioritization in resource-limited settings."
41383080,Carotid Doppler and IVC metrics for volume and mortality assessment in septic shock.,2025,"The utility of carotid artery Doppler flow velocity (CADFV) over mortality is not well known. This study investigated the utility of bedside ultrasound in assessing volume status and predicting mortality in patients with septic shock with CADFV, the inferior vena cava collapse index, and the central venous pressure (CVP). This prospective observational study included adults admitted to the ED with septic shock, defined by hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg) and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. Patient demographics, CVP, CADFV, inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVCCI), and outcomes were recorded. Measurements are compared in terms of mortality. The mean age was 67 years, with a 57% mortality rate. ROC analysis revealed that CADFV predicted mortality with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 68% at a cutoff of 50 cm/s. The IVCCI had 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity at a cutoff of 54.5%. The CVP had 61% sensitivity and 71% specificity at a cutoff of 1.5 mm H(2)O. The mean IVCCI was 59%, and the mean CVP was 2.4 mmH(2)O. The mean IVCCI was 59%, and the mean CVP was 2.4 mmH(2)O. The deceased patients had a mean IVCCI of 63% and a mean CVP of 1.62 mmH(2)O, whereas discharged patients had a mean IVCCI of 55% and a mean CVP of 3.45 mmH(2)O. CADFV, IVCCI, and CVP can be used in evaluating the volume status and predicting mortality in septic shock. These noninvasive measures provide alternatives to invasive methods and facilitate timely intervention in emergency care."
41382140,Predictors of acute gangrenous cholecystitis and its complications: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Acute gangrenous cholecystitis is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis. Predictors of its development and of its complications are not well established. The aims of our study were to determine factors related to acute gangrenous cholecystitis and its complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent surgery for acute cholecystitis between 2010 and 2022 at a tertiary referral center. Data was collected from patients' medical records. Pathology reports were reviewed to differentiate acute gangrenous cholecystitis from acute non-gangrenous cholecystitis. Acute gangrenous cholecystitis was defined by the presence of focal or diffuse necrosis of the gallbladder wall on histopathologic examination. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic indicators were compared between acute gangrenous and acute non-gangrenous cholecystitis groups. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors that are associated with acute gangrenous cholecystitis and its complications. RESULTS: Among 356 patients with acute cholecystitis, 121 had acute gangrenous cholecystitis and 9 were diagnosed preoperatively. Acute gangrenous cholecystitis was associated with age, male sex, comorbidities, presence of rebound tenderness, higher white blood cells count and bilirubin, and greater thickness of the gallbladder wall and gallbladder diameter. Patients with acute gangrenous cholecystitis were more likely to have sepsis and longer hospital stay. On multivariate analysis, age, male gender, gallbladder diameter and presence of pericholecystic abscess were associated with acute gangrenous cholecystitis. Age and diabetes were associated with sepsis in acute cholecystitis. Time from presentation to surgery was similar between the acute gangrenous and the non-gangrenous cholecystitis groups. CONCLUSION: Acute gangrenous cholecystitis is common, and preoperative diagnosis is often missed. Our data suggests that considering age, co-morbidities and radiological indicators may be important to inform decision making in patients with acute cholecystitis and might facilitate timely diagnosis and optimize the medical and surgical management of those with acute gangrenous cholecystitis."
41382032,Time against tissue: case reports of fungal necrotizing fasciitis and the cost of delayed aggressive interventions.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare disease that causes the necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and muscle fascia in patients, and if not diagnosed and treated in due time may lead to the extreme morbidity and even death, with the mortality rate ranging from 6 to 33%. Fungal necrotizing fasciitis is even more rare and life threatening because of aggressive infection and less response to medical treatment. Literature has reported three times higher mortality rate in patients, who had positive fungal cultures and requiring multiple surgical detriments. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We are reporting cases of patients who were diagnosed and managed with fungal necrotizing fasciitis in a tertiary care hospital. CASE 1: A 45-year-old farmer with a non-healing abdominal wound later diagnosed with fungal necrotizing fasciitis, which improved after surgical debridement and anti-fungal treatment. The patient recovered after follow-up treatments. CASE 2: A 74-year-old diabetic man developed a groin wound that progressed to necrotizing fasciitis. Despite treatment, fungal cultures revealed growth of Candida tropicalis, Apophysomyces elegans, and Rhizopus species. The patient's condition deteriorated and he passed away after the family opted for comfort care. CASE 3: A 54-year-old diabetic male involved in a road traffic accident developed sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. Despite treatment and support the patient succumbed to his condition. CONCLUSION: Fungal necrotizing fasciitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to delayed recognition and treatment. Early surgical debridement along with empirical antifungal therapy should be considered standard practice. The report emphasizes the importance of early fungal cultures and timely, aggressive treatment to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes."
41382004,Prognostic performance of the temperature- and age-modified shock index for children with sepsis and septic shock: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric septic shock is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Lactate levels are monitored to determine the quality of sepsis treatment; however, some rural hospitals have restricted access to lactate measurements because of limited resources. This study evaluated the prognostic performance of the temperature- and age-modified shock index (TAMSI) for sepsis and septic shock in children and its ability to predict morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data on children with sepsis or septic shock (age 1 month-15 years) who were admitted to the Songklanagarind Hospital pediatric intensive care unit between January 2017 and May 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Vital signs were collected at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h (t0, t1, t6, t12, t24, respectively) after sepsis diagnosis. The TAMSI cutoff scores according to age groups were referenced from the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines. RESULTS: The final analysis included 300 children (171 [57%] male children) with a mean age of 73.9 months (standard deviation [SD], 63.5 months); 192 (67%) of these children were immunocompromised. The median pediatric risk of mortality score was 6 (interquartile range, 3-10). Eighty-two (27.3%) deaths occurred. The TAMSI areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h for predicting mortality were 0.55, 0.58, 0.62, 0.66, and 0.67, respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, an abnormal TAMSI at t6 was significantly associated with hospital mortality (abnormal TAMSI at t0 and abnormal TAMSI at t6: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-6.13; P = 0.003; normal TAMSI at t0 and abnormal TAMSI at t6: aOR, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.48-14.63; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the PALS guidelines, an abnormal TAMSI at 6 h after sepsis was significantly associated with mortality. The TAMSI can be a useful noninvasive monitoring tool for pediatric sepsis or septic shock at resource-limited hospitals. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12873-025-01439-x."
41381591,"Risk prediction model for neonatal mortality among neonates hospitalized with sepsis, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",2025,"Neonatal sepsis is a significant public health challenge across the globe, particularly, in low-resource settings. While early identification of at-risk patients is a recommended approach to reduce sepsis- related deaths, there is limited evidence from low-resource settings. Therefore, this study aimed to develop prediction models to estimate neonatal mortality among neonates with sepsis. The study was conducted among 975 neonates diagnosed with sepsis in the NICUs of two large hospitals in Bahir Dar city. Data were analyzed in R software, and regression analyses were performed. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and calibration plot were used to assess model performance, and internal validation was performed using bootstrapping technique. Sepsis accounted for 27.9% of neonatal deaths. Key predictors of mortality were low birth weight, late initiation of breastfeeding, gestational age, fifth-minute Apgar score, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and convulsions. The original and nomogram models demonstrated an AUC of 81.3% and 81.2%, respectively. In conclusion, the high incidence of sepsis-attributed mortality highlights the need for effective predictive tools. The nomogram, based on key clinical predictors such as low birth weight, late initiation of breastfeeding, prematurity, fifth-minute apgar score, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and convulsions, demonstrated very good discrimination, and calibration performances, These findings support the use of the model as a practical tool for early risk stratification and clinical decision-making in neonatal intensive care settings."
41380845,Prognosis of central venous catheter-related Candida infection during hospitalization in conventional medical or surgical wards: A 13-year retrospective cohort study.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: While catheter-related Candida infections in intensive care settings are well-described, data from conventional medical or surgical wards remain limited. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of catheter-related Candida infections in such settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study from 2008 to 2022, including patients with confirmed catheter-related Candida infection. Diagnosis was based on a positive central blood culture, along with either a positive peripheral blood culture, local inflammatory signs, or radiological signs suggesting catheter-related candidemia. The main outcome was either transfer to the intensive care unit or death within 30 days. RESULTS: Following a univariate analysis, 15 (30 %) patients among a total of 50 had an unfavorable outcome: eight (16 %) were transferred to the intensive care unit, and seven (14 %) died within 30 days. Poor outcome was associated with age over 60 years, clinical severity, and positive mannan biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Catheter-related Candida infections in non-critical care settings are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Fungal biomarkers may hold clinically relevant prognostic value, necessitating further investigations."

Median survival remains 6-12 months across various therapeutic approaches. We evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of epcoritamab monotherapy, a subcutaneous CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, in patients with Richter transformation. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was conducted at 24 centres in nine countries (Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, and USA). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed Richter transformation (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and up to two previous lines of Richter transformation-directed therapy. The trial includes dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases. The expansion groups evaluate epcoritamab monotherapy (group 2A), epcoritamab plus lenalidomide (group 2B), and epcoritamab plus the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP; group 2C). The current report describes results from group 2A. Epcoritamab was administered subcutaneously in step-up doses followed by 48 mg every week for cycles 1-3, every 2 weeks for cycles 4-9, and every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate per Lugano 2014 criteria in the full analysis set (all patients who received >/=1 dose of epcoritamab). It was evaluated against a null hypothesis of 30% versus an alternative of 50%. Prespecified subgroup analyses by line of therapy for Richter transformation and TP53 aberration and/or del(17p) status were performed. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04623541. FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2021, and March 21, 2025, we enrolled 42 patients with Richter transformation. The median age was 69 years (range 50-80); and 32 (76%) of 42 patients were male and ten (24%) were female. Race or ethnicity data were available for 40 patients (37 [88%] identified as White, two [5%] as Asian, and one [2%] as Black or African American; ethnicity was not reported for two patients). The median time from diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma to Richter transformation was 7.6 years (range 0-23.9). 21 (50%) of 42 patients received epcoritamab as first-line Richter transformation-directed therapy. At a median follow-up of 22.9 months (range 0.5-39.9), 20 of 42 patients had a response with an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 47.6% (95% CI 32.0-63.6), which did not meet the prespecified alternative hypothesis (50%). Overall response occurred in 12 of 21 patients in the first-line population (overall response rate 57.1%, 34.0-78.2), in eight of 21 patients in the second-line or later-line population (38.1%, 18.1-61.6), and in eight of 20 patients with TP53 aberration and/or del(17p) alteration at baseline (40%, 19.1-63.9). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia in 19 (45%) of 42 patients, anaemia in 16 (38%) patients, thrombocytopenia in 16 (38%) patients, infection in nine (21%) patients, pneumonia in four (10%) patients, and COVID-19 in two (5%) patients. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 36 (86%) patients with three (7%) being grade 3, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in five (12%; all grade 1-2) patients and clinical tumour lysis syndrome in two (5%; all grade 1-2) patients. Three fatal adverse events were reported, one each due to general physical health deterioration in the context of progressive disease, sepsis, and cerebrovascular accident; none were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. INTERPRETATION: In patients with Richter transformation, epcoritamab monotherapy showed clinically meaningful antitumour activity, although the investigator-assessed overall response rate was below the alternative hypothesis of 50%, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies. These findings support further investigation of epcoritamab as a potential treatment option for patients with Richter transformation. FUNDING: Genmab A/S and AbbVie."
41380407,Risk factors and outcomes of bloodstream infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria in adult patients with acute leukemia.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection(BSI) caused by multidrug-resistant(MDR) strains is associated with high mortality rates. Notably, there remains a lack of research data addressing the resistance profiles, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of multidrug-resistant bacterial bloodstream infection(MDR-BSI) in acute leukemia(AL) patients. This study aims to analyze mortality, risk factors for death, and causative bacterial characteristics in AL patients with MDR-BSI. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data from patients hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in China between January 2020 and December 2024, diagnosed with AL and concurrent MDR-BSI. Bacterial distribution was summarized. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Logistic regression analysis were employed to assess 30-day mortality and identify risk factors for death following MDR-BSI onset. RESULTS: 152 patients were enrolled, yielding 152 MDR bacteria isolates. Gram-negative bacteria(GNB) predominate in MDR-BSI. The overall 30-day mortality rate for MDR-BSI patients was 23.0 %, while the mortality rate specifically for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae(CRE) BSI patients was significantly higher at 42.9 %. Univariate analysis identified the following factors associated with 30-day mortality: male sex, smoking history, CRE colonization, Intensive Care Unit(ICU)admission, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, septic shock, relapsed/refractory disease status, pulmonary infection, prior carbapenem use, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated procalcitonin(PCT) levels. Multivariate analysis subsequently demonstrated that CRE colonization(OR=5.938,95 %CI:1.547-22.790,p =0.009), Smoking history(OR=6.532,95 %CI:1.658-25.729,p = 0.007), and Septic shock(OR=50.599, 95 %CI:14.670-174.525, p ＜0.001) were independent risk factors for mortality in MDR-BSI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Adult AL patients with MDR-BSI face elevated mortality, where smoking, CRE colonization, and septic shock constitute critical risk factors; consequently, Smoking cessation counseling, screening for intestinal CRE colonization, early recognition of septic shock, and judicious antibiotic therapy may significantly reduce 30-day Mortality in AL Patients with MDR-BSI."
41380288,Prognostic value of suPAR in sepsis: a potential tool to support patient management in the Emergency Department.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: The soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a well-established biomarker of immune activation, reflecting the severity of systemic inflammation. Recent evidence showed increasing interest in suPAR as a prognostic marker, with elevated levels consistently associated with greater disease severity and mortality, in different clinical settings. METHODS: In this retrospective study, suPAR levels were assayed at Emergency Department admission in patients who received a diagnosis of sepsis or systemic infection during their initial clinical workup, using an automated turbidimetric assay (suPARnostic ViroGates kit on Atellica CH analyzer Siemens). The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the association between baseline suPAR levels and mortality, while the secondary endpoint aimed to explore their potential as indicators of clinical severity and predictors of patient outcomes. RESULTS: suPAR levels were elevated in all patients (median 6.99 mug/L) consistent with the severity of their clinical condition. A threshold of 10.2 mug/L was strongly associated with mortality, while a cut-off of 5.96 mug/L identified patients with severe disease and prolonged hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: suPAR seems to be a reliable, rapid, and clinically useful prognostic biomarker in the Emergency Department in patients with sepsis or systemic infections. Its early measurement by turbidimetric immunoassay in automation can support risk stratification, improve triage decisions, and enhance the management of these patients."
41380064,Triage Temperature and Timeliness of Sepsis Interventions in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Fever as an indicator of infection is frequently used as an aid in triggering concern for sepsis in the emergency department (ED). Adults with sepsis presenting to the ED with a normal temperature have been shown to have delays in treatment and greater mortality. The association between temperature and timeliness of sepsis-related care in the ED remains poorly characterized in children. Our objective in this study was to measure the association between body temperature at the physiologic onset of sepsis and the time to initiation of antibiotic treatment and fluid bolus among children with clinically defined sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of pediatric patients with sepsis presenting to the ED. Data collected from an existing quality improvement database were supplemented via chart extraction. We assessed body temperature at physiologic onset of sepsis (PO-S), the date and time when a patient first met clinical criteria for sepsis as defined by Goldstein et al. Our primary outcomes were time from PO-S and administration of antibiotics and fluid bolus. Secondary outcomes included maximum vasoactive-inotropic scores, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) within 30 days of presentation, presence and type of organ dysfunction, 30-day hospital- and intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, and mortality. We summarized and compared data by temperature group. Multivariable quantile regression was used to evaluate adjusted associations between body temperature and time to initiation of antibiotic treatment and fluid bolus. RESULTS: Of 928 patients screened, 385 (41%) met inclusion criteria. Median time to antibiotic treatment did not differ between temperature groups at PO-S-</= 36.0  degrees C: median (IQR) 48.5, (41.3-104.8); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: median, 95.5, (41.3-104.8;), and >/= 38.0  degrees C: median 84, 45-151; (P = .24). Median time to fluid bolus administration also did not differ between temperature groups at PO-S-</= 36.0  degrees C: median 39, (20.8-65.8); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: median, 42.5 (21.3-86.3); and >/= 38.0  degrees C: median, 54 (29-84); (P =.07). In addition, mortality differed by temperature at PO-S (</= 36.0  degrees C: 1/22 (4.5%); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: 4/80 (5.0%); and >/=. 38.0  degrees C: 3/283 (1.1%), (P = .04); as did organ dysfunction at 72 hours: </=. 36.0  degrees C: 15/22 (68.2%); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: 43/80 (53.8%), >/= 38.0  degrees C: 74/283 (26.1%); (P < .001) and median (IQR) 30-day ICU- and hospital-free days-</= 36.0  degrees C: median, 24, (20,-26.8); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: median, 28 (24.8-30), >/= 38.0  degrees C: median, 30 (27-30), (P < .001); and at </=. 36.0 degrees C: median, 22, (17-25); 36.1-37.9  degrees C: median, 24 (17.8-27); >/= 38.0  degrees C: median, 25 (20, 27), (P = .04), respectively. We did not observe an association between temperature and median time to antibiotic administration (beta: 2.5, 95% CI, -4.2 to 9.1, P = .50) or first fluid bolus administration (beta: 1.7, 95% CI, -1.4 to 4.8, P = .30). CONCLUSION: Time to fluid bolus administration and time to antibiotic administration did not differ statistically by temperature from physiological onset of sepsis. Children presenting with hypothermia (</= 36.0  degrees C) had worse outcomes."
41380052,Grouping of Emergency Department-based Cardiac Arrest Patients According to Clinical Features to Assess Patient Outcomes.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: While research has begun to understand emergency department-based cardiac arrest (EDCA), consensus on what exactly constitutes EDCA remains unknown. In this study we aimed to explore the grouping of EDCA by using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm and to investigate how these underlying clusters related to patient outcomes. METHODS: We retrieved electronic health record data from an ED in a tertiary medical center. The EDCAs were identified via the cardiopulmonary resuscitation log. We used k-means cluster analysis to group EDCAs and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for visualization. Primary outcomes were ED mortality and ED length of stay (LOS). The analyses were repeated using an independent ED data set, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) dataset. RESULTS: From 2019 to 2022, there were 366 EDCA events. Cluster analysis identified three distinct clusters (Cluster 1 or immediate risk, n=54 [15%]; Cluster 2 or early risk, n=274 [75%]; Cluster 3 or late risk, n=38 [10%]). Cluster 1 patients had the shortest median time to EDCA (< 1 hour), followed by Cluster 2 (3 hours) and Cluster 3 (81 hours). Near cardiac arrest at triage was the most common cause of EDCA in Cluster 1, while respiratory illnesses and sepsis were more common in Cluster 3. The causes of EDCA in Cluster 2 were diverse, with predominantly cardiovascular and neurologic emergencies. The t-SNE revealed farther distances from Cluster 1 to the other two clusters, suggesting its most critical nature. Cluster 3 had the highest mortality (58%), followed by Clusters 1 (48%) and 2 (35%) (P = .01). Cluster 1 had the shortest median LOS (median, 4 hours), while Cluster 3 had the longest LOS (81 hours) (P < .001). In the independent data set, Cluster 1 remained, but Clusters 2 and 3 appeared to merge due to a shorter ED LOS overall. CONCLUSION: We identified three novel clusters (immediate, early, and late risk) with distinct patterns in clinical presentation, putative causes of ED-based cardiac arrest, and ED outcomes. Understanding these clinical phenotypes may help develop cluster-specific interventions to prevent EDCA or intervene most appropriately. Cluster 1 patients may benefit from resuscitation efforts, and Clusters 2 or 3 patients can benefit from timely interventions for cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic emergencies. In addition, for patients with prolonged ED boarding, periodic monitoring with an early warning system may prevent a cardiac arrest event."
41380051,Anticoagulation Treatment in Patients with Septic Thrombophlebitis of the Internal Jugular Vein.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (STIJV), or Lemierre syndrome, is a rare, life-threatening condition. Anticoagulant use for managing STIJV remains unclear due to ambiguous diagnostic criteria and a lack of robust evidence. We evaluated the clinical benefits and risks of anticoagulants in patients with STIJV. METHODS: In this retrospective study we used data from over 1,700 hospitals, retrieved from a nationwide Japanese database. We used multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching to adjust for confounding variables (age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, level of consciousness, use of mechanical ventilation, use of disseminated intravascular coagulation, admission to intensive care unit, history of diabetes, use of noradrenaline, diagnosis of acute renal failure, and diagnosis of cerebral infarction). We also conducted instrumental variable estimation to account for the impact of unmeasured covariates. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; the secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, major bleeding events, and length of stay (LOS) in hospital. RESULTS: Among the 523 patients diagnosed with STIJV between April 1, 2014-March 31, 2022, 343 (65.6%) were excluded due to lack of appropriate treatment initiation for STIJV. Overall, 180 patients (34.4%) met the inclusion criteria; the data of 156 patients (31.1%) were ultimately analysed. Of these, 86 (55.1%) received anticoagulants, which neither significantly improved nor worsened survival outcomes. The in-hospital mortality was 3.39% and 1.69% and 90-day mortality was 2.54% and 1.69%, respectively, in patients who did and did not receive therapy, (P = .56 and .99, respectively). The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for in-hospital and 90-day mortality was 0.858 (95% CI, 0.126-5.826, P = .88) and .991 (95% CI, .932-1.055, P = .79), respectively. The LOS was longer in those receiving anticoagulants (mean, 29.2 vs 21.8 days, AOR 11.7 days longer, 95% CI, 4.11-19.20, P < .01), potentially due to dose adjustment or clinical decision-making. Subgroup analysis comparing unfractionated heparin and direct Xa inhibitors showed similar in-hospital mortality outcomes: 4.54% in the unfractionated heparin group (AOR 2.361, 95% CI, 0.32-17.40; P = .40) and 3.03% in the direct Xa inhibitor group (AOR 0.444, 95% CI, 0.032-6.23; P = .55), respectively. CONCLUSION: In the largest study of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein to date, we found that early initiation of anticoagulation treatment was not statistically associated with survival. Therefore, anticoagulant use should be determined based on individual patient characteristics. Further research is warranted to improve the quality of evidence for this rare disease."
41378273,"Pancreatitis Unveiled: Linking Pathogenesis, Organ Failure, and Emerging Predictive Biomarkers.",2025,"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition that starts as a mild illness but can progress to become fatal through multi-organ failure with high death rates. The APACHE II and BISAP scoring systems help identify patient risks, but their ability to forecast early deterioration remains limited during the initial hours following admission when critical decisions need to be made. This review examines the mechanisms linking pancreatic injury to systemic inflammation and organ failure, outlining the distinction between early sterile organ failure and later sepsis-related failure. Clinical patterns of organ dysfunction correlate strongly with the inflammatory response, and early indicators such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome duration, rising blood urea nitrogen, hemoconcentration, and increasing CRP provide useful predictors of disease severity. Emerging biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8, circulating histones, angiopoietin-2, arterial lactate, and albumin-based ratios, show promise for forecasting persistent organ failure. Integrating these markers with machine learning algorithms and multi-cytokine panels enhances predictive accuracy for patient risk assessment and early intensive care unit admission. Although promising, most of these biomarkers and AI-based tools remain investigational and require further multicenter validation. Future research should prioritize standardized assay methods and prospective evaluation of combined clinical-biomarker-AI models to determine their true impact on early diagnosis, triage, and patient outcomes."
41377779,"Febrile Rash, Shock, and Hyperferritinaemia in A Young Woman: Navigating the Diagnostic Overlap of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, Toxic Shock, and Viral Exanthema.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Fever, rash, and shock in adults pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Markedly elevated ferritin often raises suspicion for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), yet hyperferritinaemia is also encountered in sepsis, adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and viral infections. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman who developed a high fever, diffuse erythematous rash, hypotension, and markedly elevated ferritin levels. The initial differential diagnoses included toxic shock syndrome, HLH, AOSD, and viral exanthema. Extensive evaluations for infectious, autoimmune, and malignant diseases were negative. Imaging demonstrated gallstones with gallbladder wall inflammation, which was likely the trigger for the systemic inflammatory response. With supportive care and early multidisciplinary input, the patient made a full recovery without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of contextualising ferritin elevation and maintaining a broad differential diagnosis. Serial laboratory trends, careful use of HLH scoring systems, and multidisciplinary collaboration prevented premature immunosuppression and ensured a favourable outcome. LEARNING POINTS: Hyperferritinaemia is a useful biomarker but highly non-specific and must be interpreted within the broader clinical context.Serial trends in inflammatory markers and use of scoring tools such as the HScore guide safe decision-making in suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.Early multidisciplinary review helps prevent unnecessary immunosuppression and ensures timely supportive care."
41377588,Total knee arthroplasty in patients with cardiomyopathy: A large matched cohort analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with cardiomyopathy, such as primary, infectious, inflammatory, secondary, and unspecified cardiomyopathy, may need total knee arthroplasty. This study aims to investigate the demographic and thirty-day postoperative complications of patients with cardiomyopathy who receive TKA. METHODS: The PearlDiver database was utilized to develop a retrospective cohort study. Patients of all demographics diagnosed with cardiomyopathy who underwent TKA based on the ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT diagnosis codes were included. A collection of preoperative and postoperative variables was compared between patients with cardiomyopathy and those without cardiomyopathy following TKA. A matched and unmatched univariant analysis was conducted to compare these two populations using a 1:1 propensity match algorithm. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, and odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were reported. RESULTS: In 163,625 patients with cardiomyopathy, patients were older and had a 3.076 times greater risk of congestive heart failure (p < 0.0001), 2.4537 times greater risk of acute myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001), 1.995 times greater risk of postoperative shock (p < 0.0001), 1.2483 times greater risk of deep vein thrombosis (p < 0.0001), 1.5590 times greater risk of pulmonary embolism (p < 0.0001), 1.3694 times greater risk of sepsis (p < 0.0001), 1.3572 times greater risk of acute kidney injury (p < 0.0001)., 1.2277 times greater risk of readmissions (p < 0.0001), 1.2588 times greater risk of revisions (p < 0.0001), and higher risks of local complications such as periprosthetic joint infection (p = 0.0397), periprosthetic mechanical complication (p = 0.0213), manipulation under anesthesia (p = 0.0012) and wound dehiscence (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Cardiomyopathy is associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, postoperative shock, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute kidney injury, readmissions, revisions, periprosthetic joint infection, mechanical complications, manipulation under anesthesia, and wound dehiscence. These results suggest that cardiomyopathy is a critical risk factor of adverse postoperative outcomes following TKA."
41377546,Sepsis and the diverse organ-gastrointestinal tract axis.,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a dysregulated host immune response to infection that culminates in multi-organ dysfunction. Recent advances highlight the gut microbiota's pivotal role in modulating immune responses and influencing the pathophysiology of sepsis through the organ-gastrointestinal tract axis. This review synthesizes current evidence on the bidirectional interplay between gut dysbiosis and the dysfunction of major organ systems-liver, lungs, kidneys, brain, and heart-during sepsis. We explore how gut-derived factors such as microbial translocation, endotoxins, and altered metabolite production exacerbate systemic inflammation and organ injury. In particular, we emphasize the roles of short-chain fatty acids, uremic toxins, bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in mediating immune dysfunction across the gut-organ axes. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota- including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation- show promise in preclinical and early clinical settings. However, challenges related to patient heterogeneity, safety, and the lack of precise biomarkers persist. This review consolidates disparate findings to underscore the gut as a central modulator in sepsis and advocates for microbiota-based interventions as adjunctive therapies in sepsis management."
41377526,Outcome predictors of systemic lupus erythematosus requiring admission to the intensive care unit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for disease flares and infections, both of which carry a high mortality risk. Studies characterizing the outcome predictors of SLE are few in the Asian continent. This study characterized the clinical profile, treatment, and outcome predictors of ICU admissions with SLE. AIM: To ascertain the reasons for ICU admission among SLE patients and to explore outcome predictors in these patients. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included need for ventilation, inotropes, renal replacement therapy, and length of ICU and hospital stay. METHODS: A retrospective study of 77 SLE patients was conducted in the medical ICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of patients admitted between January 2018 and December 2022 were recorded. Factors associated with mortality were explored using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 31.1 (10.3) years; 83.1% were female. The median (interquartile) duration of SLE before admission was 12 (1-60) months; SLE was newly diagnosed in the current admission in 23.4%. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 16.3 (14.5-18.2) and similar among survivors and non-survivors; 32 had evidence of disease flare, 44 had an infection, and one patient had an intracranial bleed. ICU admission was for respiratory failure (46.7%), hemodynamic instability (32.5%), and status epilepticus (14.3%). Twenty-nine patients (37.7%) had autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and 11 (14.3%) had diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Immunomodulation included corticosteroids (96.1%), cyclophosphamide (33.8%), mycophenolate (23.4%), plasma exchange (13%), and immunoglobulins (11.7%). All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Respiratory support, inotropes, and renal replacement therapy were required in 93.5%, 51.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. ICU mortality was 50.7% (95% confidence interval: 39%-62%). The mean +/- SD hospital length of stay was 18.9 +/- 14.3 days. On multivariate analysis, only shock (P = 0.004) was independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Intercurrent infection and disease flare are common reasons for ICU admission in SLE patients. Despite multimodal therapy, mortality is high. Shock was independently associated with mortality."
41377524,Retrospective evaluation of efficacy of CytoSorb((R)) therapy in septic shock patients in a tertiary care intensive care unit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytokines and inflammatory mediators are the key factors that are involved in the pathology of sepsis. Extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption devices offer an innovative clinical support system to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm associated with sepsis. AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of CytoSorb((R)) therapy as an adjunct to standard care in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed. Data were obtained for the patients who were treated with the CytoSorb((R)) adsorber for the past 5 years. The effects of therapy were assessed by changes in vasopressor requirements, specifically, norepinephrine and epinephrine. In addition, cytokine levels, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, as well as substances such as serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase were also evaluated. In addition, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ventilator requirements were also recorded. The survival outcomes were analyzed based on the length of patients' stay in the ICU, and the severity of illness was assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and Sepsis-associated Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores recorded at baseline and post-therapy. RESULTS: Following CytoSorb((R)) therapy, the requirement for vasopressor drugs, particularly norepinephrine, was reduced by 40% and a statistically significant improvement in MAP by 7.8%. Additionally, significant reductions were observed in IL-6 and serum lactate levels by 83% and 52% respectively. Around 56% had a delta lactate score of > 1.5, while 23% patients had a score ranging from 1 to < 1.5, and 16% patients had a score between 0.5 and < 1 and merely 5% patients had a score of </= 0.5. Besides, serum levels of creatinine, procalcitonin and CRP were significantly reduced by 17.2%, 41.5% and 53.8% respectively. There was a significant reduction in scores, including APACHE II [to 23 (18-29) from 27 (23-33)], and SOFA [to 12 (10-14) from 13 (11-15)]. Mechanical ventilation was required by 96% patients, with a median duration of 12 days, and the median length of hospital stay in overall patients was 26 days, while the median ICU stay was 18 days. CONCLUSION: CytoSorb((R)) therapy seems to be a promising adjunctive approach in the management of septic shock."
41376745,Clinical Outcome and Prognostication of Patients With Inflammatory and Immune Myopathies With and Without Chemotherapy in the United States.,2025,"Aim To compare the clinical outcome and in-hospital complication risk with chemotherapy and without chemotherapy in patients with inflammatory and immune myopathies (IIM). Methods We obtained data for IIM patients admitted to hospitals in the United States from 2017 to 2018 with a primary diagnosis of IIM using a large national database. We determined the rate and pattern of utilization of associated in-hospital outcomes of chemotherapy in this patient population. Results A total of 5,360 patients had IIM, of which 315 (5.8%) received chemotherapy for the underlying malignancies and 5,045 (94.2%) did not. No significant racial or gender discrepancies were observed between the two groups. Patients who received chemotherapy had more in-hospital complications, including sepsis [79 (25.1%) vs. 585 (11.6%), p<0.01] and acute kidney injury [75 (23.8%) vs. 665 (13.2%), p<0.01]. The number of deaths was higher in the chemotherapy group [125 (39.7%) vs. 190 (3.8%)]. Further analysis of patients who died in the chemotherapy group showed that myocardial infarction [20 (6.3%)] and pneumonia [45 (14.3%)] were the leading causes of death. Conclusion In hospitalization complications such as sepsis and acute kidney injury were higher in patients who received chemotherapy in IIM patients; however, patients who died had a higher risk of myocardial infarction and pneumonia, so routine cardiac and pulmonary evaluation should be done during hospitalization of this patient population."
41376421,[Generalised exanthema with abdominal sepsis].,2025,"We present the case of a 53-year-old patient who developed DRESS syndrome with hepatopathy and sepsis-like symptoms, including the need for vasoactive agents, while receiving antibiotic therapy. In this report, we show the diagnostic process from the initially suspected and frequent abdominal sepsis to the rare DRESS syndrome. Only after discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy and initiation of steroids did the condition gradually improve."
41376397,Utility of procalcitonin in diagnosing early postoperative sepsis after pediatric cardiac surgery in Malaysia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can interfere with analysis of routine clinical and biochemical parameters. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a potential biomarker for diagnosing early postoperative sepsis in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery utilizing CPB. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PCT compared to other biomarkers, especially C-reactive protein (CRP), in this clinical setting. METHODS: A prospective single-center study was conducted over a 10-month period during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2021-2022), enrolling 89 pediatric patients postcardiac surgery. PCT, CRP, and complete blood count were analyzed, and area under the curve (AUC) was employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: PCT and CRP demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability with AUCs of 0.678 and 0.635, respectively. White cell count exhibited fair discriminatory power, and platelet count performed poorly in distinguishing septic from nonseptic cases (AUC: white cell count, 0.545; platelet, 0.486). CONCLUSIONS: PCT and CRP hold promise as diagnostic markers for early postoperative sepsis in pediatric cardiac surgery patients. However, these biomarkers are not adequate standalone indicators, emphasizing the continued need for clinical judgment supported by multiple diagnostic parameters."
41375849,"Time to Decompression in Obstructive Urosepsis from Ureteral Calculi: Thresholds, Initial Diversion, and Early Biomarkers: A Systematic Review.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Obstructive urosepsis mandates rapid source control, yet actionable time-to-decompression (TTD) thresholds and the influence of diversion route remain debated. This review synthesized evidence on TTD, early outcomes, and predictive biomarkers. Methods: Following PRISMA-2020, ten studies met eligibility: three large administrative cohorts and seven clinical series/trials comparing outcomes by TTD and/or initial decompression (retrograde stent [RUS] vs. percutaneous nephrostomy [PCN]) and reporting biomarkers. Results: Delays were consistently harmful. In a national cohort, a TTD of >/= 2 days increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63). Another analysis showed mortality of 0.16% with </=48 h vs. 0.47% when delayed (derived OR, 0.43; p = 0.044). Absence of decompression yielded the highest mortality (19.2% vs. 8.82%; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.7). Septic shock remained frequent despite low crude mortality in clinical series: 20.8% and 33.3% across two cohorts. Post-decompression urosepsis occurred in 18.7% in a randomized study and was associated with pyonephrosis and higher procalcitonin (PCT). An ED cohort showed that earlier stenting reduced length of stay (</=6 h: 35.6 h vs. 71.6 h, p = 0.01; </=10 h: 45.7 h vs. 82.4 h, p = 0.04). Modality effects were modest; one cohort reported higher ICU use with PCN vs. RUS (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.24-8.41), likely reflecting confounding by indication. Conclusions: Across designs, timeliness-not device choice-was the dominant determinant of early outcomes. Biomarkers (notably, PCT) and imaging features can prioritize ultra-early decompression."
41374441,"Rapid Molecular Diagnostics for MDR Nosocomial Infections in ICUs: Integration with Prevention, Stewardship, and Novel Therapies.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial infections remain a major challenge in intensive care units (ICUs), where delays in diagnosis and suboptimal antimicrobial therapy significantly impact outcomes. This narrative review synthesizes international literature and local epidemiological data from Western Romania to examine the role of rapid molecular diagnostics in the management of MDR infections and their integration with prevention and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies. Methods: Evidence was collected through a narrative literature review using PubMed, WHO, and ECDC sources published between 2010 and 2025. Key terms included ""rapid molecular diagnostics,"" ""sepsis,"" ""ICU,"" ""UNYVERO,"" ""GeneXpert,"" ""BioFire,"" and ""carbapenem resistance."" Studies were selected based on clinical relevance to rapid diagnostics and MDR pathogens; no PRISMA-based systematic methodology was applied. Results: Diagnostic performance varies by platform and clinical syndrome. UNYVERO Hospitalized Pneumonia panel demonstrates a sensitivity range of 88.8-91.4% and specificity of 94.9-99.5% in respiratory infections, with a turnaround time of approximately 4-5 h. The GeneXpert Carba-R assay identifies major carbapenemases within 45-60 min with reported sensitivity 96-100% and specificity of 93-99%. BioFire((R)) Pneumonia and Blood Culture Identification panels similarly provide rapid syndromic results within 1 h, enabling earlier optimization of antimicrobial therapy. Local ICU data from Western Romania identified a substantial burden of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, underscoring the need for rapid resistance detection to guide therapy. Conclusions: Rapid molecular diagnostics, when integrated with prevention bundles and AMS programs, facilitate earlier targeted therapy, support responsible antimicrobial use, and improve clinical decision-making in MDR infections. Their value is amplified in settings with high resistance prevalence. Wider implementation, combined with surveillance and access to novel antimicrobials, is essential to improve outcomes in critically ill patients."
41374325,Next-Generation Sequencing for Bloodstream Infections: Shaping the Future of Rapid Diagnostics and Precision Medicine.,2025,"Bloodstream infections and sepsis necessitate rapid, sensitive, and clinically relevant diagnostics to minimize treatment delays and improve clinical outcomes. Next-generation sequencing enables culture-independent pathogen detection, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and genome-informed epidemiology. This narrative review integrates clinical evidence with practical workflows across three complementary approaches. We describe the use of plasma microbial cell-free DNA for broad organism detection and burden monitoring, as well as metagenomic next-generation sequencing of blood or plasma for unbiased pathogen discovery, including culture-negative and polymicrobial infections. Same-day Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing of positive blood culture broth is also discussed as a way to accelerate species identification, targeted resistance reporting, and infection-prevention decisions. We outline the sample-to-result steps, typical turnaround time (TAT), and stewardship-aligned decision points. Analytical reliability depends on effective reduction in human DNA background, stringent control of background and reagent-derived nucleic acids in low-biomass samples, and documented and validated bioinformatics workflows that are supported by curated taxonomic and resistance databases. Quantitative reports should adhere to validated thresholds and should be interpreted in the context of internal controls and clinical pretest probability. Ongoing challenges include variable correlation between genotype and phenotype for specific pathogen and antibiotic pairs, interpretation of low-level signals, and inconsistent regulatory and reimbursement environments. Advances in portable sequencing, faster laboratory and analytical workflows, and scaled liquid biopsy strategies may further reduce the TAT and expand access. Integrating these tools within One Health frameworks and global genomic surveillance programs could support early resistance detection and coordinated public health action, which could help to advance sepsis care toward more precise treatment and real-time infection control insights."
41373794,Fatal Myocarditis Following Adjuvant Immunotherapy: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2025,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by enhancing the immune response against tumors. However, they can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including rare but potentially fatal myocarditis. We describe a 71-year-old man with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab who developed severe ICI-associated myocarditis. Despite early diagnosis, treatment with intensive immunosuppression and mechanical support, he suffered fatal cardiac complications. A systematic review of the literature up to May 2025 identified 44 cases of ICI-associated myocarditis. Data on clinical features, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Most cases involved older patients with lung cancer treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Onset varied from days to years after therapy initiation. Presentations included dyspnea, chest pain, arrhythmias, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The biopsy showed T-cell and macrophage infiltration. High-dose corticosteroids were the primary treatment; additional immunosuppressants were used in cases that were refractory. Mortality was 45%, mainly due to cardiac failure and sepsis. Discussion: ICI-associated myocarditis arises from immune dysregulation affecting cardiac tissue, potentially involving shared antigens and systemic inflammation. Early detection and aggressive immunosuppression are crucial but often insufficient, resulting in high mortality. This underscores the urgent need for a better understanding of pathogenesis and the development of effective management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Finally, a multidisciplinary approach is important to improve outcomes in ICI-associated myocarditis."
41373107,Rare and Tricky: The Relationship Between Hospital Trauma Volume and Delay in Surgical Intervention in Blunt Intestinal Injury.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of hospital blunt intestinal injury (BInI) trauma volume on time to surgery in patients with BInI. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The diagnosis of BInI is challenging, even for trauma experts, leading to frequent delays in necessary surgical intervention. METHODS: The 2017-2020 ACS-TQIP database was used to identify patients >/=18 years with full-thickness ileal, jejunal, or colonic perforation secondary to blunt trauma. Hospitals were stratified by the annual volume of BInI. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and injury characteristics/severity was used to study the impact of hospital trauma volume on delayed surgery (>24 hours) and outcomes (e.g. mortality, sepsis). Sensitivity analyses were performed classifying hospitals by their volume of (1) blunt trauma and (2) all trauma admissions. RESULTS: Out of a total of 4,005,762 trauma patients, 3,954 were included: 1,397 (35.3%) in low BInI volume, 1,373 (34.7%) in medium BInI volume, and 1,184 (30%) in high BInI volume hospitals. The mean time to surgery was 18+/-46 hours in low-volume compared to 15+/-45 hours in high-volume hospitals (P<0.001). On multivariable analysis, high BInI volume was independently associated with early surgery (aOR for delayed surgery 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.88) and a 42% lower risk of post-injury sepsis (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91) compared to low BInI volume. High blunt trauma and all trauma hospital volumes were similarly associated with early surgery (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.84; aOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High trauma hospital volume is independently associated with prompt surgical intervention and improved outcomes in patients with BInI. These findings highlight the importance of clinical trauma experience and available resources for trauma care in early diagnosis and management of the rare and tricky intestinal injuries."
41373009,Machine learning predicts non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Non-thyroid disease syndrome (NTIS) occurs in various serious illnesses, with sepsis being a common cause. Early identification of NTIS risk in sepsis patients is crucial. This study aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models for the NTIS occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 963 recruited sepsis patients, and 890 of them were retained for NTIS occurrence prediction after data selection and processing, while 797 NTIS patients were selected for mortality prediction. LASSO regression and correlation analysis identified key clinical features. We evaluated the predictive capacity on both occurrence and mortality of eight machine learning algorithms using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Sensitivity and Specificity. For mortality prediction, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors and construct a nomogram model, which was further validated by decision curve and survival analyses. RESULTS: XGBoost performed best in NTIS occurrence prediction, while LASSO showed the highest efficiency for mortality prediction. Lower levels of T3, FT3, T4, and KAP/LAM were associated with higher NTIS risk. Mechanical ventilation, norepinephrine, abdominal infection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation with sudden cardiac arrest, multiple organ failure, novel coronavirus infection, and gender were associated with NTIS mortality. Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox regression underscored age, mechanical ventilation, pulmonary infection, multiple organ failure, norepinephrine, UA, and FIB as independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: XGBoost and LASSO models showed promising performance in predicting NTIS occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients, respectively, and integrating them with clinical risk factors may improve risk stratification and support clinical decision-making. However, the findings are derived from a single-center dataset, and the use of data imputation to address missing values may introduce model instability, warranting cautious interpretation and external validation."
41372998,MiR-143-5p serves as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with sepsis and regulates sepsis-induced inflammation and cardiac dysfunction.,2025,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) offer advantages in stability and therapeutic specificity. This study investigated the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of miR-143-5p in sepsis (SP) and SP-associated cardiac dysfunction (CD). ‌Methods. Quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) quantified serum and cellular miR-143-5p levels. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve evaluated miR-143-5p's diagnostic efficacy. Pearson correlation analysis assessed the association between miR-143-5p and SP. Univariate logistic regression identified CD risk factors, with multivariate logistic analysis including significant variables from univariate analysis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage (THP-1) and cardiomyocyte (AC16) models elucidated miR-143-5p mechanisms in SP, with bioinformatics predicting the potential pathways. ‌Results. MiR-143-5p downregulation demonstrated diagnostic value for SP (AUC: 0.897) and SP-CD (AUC: 0.812). MiR-143-5p expression correlated (P < 0.0001) with white blood cell count (WBC, r = -0.680), C-reactive protein (CRP, r = -0.563), procalcitonin (PCT, r = - 0.693), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, r = 0.640), cardiac troponin I (cTnI, r = -0.599), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II, r = -0.695), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA, P < 0.05) scores. MiR-143-5p served as a risk factor for CD in SP (OR: 0.100). MiR-143-5p overexpression reduced M1 polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated THP-1. In AC16 cardiomyocytes, it enhanced viability, suppressed apoptosis, and attenuated inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis indicated miR-143-5p was involved in p53 and MAPK signal pathways regulation. ‌Conclusions. MiR-143-5p downregulation showed diagnostic potential for SP and SP with CD, correlating with disease severity and CD risk. Mechanistically, miR-143-5p overexpression mitigated macrophage and cardiomyocyte injury."
41372900,Sepsis mortality prediction using machine learning and deep learning - a systematic review.,2025,"Sepsis, a critical infection-induced inflammatory condition, poses substantial global health challenges, demanding timely detection for effective intervention. This article explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in predicting sepsis using electronic health record (EHR) to enhance patient outcomes. A comprehensive search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus yielded 39 studies meeting stringent inclusion criteria. Predominantly retrospective (n = 34) and geographically diverse, these studies, spanning North America (n=19), Asia (n=13), Europe (n=6), and Australia (n=1), exhibited varied datasets, sepsis definitions, and prevalence rates, necessitating data augmentation strategies. Heterogeneous parameter usage, diverse model distribution, and inconsistent quality assessments were identified. Despite differences, longitudinal data showcased the potential of early sepsis prediction. The review outlines the challenges posed by disparate funding and article quality correlation, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation metrics. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the promising role of ML/DL methodologies in sepsis detection and early prediction through EHR, underscoring the imperative for standardized approaches and comprehensive quality assessments."
41372428,Trajectory of serum osmolality changes and 28-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis-associated delirium based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"Serum osmolality (SOSM) levels have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of the trajectory of changes in SOSM on the 28-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis-associated delirium (SAD). Latent class trajectory modeling (LCTM) was employed in this retrospective cohort study of patients with SAD from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. SOSM trajectories were derived using LCTM based on three measurements obtained at two-day intervals during the first six days following ICU admission. The relationship between the SOSM and 28-day mortality risk was explored using restricted cubic spline (RCS), Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the association and stability of SOSM trajectories with SAD patients' outcome. Among the 3100 SAD patients included in the analysis, 488 (15.7%) died within 28 days. The median SOSM level was 294.8 (IQR 288.1-302.0) mmol/L. LCTM identified four distinct SOSM trajectories: normal-level-steady trend trajectory (Class 1), normal-level-increasing trend trajectory (Class 2), normal-level-decreasing and then increasing trend trajectory (Class 3), and normal-level-increasing and then decreasing trend trajectory (Class 4). Elevated baseline SOSM levels were independently associated with higher 28-day mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03). RCS revealed a positive linear association between baseline SOSM levels and 28-day mortality risk (P overall < 0.001; P non-linearity = 0.87). Compared with Class 1, patients in Class 2 (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.31-2.01), Class 3 (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.19-2.47), and Class 4 (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.39-2.84) exhibited significantly increased 28-day mortality risk. Subgroup analyses further demonstrated that the trajectory 2 was consistently associated with 28-day mortality in SAD patients aged over 60 years. SOSM was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in patients with SAD. Persistent elevation and fluctuation of SOSM trajectories after ICU admission were associated with increased 28-day mortality in patients with SAD."
41370337,Protective Effects of TRPV1 Agonist Capsaicin in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Rats.,2025,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels have been shown to be present in many tissues, including the kidney. Previous studies have reported that TRPV1 activation has anti-inflammatory and renoprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPV1 agonist capsaicin on acute kidney injury (AKI) in a rat sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Rats were divided into control, CLP and treatment groups in which 3 different doses of capsaicin (2, 6 and 30 mg/kg) were administered with CLP administration. Kidney tissues and sera from animals 24 h after CLP were analyzed. Histopathological examinations have shown that kidney damage occurs due to sepsis. TLR4/NF-kappaB activity, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), caspase-3, caspase-8 and malondialdehyde levels increased in renal tissue due to sepsis. Serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and renal damage biomarkers (BUN, CRE, IL-18 and NGAL) increased due to sepsis. Capsaicin administration dose-dependently reversed sepsis-induced pathological changes in the kidney and serum. Our findings suggest that the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin has renoprotective effects in sepsis-induced AKI by reducing inflammation, oxidative damage and apoptosis. TRPV1 activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate sepsis-induced kidney and other organ damage."
41369873,Prognostic Significance of Immune Abnormalities in Children with Severe Sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte subsets in children with severe sepsis at admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and correlate them to mortality. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 52 children with severe sepsis/septic shock. Serum immunoglobulins and lymphocyte subsets were measured at diagnosis in all patients and after 3 mo in survivors. Regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 5 (3-7.5) y, with 62% boys. The median (IQR) time to hospital admission was 7 (4-10) d. Common diagnoses were acute meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, and tropical fever. At admission, the most common immune abnormality was low Natural killer (NK)-cell count (92%), followed by low T-cells (40%) and B-cells (36%). Among immunoglobulins, elevated IgM (27%) was most frequent, while low IgG (17%) and IgA (13%) were seen in a smaller subset. In this cohort, 19 (37%) children died due to severe sepsis. Low IgG was an independent predictor of mortality (OR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.22-6.28; p = 0.014), irrespective of other immune abnormalities, time to presentation, gender, age at presentation, and illness severity score. At 3-mo follow-up, immune parameters normalized in most survivors, though some showed persistent lymphopenia (mostly low NK-cells), though all were clinically well. CONCLUSIONS: Low NK-cells, elevated IgM, and low T-/B-cells were common at admission in children with severe sepsis. Low IgG was an independent predictor of mortality. Most immune abnormalities were reversible at 3-mo follow-up."
41369792,Two-year outcomes of the primary latarjet procedure: a nationwide analysis of 2258 patients.,2025,"PURPOSE: The Latarjet procedure effectively restores glenohumeral stability, particularly in patients with anterior shoulder instability and glenoid bone loss. However, existing outcome data are primarily derived from single-center studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of the Latarjet procedure in a nationwide population. METHODS: TriNetX, a global federated research network, was retrospectively queried to identify patients undergoing primary Latarjet. Patients that underwent prior capsulorrhaphy were excluded. The patient cohorts were evaluated for demographic factors, including age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Postoperative outcomes were assessed in the 30, 90, 180 days, and two years. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of sex on complication rates and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: A total of 2,258 patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort was predominately male (81%), with a mean age of 34 +/- 12 years and a mean BMI of 26 +/- 6 kg/m(2). Over the short and mid-term follow-up periods, complications such as SSI, DVT, sepsis, hematoma, and myocardial infarction remained uncommon (less than 2%). By two years, the rate of emergency department (ED) visits nearly doubled to 14%, yet serious adverse events and revision surgeries (3.6%) remained rare. Men and women exhibited similar overall complication profiles, with no significant sex-based differences in most outcomes. However, women were more likely than men to utilize the ED (23% vs. 15%; OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.454-0.869; p = 0.0043). CONCLUSION: The Latarjet procedure demonstrated low rats of both short- and long-term complications. While ED visits and complications such as shoulder dislocation increased over time, overall postoperative risk remained low. Complications were similar between men and women at two-year follow-up, with both groups experiencing low rates of serious adverse events. However, women's higher rates of emergency department visits warrant further investigation. These findings support the long-term safety and efficacy of the Latarjet procedure in a large, nationally representative cohort. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III."
41369115,From glycemic variability to digital signal biomarker: a prognostic and precision medicine framework for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"Sepsis, a condition with substantial global morbidity and mortality, frequently leads to sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). While glycemic variability (GV) correlates with adverse outcomes in critically ill populations, its prognostic value in SA-AKI remains underexplored. Using the MIMIC-IV database, this large-scale machine learning cohort study examined SA-AKI patients. Restricted cubic spline, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between GV, measured by glycemic coefficient of variation (CV) and 28- and 90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, and diabetes status were performed. Prognostic models were developed using Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random survival forests (RSF). Among 12,268 eligible SA-AKI patients, the Boruta algorithm identified glycemic CV as a key prognostic determinant. When stratified by CV quartiles, higher CV quartiles exhibited significantly increased 28-day and 90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses revealed consistent associations except in diabetic patients, where increases in CV showed no correlation with mortality. Machine learning models exhibited strong predictive performance, with 28-day area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.822 (CoxPH), 0.822 (LASSO), and 0.845 (RSF), and 90-day AUCs of 0.819 (CoxPH), 0.820 (LASSO), and 0.837 (RSF). Elevated GV is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality in SA-AKI. Beyond prognostication, these findings position GV as a real-time, modifiable digital biomarker that may underpin a mechanistic Glycemic Oscillation-Induced Renal Injury (GO-RI) Axis. This framework supports future development of machine learning-enabled precision ICU nephrology strategies for dynamic risk stratification and phenotype-specific glycemic modulation in SA-AKI."
41369096,Cytokine release syndrome complicated with sepsis induced by tislelizumab in a patient with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A case report.,2025,"In this study, we report a 69-year-old female patient with stage IIIB hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed sepsis concomitant with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following treatment with tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) and subsequently demonstrated self-healing. After receiving tislelizumab-based immunotherapy, the patient presented with severe clinical manifestations, including fever, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS); however, after multidisciplinary evaluation regarding the potential risks of immunosuppression, immunosuppressive agents such as tocilizumab or corticosteroids were not applied, and the patient still experienced a good recovery through routine anti-infective therapy and aggressive supportive care. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity in distinguishing CRS from sepsis during anti-tumor immunotherapy and demonstrates that immunomodulatory therapy may not be mandatory in all patients. Collectively, the favorable outcomes achieved without tocilizumab or corticosteroids suggest that selected patients can recover through meticulous clinical monitoring and targeted interventions alone, thus highlighting the clinical importance of selecting patients who can be spared from immunosuppressive therapy."
41369086,"[Post-acute infection syndromes: time for recognition, understanding, and targeted care].",2025,"Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS) are conditions characterized by persistent symptoms following an infectious disease. Although these syndromes share similarities in symptom burden and impact on daily functioning, they vary significantly in aetiology, clinical course, and treatment options. Postcovid is currently the most recognized example, but the phenomenon is not new: prolonged symptoms have also been observed after infections with Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Coxiella burnetii, poliovirus, and after sepsis. The increasing attention to PAIS raises key questions in clinical practice: When do residual symptoms constitute a distinct syndrome? What do we know about underlying mechanisms and treatment strategies? How can we adequately diagnose and support patients? And what role does the biopsychosocial model play in understanding and managing these complaints? In this Discussion article, we review recent scientific findings and offer a perspective on these discussion points, with the aim of improving recognition, insight, and patient-centred care in PAIS."
41368952,Management of anastomotic leak after elective anterior resection for rectal cancer: A systematic review and pooled analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak (AL) following rectal cancer resection significantly increases the clinical care, risks morbidity and mortality and impairs oncological outcomes. AL management is not standardised. This systematic review and pooled analysis evaluated the comparative efficacy of the various reported strategies. METHOD: After protocol generation with AMSTAR2, a systematic search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Primary and secondary outcome measures were pooled using the DerSimonian-Laird method with 95% confidence intervals, I(2) statistics for heterogeneity and Egger and Begg's testing for bias, defining success as resolution of pelvic sepsis and/or healing of AL. RESULTS: Sixteen studies published between 2010 and 2024 comprising 7236 patients, 850 with AL, met eligibility criteria albeit with significant heterogeneity (I(2) > 50%), reporting variability and moderate bias. Overall, success rates with conservative management (CM) was 44.4%, drainage procedures (DP) 73.7% (78.7% for passive drainage and 73.5% for active drainage), anastomosis conserving surgery (ACS) 69.7% and anastomotic takedown (SAT) 77.0%. Short-term mortality was CM: 0%, DP: 0.97%, ACS: 2.92% and SAT: 1.49%. Mean length of stay was CM: 28.7 days, DP: 59.9 days, ACS: 19.8 days and SAT: 14.7 days. Further intervention occurred in CM: 55.6%, DP: 29.1%, ACS: 53.3% and SAT: 41.1%. Long-term stoma rates were CM: 33.3%, DP: 22.5%, ACS: 27.6% and SAT: 46.0%. CONCLUSION: Drainage techniques demonstrate high success with low mortality and further intervention rate albeit with lengthened hospital stay. Surgical approaches also achieve success although mortality and long-term stoma rates are higher. Future studies need a core outcome set."
41368629,DAMP-driven trained immunity: metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in critical illness and chronic inflammation.,2025,"Innate immune memory, traditionally underappreciated in contrast to adaptive immunity, is now recognized as a critical component of host defense, particularly in the context of sepsis and sterile inflammatory injury. Recent advances have identified a central role for metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in driving trained immunity (TRIM), where monocytes, macrophages, and other innate cells develop enhanced or tolerized responses to secondary stimuli. This review synthesizes current knowledge of how damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including oxidized LDL, HMGB1, heme, urate crystals, and mitochondrial DNA, serve as potent inducers of immunometabolic rewiring, often through the mTOR/HIF-1alpha axis or alternative pathways such as SYK signaling. We highlight distinct epigenetic mechanisms, such as enhancer priming via H3K4me1/H3K27ac, and metabolic shifts like the Warburg effect, succinate accumulation, and fatty acid synthesis, that define the trained or tolerized states. Particular attention is given to the relevance of these mechanisms in the pathophysiology of sepsis, burns, trauma, and other critical illnesses where persistent DAMP exposure may sustain maladaptive inflammation or immunosuppression. We review data linking central (stem cell-level) and peripheral reprogramming to long-term immune dysfunction in various inflammatory disease models, and explore how DAMPs intersect with PAMPs to shape the immune trajectory. Finally, we identify pressing gaps in the field, including the need for standardized TRIM models, validated biomarkers of innate memory, and mechanistic clarity on mitochondrial DAMPs in immune tolerance. These insights provide a foundation for future therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating trained immunity to improve outcomes in critically ill patients."
41368478,A Case of Postoperative Sepsis Triggered by Fecal Retention at the Suture Site After Appendectomy.,2025,"Postoperative sepsis after appendectomy can sometimes be led by surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, or intestinal obstruction. However, there have been no reports that postoperative sepsis is certainly caused by only fecal retention in the intestine, including the appendectomy stump. A 60-year-old healthy woman visited a doctor with a chief complaint of right lower abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a swollen appendix with fecal calculus, and then the patient was diagnosed with acute appendicitis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy the next day. The appendix was resected at the level of the appendicular root with an endostapler. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day (POD) 4 in a good general condition. However, the patient visited the hospital on POD 15 with a chief complaint of fever. A medical interview revealed a decrease in the number of bowel movements compared to before the appendectomy. The quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score with the vital signs showed two points, and the SOFA score with the blood examination showed a total increase of four points compared to the previous blood examination. The patient was therefore suspected of sepsis after appendectomy. Abdominal CT showed obvious fecal retention in the ileocecal region, including the appendectomy site. Furthermore, abdominal contrast CT did not reveal any obvious thrombosis in the portal venous system. With conservative treatment by antibiotics and laxatives, the fever gradually resolved, and the patient was discharged on POD 27. Abdominal radiography showed no findings of fecal retention. The patient has had regular bowel movements and has not experienced a recurrence of the symptoms. Postoperative sepsis might be caused even in healthy patients. It was conceivable that postoperative assessment of bowel movements was necessary to detect the risk of postoperative sepsis."
41368460,Initial Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-platelet Ratio Index is Associated with Sepsis-associated Liver Dysfunction in Adult Patients with Sepsis: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) represents a prevalent and critical complication frequently observed in patients with sepsis. The association between the initial aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) and SALD is unclear in adult patients diagnosed with sepsis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction was defined as an elevated serum aminotransaminase (>800 IU/L) or total bilirubin (>2 mg/dL) level. Multivariate and smoothing curve analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the APRI [APRI = (AST (IU/L)/upper limits of normal)/PLT (k/uL)x100] and SALD. Subgroup analysis was additionally conducted to assess the robustness of the finding. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to evaluate the discriminatory ability of SALD. External validation was performed using our own dataset. RESULTS: Overall, 6,334 sepsis patients (SALD, n = 985; no-SALD, n = 5,349) were included. Initial APRI was positively associated with SALD occurrence after controlling for potential confounding variables [odds ratio (OR) = 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.20; p < 0.001]. A nonlinear dose-dependent relationship was found between initial APRI and SALD (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant interaction between initial APRI and each subgroup divided by age, sex, albumin level, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (p > 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for APRI was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.752-0.786), and the optimal cutoff was 0.95. External validation also exhibited good consistency (AUC: 0.761; 95% CI: 0.680-0.842). CONCLUSION: A high initial APRI was linked to an elevated risk of developing SALD in adult patients with sepsis, as shown by the non-linear dose-dependent relationship. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Initial APRI is an easy and accessible tool that can be adopted for timely detection of the risk of SALD and prompt initiation of interventions for adult patients with sepsis.

41368432,An interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of Escherichia coli infection in ICU patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early and accurate identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients remains challenging butmay improve clinical outcomes if addressed effectively. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of E. coli infection at ICU admission. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Adult patients (aged 18-100 years) with their first ICU admission and a length of stay >/=24 hours were included. E. coli infection was identified based on microbiological results and diagnostic codes. Missing data were imputed using the missForest algorithm. Feature selection was performed with Boruta and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and intersecting variables were used for model construction. Eight machine learning models, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network, were developed. Model performance in the validation cohort was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC). Model interpretability was evaluated with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: A total of 52, 554 ICU patients were analyzed, of whom 4, 157 (7.9%) had E. coli infection. Twenty-eight intersecting variables were selected for modeling. Among all models, the SVM achieved the highest discrimination (AUC = 0.745, 95% CI: 0.726-0.764), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.742) and extreme gradient boosting (AUC = 0.739). Calibration and decision analyses indicated robust model calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified gender, age, sepsis, sedative use, and potassium level as the most influential predictors. A web-based tool was developed to enable real-time clinical risk estimation and individualized interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: An interpretable SVM-based machine learning model was developed and validated for early prediction of E. coli infection in ICU patients, demonstrating good discrimination, calibration, and potential clinical benefit. The associated online tool provides transparent, individualized risk predictions and may facilitate timely clinical decision-making."
41368268,Spontaneous ureteral rupture during pregnancy: a case report and literature review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous ureteral rupture is a rare and emergent urological entity, with limited literature guiding its diagnosis and management. Its non-specific presentation can lead to delayed recognition, posing risks of severe complications such as urinoma, sepsis, and renal failure. Currently, there is limited experience regarding the diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous ureteral rupture during pregnancy. Herein, we present a case to illustrate effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for managing this rare but potentially life-threatening condition. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 38-year-old woman at 25 weeks' gestation who presented with acute left flank pain and nausea. Initial ultrasonography revealed bilateral hydronephrosis without evidence of urolithiasis. Non-contrast magnetic resonance urography (MRU) confirmed discontinuity of the left upper ureter wall and perirenal fluid collection. Given the significant urinary extravasation and concerns about retrograde access, percutaneous nephrostomy was performed to prevent infection and preserve renal function. She remained stable throughout pregnancy and underwent an elective cesarean section at 35 weeks. Postpartum antegrade urography at 8 weeks demonstrated a patent ureter, and the nephrostomy tube was subsequently removed without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider spontaneous ureteral rupture as a differential diagnosis of abdominal pain during pregnancy, even in the absence of calculi. Repeated ultrasonography and MRU are safe and effective imaging modalities for diagnosis of spontaneous ureteral rupture in pregnant patients. Percutaneous nephrostomy can serve as a viable, effective and minimally invasive strategy that protects renal function and ensures maternal-fetal safety."
41368240,The prognostic value of the neutrophil‑to‑platelet ratio for predicting postoperative sepsis complications after ureteroscopic lithotripsy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality following ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). Current diagnostic criteria, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, are effective for identifying established sepsis but often fail to provide early warning before clinical deterioration. This creates a critical need for readily available predictive biomarkers. Given that a rise in neutrophils and a fall in platelets are central to sepsis pathophysiology, neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR) represents a promising candidate for early risk stratification. This study aimed to evaluate the NPR for the early prediction of postoperative sepsis following URSL. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 674 patients undergoing URSL (January-December 2024). After screening, 385 patients were included and classified into sepsis (n=40) and control (n=345) groups based on postoperative urine culture and SOFA score. Biomarkers measured 3-hour postoperatively were analyzed using logistic regression. Diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified NPR, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and female gender as independent predictors of sepsis. Among these, NPR demonstrated the strongest association. The sepsis group exhibited a significantly higher NPR (0.081+/-0.051 vs. 0.020+/-0.013, P<0.01). NPR showed robust diagnostic efficacy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.838-0.955], sensitivity of 80.0%, and specificity of 88.4% at an optimal threshold of >2.77x10(-2). CONCLUSIONS: The NPR, obtained from a routine blood count 3-hour after URSL, is a strong independent predictor of subsequent sepsis, showing high diagnostic accuracy. These findings highlight its potential clinical utility for early risk stratification, pending validation in prospective multicenter cohorts."
41368117,Hypertransaminasemia in non-cirrhotic critically-ill patients.,2025,"Hypertransaminasemia - acute elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase - is prevalent in non-cirrhotic adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and often signals extra-hepatic pathophysiology rather than intrinsic liver disease. To synthesise contemporary evidence on aetiology-driven diagnosis, management and emerging biomarkers of hypertransaminasemia in critically ill patients. We performed a structured search of PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL (January 2010-June 2025). The search was restricted to full-text articles that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Hypoxic liver injury is the leading cause of hypertransaminasemia in non-cirrhotic ICU patients and is characterized by a >/= 50% alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase fall within 72 hours after haemodynamic stabilisation. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury remains uncommon yet explains about 13% of acute liver-failure cases in Western registries. Sepsis-associated liver injury presents mainly as conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with modest transaminase rise, whereas parenteral-nutrition-associated liver disease is dominated by cholestasis after > 2 weeks of parenteral feeding. Early optimisation of macro-/micro-circulation, rational deprescribing of hepatotoxins, rapid source control of infection and prompt transition to enteral nutrition are outcome-modifying interventions across all phenotypes. In the ICU, aminotransferase elevation should be interpreted as a dynamic biomarker of systemic distress. A pattern-recognition algorithm integrating clinical context, enzyme kinetics and novel biomarkers (glutamate dehydrogenase, microRNA-122, high-mobility group box-1) can expedite aetiology-specific therapy and deserves prospective validation."
41367529,Early predictive value of interleukin-6 and procalcitonin levels for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic respiratory complication in preterm infants. With the advancement of medical technology, the survival rate of many preterm infants with low gestational age (GA) has increased year by year, accompanied by a rising incidence of BPD. Currently, the pathogenesis of BPD is not fully understood, and there are no specific treatment methods. It is particularly important to make early predictions and take preventive measures for BPD. This study aimed to evaluate the early predictive value of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels for BPD in preterm infants. METHODS: In total, 114 preterm infants with GA <32 weeks were enrolled. Infants who met the diagnostic criteria for BPD were assigned to the BPD group (n=57), whereas those who did not meet the criteria formed the non-BPD group (n=57). The BPD group was further categorized based on severity: mild, moderate, and severe. General conditions, comorbidities, complications, treatment outcomes, and maternal data were compared between groups. Serum IL-6 and PCT levels were measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after birth. Multifactorial regression analysis was conducted to investigate postnatal risk factors, and a logistic regression model incorporating clinical factors and biomarkers was developed to predict BPD. RESULTS: Among the 57 infants with BPD, 32, 22, and 3 had mild, moderate, and severe BPD, respectively. Invasive ventilation >7 days and late-onset sepsis (LOS) were significant risk factors for BPD (P<0.05). Serum IL-6 and PCT levels were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on days 1 and 3 (P<0.05). The levels were also higher in the moderate/severe BPD groups than in the mild group (P<0.05). The area under the curve for IL-6 and PCT levels was higher on day 1 than on day 3. Moreover, the serum IL-6 levels were positively correlated with serum PCT levels in the BPD group on days 1 and 3. A BPD prediction model was constructed using four indicators (invasive ventilation >7 days, LOS, IL-6 and PCT on day 1), showing significant predictive value (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive model combining serum IL-6 and PCT levels with independent clinical risk factors could enable early BPD prediction."
41367440,Distinguishing Intraventricular Hemorrhage From Infectious Etiologies in Febrile Late Preterm Neonates: Case Studies in Antibiotic Stewardship.,2025,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a well-recognized complication in preterm infants, but its presentation as fever can be easily overlooked, leading to extensive sepsis workups and delayed diagnosis. This case report presents two late preterm infants who developed fever as the primary presenting symptom of IVH. Distinguishing IVH-related fever from that due to infectious causes can be challenging in this vulnerable population, where overuse of antimicrobials carries significant risks, including altered microbiome development, necrotizing enterocolitis, and antimicrobial resistance. Incorporating early diagnostic evaluation for IVH through cranial ultrasound in late preterm infants presenting with unexplained fever may avoid unnecessary tests and promote judicious antimicrobial use while improving overall neonatal outcomes."
41367239,Identification of novel PTP1B inhibitor for the treatment of LPS-induced myocardial apoptosis: machine learning based virtual screening and biological evaluation.,2025,"Sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction (SICD) poses a serious threat to human life. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) displays an essential role in SICD occurrence, so discovering novel inhibitors targeting PTP1B is an effective strategy for SICD treatment. In this research, we exploited a novel virtual screening pipeline consisting of both ligand-based and structure-based modules to find novel PTP1B inhibitors, and compound PI-2 with IC(50) = 4.1 +/- 0.3 muM was successfully discovered. Enzymatic and cellular thermal shift assay showed PI-2 displayed a moderate PTP1B inhibitory activity and a good selectivity towards both PTP1B and TCPTP. Besides, PI-2 effectively protected Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced AC16 injury by reducing cell ROS levels and enhancing mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, this research not only provides a novel virtual screening strategy for discovering novel PTP1B inhibitors, but also supplies a potential candidate for further optimisation for the treatment of SICD."
41367001,Sepsis after the Altemeier procedure: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Anastomotic leakage represents the most critical complication following the Altemeier procedure. However, sepsis resulting from anastomotic leakage has been rarely reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rectal prolapse underwent the Altemeier procedure. On postoperative day 4, he developed sepsis secondary to anastomotic leakage. DIAGNOSES: The patient's condition deteriorated after the Altemeier procedure, presenting with sepsis, anastomotic leakage, presacral infection, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. INTERVENTIONS: Terminal ileostomy was performed, and a self-designed double-lumen irrigation-drainage catheter was placed at the anal anastomotic site for irrigation and drainage to control the source of infection. Concurrent intravenous antimicrobial therapy with meropenem and levofloxacin was administered. OUTCOMES: 22 days after the terminal ileostomy procedure, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels normalized, and the patient was discharged. At the 4-month follow-up, colonoscopy revealed complete healing of the anastomosis, and successful ileostomy reversal surgery was subsequently performed. LESSONS: For patients with rectal prolapse who have other comorbid infections or malnutrition, thorough preoperative assessment before the Altemeier procedure is crucial for preventing severe anastomotic leakage."
41366996,Sepsis secondary to postoperative Enterococcus gallinarum infection in a patient with rectal cancer: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Enterococcus gallinarum, while of relatively low virulence, is an emerging multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen. This case report aims to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by this organism, particularly in immunocompromised hosts following major surgery, and to emphasize the importance of early microbiological identification and targeted therapy in such scenarios. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 1-month history of recurrent abdominal pain and bloating. She underwent surgical intervention and subsequently developed septic shock. Despite empiric therapy with imipenem-cilastatin (1000 mg every 8 hours) plus vancomycin (1000 mg every 12 hours), her condition deteriorated, presenting with persistent fever and progressive multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. DIAGNOSES: Enterococcus gallinarum (Group D), intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, was isolated from the wound secretion culture. INTERVENTIONS: According to the culture results, antibiotic therapy was adjusted to levofloxacin (300 mg once daily) plus meropenem (1000 mg every 8 hours). OUTCOMES: After the adjustment of antibiotics, the patient's body temperature normalized within days. Following 1 week of targeted antibiotic therapy, all infection markers (including white blood cell count and procalcitonin) normalized. The antibiotic regimen was successfully de-escalated, and the patient was discharged after full clinical recovery. LESSONS: The diagnosis and management of sepsis due to postoperative E gallinarum infection should focus on preventing and controlling postoperative complications, performing early etiological cultures, and selecting appropriate antibiotics."
41366789,NUFIP1 at the crossroads of ribophagy and disease: unveiling therapeutic implications.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Nuclear FMR1-interacting protein 1 (NUFIP1), originally identified as a binding partner of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), has increasingly been recognized as a pivotal factor in various pathological processes. Its recently elucidated role as a receptor in ribophagy positions it at the intersection of critical cellular pathways, suggesting broad functional significance in human disease pathogenesis. This review synthesizes emerging evidence underscoring the multifaceted involvement of NUFIP1 in key physiological and pathological mechanisms. It regulates fundamental processes such as tumor metabolism, immune responses during sepsis, and recovery from neural injury. Notably, recent findings indicate that impaired NUFIP1 function, particularly within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, can be exacerbated by external factors like low-protein diets, leading to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and the promotion of necroptosis. This compilation critically evaluates the mechanistic contributions of NUFIP1 across these diverse disease contexts and assesses its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker. SHORT CONCLUSION: In conclusion, NUFIP1 emerges as a critical molecular player with widespread implications for human health. A comprehensive understanding of its functions provides valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review consolidates the current knowledge on NUFIP1, highlights its clinical relevance, and identifies promising avenues for future research to fully delineate its therapeutic potential."
41366739,Influence of heart rate trajectory in 30-day mortality in sepsis patients: a retrospective study based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Heart rate is one of the important vital signs. Many studies have done a lot of meaningful research on heart rate in sepsis patients. However, the heart rates of sepsis patients were repeatedly measured after their admission to intensive care unit (ICU). The trajectory of these changes was observed, but the impact of this trajectory on the short-term mortality prognosis for sepsis remains unclear. This study was performed to investigate impact of repeated changes in heart rate on short-term all-cause mortality among sepsis patients was assessed. METHOD: In this retrospective study of data on sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database, the outcome was short-term mortality. The measured heart rate of sepsis patients 10 h post-admission to ICU was extracted, with 1 h between each measurement. Latent growth mixture modelling (LGMM) was used to classify heart rate trajectories, while Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to analyze differences in survival between groups. RESULT: This study enrolled 5511 sepsis patients, and six different heart rate trajectories were identified based on model-fit criteria. Class 1: heart rate stable at 80 bpm; class 2: consistently 92 bpm; class 3: briefly stable, then declining; class 4: steady at 110 bpm; class 5: fluctuating around 65 bpm; class 6: stable at 128 bpm. The K-M analysis indicated sepsis patients in class1 had the highest survival probability, and the class3 had the lowest survival probability. After adjusting for all potential confounding factors, the Cox proportional hazard model showed that compared with class 1, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for classes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were 1.28 (1.09, 1.50), 1.88 (1.38, 2.56), 1.49 (1.26, 1.76), 1.24 (1.03, 1.48), and 1.30 (1.02, 1.66), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining a sustained heart rate of approximately 80 beats per minute during the initial 10-hour period post-ICU admission may be associated with improved short-term outcomes in patients with sepsis."
41366523,Kinetics of molecular patterns captured by mannose-binding lectin in septic shock correlate with clinical outcome: a monocentric prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Various serum biomarkers and scoring systems are currently employed to manage septic critically ill patients. However, a paucity of biomarker evidence facilitates sepsis identification or prognosis. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is the main circulating protein in innate immunity. It acts as a broad-spectrum recognition molecule that binds most pathogens, along with their breakdown products and cell debris. We report results of an original approach dosing molecular patterns captured by FcMBL, an engineered version of MBL, in patients with septic shock. This study aimed at evaluating molecular patterns kinetics to assess their potential contribution to the clinical management of critically ill patients suffering from septic shock. RESULTS: This monocentric, prospective, observational study was conducted on adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock. Using magnetic microbeads coated with FcMBL, we quantified molecular patterns captured in blood and analyzed their kinetics for 5 days. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) levels were sampled at 6-h intervals over the first 24 h of ICU admission, then at 12 h intervals on Day 2, and then daily through Day 5. To align the data from the real time of admission to the ICU, the ""Serial Measurements"" module in MedCalc((R)) software enabled the incorporation of advanced methods, such as mixed models. Outcomes were the persistence of sepsis after Day 5 and adherence to routine sepsis metrics. Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. At Day 5, 21 patients had recovered from sepsis with a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score < 2, while 18 were not. The initial values of PAMP yielded a median concentration of 5 ng/mL. The peak concentration was observed at 9 ng/mL, with a median delay of 24 h. Significant differences were observed in kinetic curves according to the SOFA score at Day 5, with a notable delay in time to peak (Tmax) for the prolonged sepsis group (Hour 48) compared to the short-term sepsis group (Hour 18) (p < 0.001). Compared to standard biomarkers, Tmax PAMP was the most discriminative factor for an unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular pattern levels captured by FcMBL during septic shock exhibited large inter-patient variability, suggesting values depend on numerous parameters. The signal's kinetics demonstrated predictive value and may contribute to clinical management.

41366293,T cell immunometabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: T lymphocyte dysfunction is closely associated with immunosuppression in sepsis, whereas the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. RESULTS: In this study, we established a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and observed immunometabolic alterations in splenic T cells. Serum energy metabolites related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were imbalanced. Splenic T cells from septic mice showed a shift in subset distribution, with decreased naive T cells and increased effector populations, along with concurrent activation and exhaustion phenotypes. Notably, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly diminished in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell, correlated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression. Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed mitochondrial morphological alterations in CLP-derived CD3(+) T cells. Furthermore, seahorse assays demonstrated impaired metabolic reprogramming capacity in activated CLP splenic CD3(+) T cells, with suppressed glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation responses. This impairment was coupled with reduced fold-increases in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential levels upon activation in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell compared to controls. Clinically, peripheral T cells from septic patients showed elevated CD69 and PD-1 expression, a significant increase in CD39 and a decrease in CD73, increased mitochondrial mass and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, particularly in those with septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide several layers of T cell dysfunction in sepsis, linking subset redistribution, an exhausted phenotype, mitochondrial impairment, and reduced proliferative capacity, suggesting that future therapeutic interventions aiming to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression may require a combinatorial approach."
41366266,Prognostic nutritional indices predict 60 day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is frequently accompanied by severe metabolic disturbances and malnutrition, with nutritional status being an important modifiable factor affecting patient outcomes. The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) are multidimensional tools for assessing nutritional status. However, the association between PNI/GNRI and 60-day mortality in patients with sepsis remain inadequately elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the value of PNI and GNRI for predicting the mortality risk in sepsis based on analysis of data from the MIMIC-IV database. A total of 1649 patients with sepsis were enrolled and stratified into tertiles of PNI and GNRI. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, complemented by subgroup analyses stratified by age, comorbidities, and treatments. Patients in the PNI- and GNRI-Q3 groups (high-score groups) demonstrated a 53% reduction in 60-day mortality risk relative to those in the PNI- and GNRI-Q1 groups (low-score groups) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.73]. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear inverse correlation between PNI and mortality risk, with elevated mortality risk (HR > 1) observed at low scores of PNI (< 20). Subgroup analyses indicated that PNI exhibited more pronounced protective effects in patients aged </= 65 years (HR = 0.33) and those treated with beta-lactam antibiotics (HR = 0.38). In contrast, GNRI showed better predictive value in elderly patients (> 65 years, HR = 0.61) and those with diabetes (HR = 0.37). Both PNI and GNRI are independent predictors of 60-day mortality in patients with sepsis. By integrating nutritional and immunological parameters, they provide valuable prognostic value beyond conventional measures. Incorporating PNI and GNRI into risk evaluation frameworks may help identify patients who may benefit from early nutritional interventions."
41365681,IL-33/ST2 Signaling Protects the Heart by Restraining Inflammation and Parasite Burden during Trypanosoma cruzi Experimental Infection.,2026,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people worldwide and often leads to fatal heart damage. The course of CD is influenced by how the immune system is tuned, which can protect the host and favor parasite persistence. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an alarmin released upon tissue injury that signals through the ST2 receptor, exerting context-dependent regulatory or pathogenic effects. However, the role of the IL-33/ST2 axis in T. cruzi-induced myocarditis remains unclear. Here, using ST2-deficient (ST2(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) female mice infected with the T. cruzi Y strain, we investigated its contribution to cardiac inflammation, tissue damage, and parasite burden. We found that ST2 signaling was not essential for controlling parasitemia, but its deficiency led to early onset myocarditis, disorganized fibrosis, and distinct electrical conduction. This severe immunopathology was driven by a remodeling of the cardiac immune landscape, with ST2(-/-) mice exhibiting an influx of IFN-gamma-producing monocytes and a shift in resident and monocyte-derived macrophages toward a pathogenic, pro-inflammatory phenotype. Likewise, the cardiac T cell compartment, including both conventional and gammadelta T cells, was skewed toward an inflammatory, IFN-gamma-driven profile. However, infected ST2-deficient mice also displayed higher cardiac parasite burden and impaired nitric oxide production, indicating a dysfunctional response in parasite control. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL-33/ST2 axis limits early systemic inflammation, orchestrates cardiac immune response, and protects against immunopathology and electrical remodeling during T. cruzi experimental infection. Targeting this pathway may offer therapeutic potential for preventing cardiac damage in CD."
41365608,Predictors for short-term outcome in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis: insight from Invention - HK registry.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Identify predictors for mortality and clinical short-term outcomes in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort investigating 376 patients who experienced left-sided IE between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2022, at the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita Hospital. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to identify predictors of short-term clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The study comprised 376 patients with left-sided IE who received standardised antibiotic therapy, with 56.6% of them undergoing surgical intervention. The observed short-term mortality rate was 18.6%. Furthermore, the morbidity profile during the treatment phase revealed the following incidences: sepsis in 27.1% of cases, intensive care unit stay exceeding 10 days in 18.6% of cases, mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days in 11.4% of cases, stroke in 28.5% of cases and acute renal failure in 57.7% of cases. CONCLUSION: Predictors of short-term mortality outcomes in patients with left-sided IE included New York Heart Association functional class III-IV, aortic valve vegetation involvement, vegetation size >/=10 mm, incomplete antibiotic administration, sepsis and the requirement for renal replacement therapy."
41365019,"A pan-azole and pan-echinocandin resistant Wickerhamomyces anomalus isolate causing bloodstream infection: ERG11(Y140F), (K151R) with copy number variation and FKS1(F665S) mutation.",2025,"Fungal infections pose a growing global threat, particularly due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. This study reports the first globally documented case of a Wickerhamomyces anomalus isolate (XN272) displaying dual high-level resistance to all tested azoles and echinocandins. Genomic analysis of the strain, which was isolated from a bloodstream infection in a 64-year-old male post-pancreatic surgery, identified two key resistance mechanisms: the azole target gene ERG11 harbored missense mutations (Y140H, K151R) and tandem copy number variations, while the echinocandin target gene FKS1 carried an F665S mutation. Transcriptomic profiling under antifungal exposure suggested an additional resistance mechanism, the upregulation of membrane-associated genes and efflux transporters (e.g., FLU1). Strain XN272 exhibited robust biofilm-forming capacity, a trait linked to reduced drug susceptibility. Despite its resistant phenotype, virulence assessments in immunosuppressed mice showed comparable tissue colonization and clearance rates to strain ATCC 8168. The discovery of pan-azole and pan-echinocandin resistance in W. anomalus highlights the expanding landscape of antifungal resistance and its clinical management challenges."
41364263,A review of management of benign post-esophagectomy respiratory-digestive fistula in esophageal cancer in China.,2026,"Post-esophagectomy respiratory-digestive fistula (PERDF) is a life-threatening complication that can develop after esophageal cancer resection. This complication consists of an abnormal connection formed between the digestive tract and the respiratory tract. Digestive juices can migrate into the respiratory tract through the fistula, leading to severe lung infections in PERDF patients which may cause sepsis, shock, or death. Although conservative treatments form the basis of management, they are often insufficient when used alone. Alternative therapies, including stent implantation, surgery, and endoscopic treatment, are crucial for effective management. Stent implantation is the most extensively studied and widely used method at present. Endoscopic treatment can be seen as an alternative once stenting fails. Surgery is usually limited by the patients' general condition. In some cases, it can be performed on patients with complex anatomical structures, failed stent implantation, or ineffective endoscopic treatment. In this article, we summarize current therapeutic strategies for PERDF and evaluate the potential of absorbable hydrogels as a future treatment option."
41363997,Comparison of Esmolol Versus Landiolol on Mortality in Adult Patients With Sepsis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: The clinical efficacy of short-acting beta-blockers in the management of sepsis remains uncertain. In particular, the comparative effects of two commonly used agents-esmolol and landiolol-have not been clearly established. This network meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of esmolol, landiolol, and standard of care (SOC) on mortality in patients with sepsis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov , preprints, and citation searching was conducted before April 15, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials that enrolled adult patients (>/= 18 yr) diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock and treated with beta-blockers and conducted in ICUs. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on study characteristics, enrolled patients' characteristics, administration strategies of drugs, and key clinical outcomes (including 28-d mortality, ICU length of stay, and other relevant endpoints). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 1165 records were identified through searches of five databases, registries, and relevant references up to April 15, 2025. Ten studies involving 1035 patients were included, after screening and eligibility assessment. Compared with esmolol, landiolol was associated with increased 28-day mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.08-2.30; low certainty) and higher norepinephrine requirements (mean difference [MD], 0.17 mug/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.02-0.32; low certainty). Esmolol significantly reduced 28-day mortality (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.85; moderate certainty) and 24-hour heart rate (MD, -16.92 beats/min; 95% CI, -23.49 to -10.36; moderate certainty) compared with SOC. In contrast, landiolol increased norepinephrine use compared with SOC (MD, 0.09 mug/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.01-0.18; moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with sepsis treated with beta-blockers, esmolol probably improves clinical outcomes compared with SOC. However, the effect of landiolol remains uncertain due to the low certainty of evidence. Esmolol may confer a relative clinical advantage over landiolol, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding and elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
41363878,Antimicrobial stewardship in critical care.,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the most significant threats to global health, largely driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. This review outlines the current principles and practices of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in the context of critical care. We address the global burden of AMR, the development of resistance and the implementation of AMS strategies from multidisciplinary, diagnostic and pharmacokinetic perspectives. The use of rapid diagnostics, biomarkers such as procalcitonin, and the integration of electronic health records are discussed as enablers of targeted therapy and improved outcomes. Special populations, such as transplant recipients and critically ill patients with sepsis, are examined in the context of AMS, with attention to therapy optimization and resistance prevention. Challenges in implementation - especially in low-resource settings - are addressed, highlighting the need for global cooperation and infrastructure investment. Through evidence-based strategies, stewardship programs aim to enhance antimicrobial efficacy, minimize resistance development, and improve patient outcomes. This review advocates for the responsible use of antimicrobials across all care settings and emphasizes the necessity of continuous education, surveillance and adaptation in AMS policy and practice."
41363715,Low Diastolic Blood Pressure and Risk of Ischemic Colitis in the Women's Health Initiative Cohort.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: To identify risk and protective factors in older women for incidence of ischemic colitis (IC) and 30-day mortality. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 100,825 women in the Women's Health Initiative, with an average of 13.1-year follow-up and extensive phenotypic and outcomes data in diverse race and ethnic groups. Lasso Cox regression selected variables related to incidence of IC from multiple domains (demographic, comorbidities, risk factors, biomarkers, psychosocial factors, and dietary factors). Cox regressions modelled the selected variables to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rate of IC was twice as high among those with a history of cardiovascular disease (55.7 per 10,000 person-years) compared with those with no such history (27.3 per 10,000 person-years). After adjustment for multiple covariates, higher risk was associated with diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, using 2 or more types of antihypertensive medications compared with none (aHR 1.62, 95% CI 1.47-1.78), having gastrointestinal symptoms (aHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.42 highest vs lowest quartile). Higher fiber intake was associated with lower risk (aHR per increase of 10 g/d 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97), and Black women had lower adjusted risk of IC than White women (aHR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.83). Post-IC 30-day all-cause mortality was 10.6%, and sepsis was an important cause of death. DISCUSSION: The incidence rate of IC in older women was twice as high in those with a history of cardiovascular disease and was associated with low diastolic blood pressure and multiclass antihypertensive treatment. Dietary fiber intake was associated with lower risk. Black women had lower risk of IC compared with White women."
41363673,Predictive Factors for Infectious Complications after Robotic Gastrectomy for Gastric or Esophagogastric Junction Cancer.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic gastrectomy offers perioperative advantages such as reduced blood loss and faster recovery; however, infectious complications remain a significant concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the predictive factors for postoperative infectious complications following radical robotic gastrectomy in patients with gastric or esophagogastric junctional cancer. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study analyzed data from 155 patients with gastric or esophagogastric junction cancer who underwent curative robotic gastrectomy between December 2017 and April 2025 to identify predictive factors for postoperative infectious complications. Twenty-two variables, including nutritional indices and surgical factors, were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients developed Clavien-Dindo grade II-IIIa infectious complications. Infectious complications included pneumonia (n = 5, 3.2%), intra-abdominal abscess (n = 5, 3.2%), anastomotic leakage (n = 3, 1.9%), cholecystitis (n = 2, 1.2%), nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (n = 1, 0.6%), bile leakage (n = 1, 0.6%), and sepsis (n = 1, 0.6%). The number of patients with complications and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) class >/=3 (p = 0.006) and preoperative smoking (p = 0.012) was higher than that among patients without complications. Although hemoglobin levels (p = 0.041) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios (p = 0.017) were lower in patients with complications, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios (p = 0.034) were higher. Multivariate analysis revealed that current smoking (odds ratio, 3.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-18.21) and ASA-PS class of >/=3 (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-7.52) were identified as predictors of infectious complications. CONCLUSION: Robotic gastrectomy offers technical advantages, but optimizing patient-specific risk is essential for the best outcomes. Preoperative smoking and a high ASA-PS class were independent predictors of infectious complications following robotic gastrectomy. Enhanced perioperative management targeting these risk factors may reduce postoperative morbidity."
41362613,Prognostic impact of persistent versus transient sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia in multicohort data.,2025,"Thrombocytopenia (TP) in patients with sepsis is associated with adverse outcomes. Previous research has predominantly focused on the severity of TP, while the prognostic impact of its duration remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to investigate the association between the duration of sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) and clinical outcomes. Over a 28-day observation period, patients with persistent TP (duration > 3 days) had significantly fewer ventilator-free days, intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, and hospital-free days (all p < 0.001) than those with transient TP (resolution within 1-3 days). Persistent TP was associated with significantly increased mortality (p < 0.001) and transfusion rates (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that transient TP was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (p > 0.05), whereas persistent TP remained an independent risk factor (p < 0.05). A 3-day cutoff to differentiate between transient and persistent SAT demonstrated significant clinical utility. The duration of TP offers additional, valuable prognostic information, potentially guiding risk stratification and therapeutic strategies."
41362528,Stenting the Unexpected: Endovascular Management of a Common Carotid Artery Pseudoaneurysm in a 79-Year-Old Woman.,2025,"Arterial pseudoaneurysms (PsA) are uncommon vascular abnormalities that may have various causes of diverse nature, and the treatment should be individualized and tailored to the patient and concomitant clinical conditions. We present a case report of a 79-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed incidentally with a carotid artery pseudoaneurysm accompanied by internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The pseudoaneurysm was secondary to staphylococcal sepsis, which was successfully treated three months earlier. Both the aneurysm and the stenosis were simultaneously successfully treated with an endovascular approach. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) performed one month later demonstrated a significant decrease in the size of the pseudoaneurysm. No postoperative complications were observed."
41362205,Performance Evaluation of an In-House Blood Culture Pretreatment Kit and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry for Rapid Identification of Microorganisms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The challenge in the use of MALDI-TOF MS for detection of microorganisms in culture-positive blood bottles is sample preparation. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an in-house blood culture pretreatment kit coupled with MALDI-TOF MS system for directly identifying pathogens. METHODS: A total of 114 blood samples were pre-enriched and identified using an in-house blood culture pretreatment kit and MALDI-TOF MS. The performance of the methods was compared to that of the conventional bacte-rial culture plus VITEK(R) 2 Compact. RESULTS: The kit showed high identification rates for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, compared to that of conventional bacterial culture (p > 0.05). The identification rate of Gram-negative bacteria using the serum separator tube method was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The kit can be used for the pretreatment of blood culture bottles, which can significantly shorten the identification and reporting times."
41361789,Phosphate-Binding Zn(II)-Coordinated Antimicrobial Peptoids: Enhancing Selectivity through Specific Recognition of Bacterial Membranes.,2026,"The global spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria underscores the urgent need for antimicrobial agents with enhanced efficacy and selectivity. Here, we developed antimicrobial peptoids conjugated with zinc-dipicolylamine (ZnDPA) and bivalent Zn(2)BPMP motifs for improved bacterial membrane recognition via phosphate binding. The Zn(2)BPMP-containing peptoids, 5_Zn(2) and 8_Zn(4), exhibited the highest bacterial selectivity, achieving an increase in selectivity index of >10-fold. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed reduced toxicity against mammalian cells. Mechanistically, Zn(2)BPMP conjugation enhanced binding to anionic bacterial surface components, including lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids, and promoted inner membrane disruption. Furthermore, in a model of multidrug-resistant E. coli-induced sepsis, 5_Zn(2) exhibited potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity with low in vivo toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. These findings provide insights into the rational design of antimicrobial peptoids and peptidomimetics to selectively target bacteria and highlight their potential as next-generation therapeutics."
41361753,Hypothyroidism as a risk factor for perioperative complications in lumbar spine surgery: a national database study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent endocrine disorder increasingly recognized as a potential modifier of perioperative risk in orthopedic surgery. Emerging evidence indicates associations between hypothyroidism and adverse perioperative outcomes, including systemic complications and delayed recovery, in orthopedic populations. However, existing analyses remain limited by small sample sizes, lack of surgical subtype stratification, and insufficient focus on lumbar spine surgery (LSS) specifically. To address this gap, we leveraged data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to clarify the association between hypothyroidism and perioperative complications in patients undergoing LSS. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the NIS database (2013-2022). LSS patients were identified by ICD-9/10 codes and further divided into hypothyroid and non-hypothyroid cohorts. Propensity scores were calculated and matched in 1:1 ratios for patients with hypothyroidism to patients without hypothyroidism based on patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, Perioperative complications were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 873,110 LSS patients, 11.66% were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroid patients were older (median age 64 versus 59 years, P < 0.001). Before stratification, hypothyroidism was associated with significantly increased odds ratios (ORs) for the following complications in the overall lumbar spine surgery patient cohort: sepsis, postoperative shock, postoperative delirium, acute cerebrovascular disease, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, transfusion, wound infection, wound dehiscence, in-hospital mortality, and prolonged length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001 for all). After stratification, patients who underwent lumbar fusion alone demonstrated significantly elevated Odds Ratios (ORs) for all complications. In contrast, among those who underwent lumbar decompression alone or discectomy alone, the increases in ORs for wound infection and wound dehiscence were not statistically significant. Furthermore, for the discectomy-alone subgroup, the elevated ORs for postoperative shock and acute myocardial infarction also lacked statistical significance. For all other complications, the subgroups showed elevated ORs that were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a correlation between hypothyroidism and a higher risk of complications in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. This finding indicates that surgeons should exercise heightened vigilance with lumbar surgery patients who have co-existing hypothyroidism."
41361579,In silico pathogenomics of draft metagenome-assembled genome of gut Enterobacter cloacae from a gastroenteritis patient exhibiting potential determinants of multi-drug resistance and virulence.,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered one of the top 10 threats to global public health and development. Opportunistic bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae have been reported to acquire resistance determinants, making them pathogenic reservoirs and a threat to health and most are on the path of becoming superbugs. These bacteria are commonly isolated along with pathogens from the stool and urine of patients diagnosed with typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection or sepsis. The E. cloacae strain EC78 studied here is a metagenomic-assembled genome that was binned from sequenced data of a mixed bacterial culture taken from a patient diagnosed with gastroenteritis. The isolate was sequenced with Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform and analysed with various bioinformatics tools. EC78 origin strain contained antibiotics resistance genes, insertion sequences, phages, and virulence factors. Notable virulence genes responsible for immune modulation, efflux of drugs, invasion and nutritional virulence previously reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., and Salmonella sp. etc., were identified in EC78. Genetic characteristics that could contribute to pathogenicity, virulence, and antibiotic resistance, not commonly associated with E. cloacae, were identified in gut-domiciled EC78, suggesting the evolution of counter-therapy in the bacteria, probably driven by its quest for survival in an otherwise competitive biome."
41361410,Intravesical migration of intrauterine device complicated by multifocal sepsis from ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess and acute appendicitis: a comprehensive clinical case study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine device (IUD) migration is a rare but serious complication of IUD use, most often resulting from unnoticed uterine perforation. However, intravesical migration complicated by multifocal sepsis from ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and acute appendicitis is an exceedingly rare and complex clinical scenario. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old multiparous Asian female with history of IUD placement presented with features of sepsis. Laboratory and radiological investigations, and quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score were promptly done. The assessment was intravesical IUD migration complicated by multifocal sepsis and septic shock due to ruptured TOA and acute appendicitis. She had resuscitation and an urgent combined minimal access surgical intervention. Her postoperative recovery was rapid, and she was discharged four days after surgery. CONCLUSION: This rare case demonstrates the importance of early recognition of sepsis, the relevant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of managing a critically ill gynecology patient with a migrated IUD complicated by multifocal sepsis and the significance of patient education and appropriate follow-up after IUD insertion."
41361350,"Ferritinophagy-related prognostic genes UBE2Q1, NEDD4L, and TCP11L2 for prognosis prediction in sepsis.",2025,"Sepsis remains a critical global health threat characterized by high mortality and complex immune-metabolic dysregulation. This study identifies ferritinophagy-related prognostic genes (FRGs) that are causally linked to sepsis outcomes using a multi-omics approach integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomics with Mendelian randomization. Among 1047 candidate genes, UBE2Q1, NEDD4L, and TCP11L2 were selected to build a risk model that effectively stratified sepsis patients and predicted mortality. Functional enrichment analysis revealed associations with oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome function, and Parkinson's disease pathways. Immune infiltration analysis identified increased gammadelta T and NK cell levels in high-risk patients, with significant correlations to prognostic genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed dynamic gene expression shifts across key immune cell types including T cells, monocytes, and platelets. Cell-cell communication and pseudo-time analyses highlighted the roles of UBE2Q1 and NEDD4L in immune regulation and development. This study provides preliminary clues that ferritin and autophagy-related genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis, and proposes potential molecular targets that can be used for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention."
41360904,Impact of meningoencephalitis and sepsis on delirium and subsequent neurological impairment in pediatric patients: a prospective proof-of-concept biomarker and EEG study.,2025,"To assess the incidence and severity of delirium and subsequent neurological impairment in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients with meningoencephalitis (ME) and sepsis. Prospective study enrolling PICU patients with sepsis or meningoencephalitis (ME) and healthy controls. Daily delirium assessment, repeated electroencephalography, blood sampling at days 1, 3, 5 and lumbar puncture, if clinically indicated, for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling were performed. Biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, PCT, IL-6), endothelial activation (NT-proCNP), neurodegeneration (NSE, tau), neuroaxonal damage (NfL, NfH, UCHL-1) and glial injury (GFAP, S100B) were measured. Neurological status was assessed using the Functional Status Scale (FSS), the pediatric overall performance category (POPC) and the pediatric cerebral performance scale (PCPC) before admission and after three months. Twenty-four PICU patients (ME n = 9, sepsis n = 15) and eleven controls were enrolled. The delirium incidence was not statistically higher in patients with sepsis (60%, n = 9/15) compared to ME (33%, n = 3/9, p = 0.105). Children with delirium (n = 12) had a higher FSS (10.0 [9.8, 12.0] vs. 7.5 [7.0, 9.0], p = 0.009) at day 1 than children without delirium (n = 12), without significant differences in blood and CSF biomarker levels. Patients with ME presented higher levels of blood NfL compared to sepsis patients at day 3 (16.8 [12.9, 77.5] vs. 10.7 [8.6, 12.2] pg/ml, p = 0.011) and day 5 (16.2 [6.8, 170.4] vs. 12.0 [7.9, 14.3] pg/ml, p = 0.005). Routine EEG results did not differ between the groups, but quantitative EEG parameters representing encephalopathy correlated with biomarkers of brain injury. FSS, POPC and PCPC after three months were identical between in all patients. Independent from the origin of inflammatory stimulation by sepsis or ME delirium is associated with transient neurological dysfunction in PICU patients, without neurological impairment after three months, as confirmed by biomarker levels."
41360440,Parasitic colitis misdiagnosis as inflammatory bowel disease in high-income settings and association with poor clinical outcomes when exposed to corticosteroids: a systematic review of case reports.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Parasitic colitis is highly prevalent worldwide, may mimic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is encountered by non-specialist physicians in high-income, non-endemic settings. In this context, patients may be at risk of misdiagnosis and poor outcomes. However, cases are not routinely reported, limiting the evidence base to individual case reports. We aimed to systematically describe and evaluate the diagnosis, clinical course and outcomes of affected patients whose cases have been reported in high-income settings. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses framework. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for publications from between 1 January 2012 and 10 January 2025. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Case reports of undifferentiated colitis presenting in high-income settings, where the aetiological agent was ultimately found to be parasitological, were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria included a history of travel to an endemic area within 4 weeks of presentation. No language restrictions were applied. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Key components of each case report, encompassing patient presentation, diagnosis and management, were standardised as categorical descriptors. Key themes were identified, and a thematic synthesis approach was employed. RESULTS: 52 articles, describing 54 patients, were included in the final analysis: 33 cases of amoebiasis, 15 cases of strongyloidiasis and 6 cases of schistosomiasis. Misdiagnosis occurred in 37 out of 54 patients (69%), with 28 out of 37 (76%) of these misdiagnosed as IBD. Substantial harm was reported in 31 out of 54 (57%) patients, including death in seven patients. Major morbidity (defined as strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, fulminant amoebic colitis, emergency surgery or sepsis) or death was associated with administration of corticosteroids in cases of strongyloidiasis and amoebiasis, occurring in 8 out of 9 (89%) and 1 out of 6 (17%) patients with strongyloidiasis who received/did not receive corticosteroids, and 10 out of 13 (77%) and 2 out of 20 (10%) patients with amoebiasis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Parasitic colitis poses a diagnostic challenge in high-income settings. Misdiagnosis as IBD is commonly reported, with poor outcomes related to corticosteroid treatment. Awareness of parasitic colitis aetiologies, at-risk groups and diagnostic tests is essential among generalist clinicians assessing undifferentiated colitis to avoid poor outcomes.

41360226,Targeting the DYNLL2-PAK1 axis inhibits caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis to alleviate sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host responses to infection, lacks effective therapeutic strategies due to its complex immune pathophysiology. Here, we identify Dynein Light Chain LC8-Type 2 (DYNLL2) as a critical risk gene driving sepsis progression through bioinformatics and machine learning analysis of clinical datasets. Elevated DYNLL2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and monocyte expansion in sepsis patients. Mechanistically, DYNLL2 interacts with p21-Activated Kinase 1 (PAK1) to regulate the endocytosis of Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), facilitating cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release and subsequent Caspase-11 inflammasome activation, thereby triggering pyroptosis. Depletion of DYNLL2 or PAK1 suppresses OMV internalization, Caspase-11/Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, and proinflammatory cytokine release without affecting bacterial clearance. Virtual screening identifies Oroxylin A, a flavonoid compound, as a potent inhibitor of the DYNLL2-PAK1 interaction. In vitro, Oroxylin A blocks Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis by reducing cytosolic LPS levels. In murine endotoxemia models, Oroxylin A improves survival, mitigates multi-organ damage, and suppresses systemic inflammation. Our findings reveal the DYNLL2-PAK1 axis as a pivotal regulator of sepsis pathogenesis and propose Oroxylin A as a promising therapeutic candidate to disrupt pyroptosis and restore immune homeostasis in sepsis."
41360218,Clinical value of neutrophil extracellular trap-related biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction in older patients: A case-control study.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical utility of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-related biomarkers as potential diagnostic and prognostic indicators for sepsis in older patients. METHODS: 39 sepsis older patients (age > 60 years) diagnosed and 28 older patients suffering from infections between August 2024 and April 2025 were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood plasma was collected to measure NET-related biomarkers, including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) complex, and nucleosomes. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Patients with sepsis exhibited significantly higher levels of dsDNA, citH3, MPO-DNA, and nucleosomes compared to controls. Non-surviving patients with sepsis had notably elevated dsDNA levels compared to survivors. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association between NET-related biomarkers, neutrophil counts, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that dsDNA was a reliable diagnostic marker for sepsis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.92, P < 0.001) and mortality prediction (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.75-0.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: NET-related biomarkers, particularly dsDNA and MPO-DNA, are significantly elevated in sepsis older patients and are independently associated with an increased risk of sepsis."
41359645,Molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities driving sepsis and atrial fibrillation: A Systematic study based on bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and atrial fibrillation are complex, life-threatening medical conditions affecting approximately 49 million individuals globally, characterized by exceptionally high mortality rates. Lipid metabolism abnormalities play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: This innovative study systematically investigates the shared molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities in sepsis and atrial fibrillation using advanced bioinformatics and machine learning methodologies. Methods: We retrieved two independent research cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus database: sepsis-related datasets and atrial fibrillation-related datasets. A multi-dimensional analytical approach was employed, including differential expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, machine learning models, immune cell infiltration analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis to comprehensively elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities in these diseases. RESULTS: Comprehensive analysis identified 13 key candidate genes, with CD81, CKAP4, and DPEP2 emerging as core characteristic genes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed these genes primarily participate in mitochondrial function regulation, complement-coagulation cascade, and cell adhesion molecular pathways. Machine learning models demonstrated exceptional diagnostic performance, with area under the curve values of 0.957 for sepsis and 1.000 for atrial fibrillation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis unveiled the critical roles of neutrophils and monocytes in disease progression, and revealed the profound impact of lipid metabolism abnormalities on immune regulation. CONCLUSION: We discovered that lipid metabolism abnormalities significantly modulate disease progression by influencing mitochondrial function, inflammatory responses, and cell adhesion pathways. Future research necessitates further clinical validation and functional experiments to explore personalized therapeutic strategies based on lipid reprogramming."
41359607,Lactate dehydrogenase is an indicator for outcomes of short-term and long-term in septic patients.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and clinical outcomes in sepsis was explored based on MIMIC-IV database. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Models including unadjusted model and adjusted models were performed for exploring the association of LDH with 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality. The smooth fitting curves were constructed by using generalized additive model. The predictive value of LDH for clinical outcomes in sepsis was evaluated. The statistical software of EmpowerStats (http://www. empowerstats. com) and R (http://www.R-project.org) were applied for analysis. RESULTS: 6775 sepsis patients were included. After adjusted for all potential confounders, for every 100 IU/L increment in LDH, the risk of 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality increased by 11% (odds ratio (OR)=1.11, 95%CI:1.08-1.13, P < 0.0001) and 12% (OR=1.12, 95%CI:1.09-1.14, P < 0.0001), respectively. The areas under the ROC curve of LDH for predicting mortalities of 30-day and 1-year were 0.667 (95%CI:0.652-0.681) and 0.646 (95%CI: 0.632-0.660), respectively. CONCLUSION: LDH was positively correlated with 30-day and 1-year mortalities in sepsis and the relationship was nonlinear."
41359203,"Think sepsis, write sepsis, code sepsis - patient characteristics associated with sepsis (under-)coding in administrative health data.",2026,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, yet its documentation and coding in administrative health data remain unreliable. Accurate coding is essential for epidemiological surveillance, quality assurance, and reimbursement. This study aims to identify patient characteristics associated with under-diagnosis and under-coding of sepsis in German inpatient administrative health data (IAHD). METHODS: This secondary analysis of the multicenter OPTIMISE study included 10,334 hospital cases from ten German hospitals (2015-2017). Sepsis cases were identified via structured chart review and compared to ICD-coded diagnoses. Logistic regression and classification tree analyses were used to determine predictors of under-diagnosis and under-coding, including ICU admission, organ dysfunction, and infection source. RESULTS: Among 1,310 cases fulfilling severe sepsis-1 criteria, only 30.7% were correctly coded. The strongest predictor for coding accuracy was explicit mention of sepsis in the medical chart (OR 19.58). ICU treatment, organ dysfunction severity, and mechanical ventilation were also associated with higher coding rates, while pneumonia as the infection source was linked to a lower probability of sepsis being named and coded. CONCLUSION: Sepsis coding in administrative data is frequently inaccurate. Explicit naming of sepsis and severity markers strongly influence correct coding. As Germany introduces mandatory sepsis quality assurance in 2026, targeted interventions - including enhanced clinician documentation and electronic coding support - are essential to improve coding reliability and patient care."
41359162,IER3 drives the transition from sepsis-associated AKI to CKD by suppressing the mitochondrial translocation of PRDX5.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI) is a severe condition associated with high mortality and long-term complications. Currently, there is no effective strategy to halt AKI chronicization. Stress-induced senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) is a pivotal driving mechanism in the AKI-CKD transition. Previous scRNA-seq revealed that the expression of immediate early response gene 3 (IER3) was markedly upregulated in the senescent RTECs of patients with AKI and that the IER3(+)RTEC subpopulation exhibited diminished differentiation potential and impaired self-renewal capacity. However, the role of IER3 in RTEC stress-induced senescence following AKI remains unclear. In this study, we found that knockout of IER3 reduced mortality rates, alleviated renal injury, mitigated renal maladaptive fibrotic repair, and concurrently inhibited RTEC stress-induced senescence after SAKI. Further RNA-seq of IER3(-/-) mouse renal tissues revealed significant upregulation of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) in the absence of IER3. Inhibition of PRDX5 blocked the effects of IER3 knockout on RTEC stress-induced senescence under septic conditions. Intriguingly, we found that IER3 interacted with the presenilin-associated rhomboid-like gene (Parl) and reduced its shear activity. This interaction also inhibited the cleavage and subsequent mitochondrial translocation of cytoplasmic PRDX5, leading to decreased mitochondrial levels in PRDX5 and impaired antioxidant capacity. These changes resulted in oxidative mitochondrial damage and abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria, which promote stress-induced cellular senescence and ultimately facilitates the transition from AKI to CKD. In conclusion, our findings suggest that IER3 might induce RTEC senescence and exacerbate the AKI-CKD transition in sepsis-associated AKI by inhibiting mitochondrial translocation of PRDX5."
41359118,A novel preoperative risk score for predicting Urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: validation and clinical application.,2025,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common and serious complication after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).This study develops and validates the PuRass scoring system to predict the risk of UTI, including urinary sepsis, after PCNL and support personalized clinical Management. A retrospective analysis of 293 PCNL patients was conducted, incorporating multiple risk factors, including gender, age, diabetes, preoperative white blood cell count, urine analysis and culture results, stone size and type, and the degree of hydronephrosis. Significant risk factors were identified through meta-analysis and integrated into PuRass, with each factor weighted according to its odds ratio (OR) value to establish a quantitative risk assessment model. Results showed that gender, age, diabetes, elevated white blood cell count, and positive urine analysis and culture results significantly increased the risk of post-PCNL UTI. The PuRass model demonstrated excellent predictive performance in ROC curve analysis, achieving 90% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity, with an optimal threshold of 8.5 points. Early intervention strategies based on PuRass effectively reduced infection rates and hospital stays in high-risk patients. This study indicates that PuRass provides a reliable tool for predicting and managing post-PCNL UTI. Future multicenter studies will further validate its clinical applicability and explore its integration with emerging technologies to enhance postoperative management."
41359028,Current standard of care for septic shock.,2026,"Sepsis is a syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction that results from dysregulated host response to infection, with septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, a serum lactate > 2 mmol/L and the need for a vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg. Approximately, 49 million cases of sepsis are recorded worldwide annually, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths, the majority occurring in patients with septic shock. A substantial proportion of survivors suffer from moderate to severe functional limitations including physical, cognitive and psychological disability, exacerbation of pre-existing chronic conditions and a high incidence of re-hospitalisation in the first 12 months after the initial diagnosis. Optimal management of patients with septic shock requires prompt and reliable recognition of patients with sepsis who require additional haemodynamic support. Initially, patients will need judicious intravenous fluids and consideration of the need for vasopressors such as norepinephrine. Administration of appropriate antibiotics and consideration for control of the source of infection are also required. In the optimisation phase, depending on patients' comorbidities and response to therapy, the balance of fluid therapy, vasopressors and potentially the addition of an inotropic agent will need to be adjusted, based on clinical findings and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters. For those patients who do not respond to initial therapy, more intensive monitoring may be required with consideration of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids, vasopressin, angiotensin II or other rescue therapies to achieve cardiovascular stability. Once stability has been achieved, clinicians need to consider strategies to ameliorate the potential long-term effects on survivors, while keeping in mind the perspective and experience of their patients."
41358778,"Epidemiology, clinical features, antifungal resistance, and prognosis of fungemia in pediatric patients.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, antifungal susceptibility, and prognosis of fungemia among pediatric patients. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 195 fungemia cases at Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Maternal and Child Health Hospital over a 7-year period (2016-2023). Comprehensive clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of 195 fungemia cases revealed 22 distinct fungal species. Candida parapsilosis was the predominant pathogen (28.2%, 55/195), followed by Candida albicans (26.7%, 52) and Candida tropicalis (10.8%, 21). The cohort demonstrated distinctive epidemiological features: median patient age of 30 days, neonatal predominance (40.5%), and male preponderance (60%). Alarmingly high antifungal resistance profiles were observed, particularly in C. albicans (66% fluconazole and 62% voriconazole resistance) and C. dubliniensis (82% itraconazole resistance). Non-albicans infections correlated with elevated intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates and neutropenia incidence, while C. albicans cases showed stronger associations with prematurity and low birth weight. The clinical course was marked by prolonged hospitalization (median 37 days), with 56.4% requiring intensive care and 20% developing persistent candidemia. 81.5% achieved clinical resolution, though 15.4% required non-medical transfers and 3.0% succumbed to refractory infections despite maximal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates represented the highest-risk population for pediatric fungemia, with a median hospitalization duration of 37 days. Over half of the affected children (56.4%) required ICU admission. The high rate of antifungal resistance and poor prognosis underscore the urgent need for enhanced surveillance protocols and optimized antifungal stewardship in pediatric settings."
41358753,Blood culture utilization and impact of stewardship practices during a national blood culture bottle shortage at a cancer center.,2026,"Formulating safe and effective diagnostic stewardship guidance for blood cultures in immunocompromised patients is challenging due to limited data and high risk of infectious complications. A 2024 global shortage in blood culture bottles (BD Diagnostics) necessitated the implementation of blood culture stewardship, including at our tertiary care cancer center. This was a retrospective pre-post intervention study of the effects of diagnostic stewardship at a stand-alone cancer center during a 5-month period of the 2024 blood culture bottle shortage compared to the same 5-month unaffected period in 2023. Interventions included discontinuation of an ordering set for persistent fever, modification of an ordering set for new fever to recommend two sets of blood cultures for initial workup, and issuing revised blood culture ordering guidance to providers, phlebotomists, and nurses with repeated educational efforts. Stewardship interventions led to decreased blood culture utilization by 36.3% (from 14,021 to 8,932), while the number of patients tested remained similar. Greatest reductions in utilization occurred in inpatient encounters and with follow-up blood cultures. There was a trend toward increasing blood culture positivity following intervention, excluding potential contaminants (7.1% vs 7.6%, P = 0.08). The frequency of sepsis-coded encounters and 30-day mortality rate were similar between the two time periods. No adverse outcomes related to blood culture stewardship were reported. A significant reduction in blood culture utilization is achievable in a high-complexity cancer patient population without negative clinical impact through limiting the number of initial blood cultures and eliminating pre-emptive ordering of blood culture orders for persistent fever.IMPORTANCECancer and transplant patient populations are frequently excluded from experimental studies on decreasing blood culture utilization, but a recent global supply shortage in blood culture bottles provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate the effects of stewardship interventions on a large scale. This study, centered on a high-complexity cancer patient population, found that a significant 36.3% reduction in blood culture utilization was achievable, safe, and effective through multidisciplinary diagnostic stewardship efforts."
41358744,Whole-genome sequencing-based pathogen characterization for streptococcal infection directly from positive blood culture samples.,2026,"Clinical laboratories are increasingly using diagnostic tests directly on positive blood cultures, which may lead to fewer attempts to recover bacterial isolates. Consequently, public health laboratories can benefit from assays that directly process blood culture samples without requiring submission of clinical isolates to determine additional pathogen features not identified by clinical tests, such as vaccine serotype and bacterial genomic relatedness, for surveillance and outbreak response purposes. In partnership with the Minnesota Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) site, we identified blood culture samples positive for ABCs streptococcal pathogens and characterized them by a direct whole-genome sequencing from blood culture (dWGS) assay. The dWGS results were compared with the results of a reference method (WGS of isolates from the same cultures) to evaluate concordance in pathogen features and genome assemblies. Of the 97 eligible blood culture samples, 83 (86%) passed dWGS quality control criteria and were subjected to a total of 655 dWGS-based tests, which yielded 651 (99.3%) evaluable results. The percent agreement with reference results was 100% (83/83) for M protein gene (emm)/capsular types and 100% (81/81) for multilocus sequencing types. For genotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing prediction, the percent prediction agreement was 100% (487/487), false resistant prediction rate was 0% (0/417), and the false susceptible prediction rate was 0% (0/66). Assemblies of pathogen genomes from the same patient differed by 1.08 +/- 1.68 (mean +/- SD) sites per genome. The dWGS assay can extract high-quality, important streptococcal strain characteristics directly from positive blood culture samples to support evolving public health needs.IMPORTANCEWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies have emerged as a transformative toolkit used by public health microbiology laboratories to detect and characterize pathogens. The surveillance of bacterial diseases often relies on clinical laboratories to submit pathogen isolates to regional or national public health laboratories, which have the capacity to routinely conduct WGS-based strain characterization. Clinical laboratories are increasingly using diagnostic tests directly on positive blood cultures, which may lead to fewer attempts to recover bacterial isolates. The study evaluated a direct whole-genome sequencing from blood culture (dWGS) assay that directly processes blood culture samples. The dWGS assay recovered high quality, important streptococcal strain characteristics, including vaccine serotypes and whole-genome assemblies, without requiring submission of clinical isolates. Thus, the dWGS assay represents a promising tool for addressing the evolving needs of public health laboratories in the metagenomics era."
41357996,Low NAPR as a Novel Indicator for Predicting Escherichia coli Bloodstream Infection and Improved Prognostic Outcomes in Elderly Hospitalized Inpatients: A 12-years Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with significant mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (E.coli) is the most common causative organism in BSIs, but non-E.coli BSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Predictive biomarkers including the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPAR) have not been well studied in elderly hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to compare the mortality in patients with E.coli and non-E.coli BSIs and, evaluate NPAR as a potential predictive biomarker for E.coli infection in extremely elderly inpatients. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted, involving 510 elderly patients diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Patients were divided into two groups based on the pathogen responsible for the infection: E.coli (n=92) and non-E.coli (n=418). Clinical data, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters were systematically collected. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess mortality risk, adjusting for relevant confounding variables. The predictive value of NPAR for E.coli bloodstream infection was analyzed via odds ratios (OR) and trend tests. Microbiological analysis of blood samples was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocols. RESULTS: Non-E.coli BSIs was associated with greater mortality compared to E.coli BSI; hazard ratio (HR)=0.43 (95% CI=0.21, 0.88; P=0.021). NPAR was a significant predictor of E.coli BSI; for continuous NPAR, the odds of E.coli BSI decreased by 12% per unit increase in NPAR (OR=0.88; 95% CI=0.84, 0.93; P<0.001). The odds ratio of the lowest tertile of NPAR versus rest was 0.21 (95% CI=0.11, 0.40, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-E.coli BSIs are associated with greater mortality in elderly patients, while low NPAR is strongly associated with E.coli BSI. These findings suggest that NPAR may be useful for early risk stratification and clinical management of elderly patients with BSIs."
41357804,"Low lymphozyte pool, colon perforation and hydrocephalus as clinical features in an infant with a postzygotic PIK3CA variant.",2025,"Pathogenic variants in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the p110-alpha catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), are commonly associated with overgrowth syndromes and cancer. We report a patient with the point variant c.1030G>A p.(Val344Met) in the PIK3CA gene who presented shortly after birth with viral sepsis and and severe lymphopenia, followed by colonic perforations. Histopathology showed ulcerative necrotizing colitis with lymphatic vascular malformation. The patient subsequently developed hydrocephalus requiring a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, complicated by refractory ascites that resolved with acetazolamide therapy. Awareness of the potential disease spectrum through early molecular diagnosis, combined with a comprehensive immunologic evaluation, enabled individualized management via closer clinical monitoring and timely interventions to prevent and control neurological and infectious complications. This case highlights the phenotypic heterogeneity of PIK3CA pathogenic variants and the importance of early precision medicine in pediatric care."
41357797,Channel selection of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in infants pathogen detection: a multicenter cross-sectional study.,2025,"In the neonatal period, infectious diseases associated with high morbidity (e.g., neonatal sepsis and meningitis) are preliminarily assessed using indicators like C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, but definitive diagnosis relies on pathogen detection through methods such as blood culture, which is time-consuming and has low sensitivity. To improve diagnostic efficiency, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly utilized, offering three testing modalities: DNA-only, RNA-only, and combined DNA+RNA channels. This retrospective study analyzed 894 clinical samples (peripheral blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) to compare detection rates across channels. The overall mNGS positivity rate was 51.9% (464/894), with no significant differences among DNA-only (50.8%), RNA-only (55.7%), and combined channels (49.6%) (p > 0.05). Notably, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples exhibited the highest positivity rate (84.57%, 148/175), reaching 97.33% (73/75) with dual-channel testing. Sputum samples showed a 53.7% positivity rate (87/172), increasing to 82.35% (14/17) with dual-channel detection. Conversely, peripheral blood had an overall positivity rate of 43.14% (132/306), with the DNA-only channel outperforming RNA-only and dual channels (45.34% 5s. 43.00% and 34.21%). These findings underscore the importance of channel selection based on sample type to optimize diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness."
41357792,21(st) century innovations in pediatrics.,2025,"21(st)-century innovations in pediatrics have made remarkable advancements in enhancing patient care and making care accessible even in remote areas. This abstract provides a concise summary of the latest innovations in pediatrics. Recent innovations in Pediatrics include Telemedicine, where people can connect with specialists using electronic technology, helping those in remote areas access timely care. Advances in neonatal care have effectively created solutions for several conditions, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. The use of wearable technology has shown promise in several areas, including promoting a healthy lifestyle, monitoring physiological parameters, facilitating treatment for various conditions, and post-operative monitoring. AI in diagnostics is already aiding in earlier diagnosis and triage in emergency rooms, facilitating the diagnosis of certain genetic syndromes, and enabling the earlier detection of neonatal sepsis, among other areas in pediatrics. Innovations in pediatric vaccinations, utilizing novel technology, have made vaccines less painful and led to the development of new vaccines for conditions such as RSV, one of the viruses causing respiratory distress in newborns during the winter. Mental Health care in pediatrics has helped in reducing stigma and improving access to care for behavioral health counselling for conditions like depression and anxiety, using a smartphone app. Pediatric surgery has seen substantial progress in minimally invasive procedures, which help reduce post-operative pain, minimize tissue damage, decrease recovery time, and minimize scarring. Pediatric care now emphasizes addressing social determinants of health like housing, income, emotional support, food insecurity, and stressors in a child's life, which helps in timely referrals."
41357484,Prognostic utility of procalcitonin and lactate clearance for in-hospital mortality in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a significant global health burden and a leading cause of in-hospital mortality. Recent research has focused on the prognostic value of biomarker kinetics, particularly clearance rates and inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio. This study aimed to compare the utility of procalcitonin and lactate clearance in predicting in-hospital mortality among septic patients and to identify an optimal procalcitonin clearance (PCTc) cut-off to differentiate survivors from non-survivors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented with sepsis or septic shock to a tertiary care ED in Lebanon between November 2018 and March 2024. Procalcitonin and lactate readings were recorded along with demographics, comorbidities and therapeutic interventions. PCTc and lactate clearance were calculated as percentage change between the first and second readings, and lactate clearance was considered positive if > 10%. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included ED, ICU and hospital length of stay. ROC curve was used to assess prognostic accuracy of biomarkers and derive an optimal PCTc cutoff. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the association of in-hospital mortality with lactate and procalcitonin clearances. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-four patients with sepsis and septic shock were included. Mean age was 71.4 +/- 16.5 years with male predominance (55.4%). Optimal cutoff for PCTc was found to be 23.1% (94.0% sensitivity, 7.0% specificity). Patients were then stratified based on lactate and procalcitonin clearances above and below the cutoffs to compare baseline parameters, interventions and outcomes. Patients with lactate clearance > 10 had significantly lower rates of chronic kidney disease (p = 0.006), congestive heart failure (p = 0.02), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.04). Only CRP showed a statistically significant difference with respect to PCTc. Therapeutic interventions were similar in both PCTc groups and lactate clearance groups except for 24-h IV fluid administration (p = 0.04). Mortality was significantly associated with lactate clearance > 10 (p = 0.045) but not with PCTc (p = 0.65). The area under the ROC curve was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.34-0.45, p = 0.56) for lactate clearance, 0.39 (95% CI: 0.33-0.45, p = 0.56) for PCTc and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.46-0.56, p = 0.67) for NLR, with a significant difference among the AUCs (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a borderline significant association of in-hospital mortality with lactate clearance (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.42-1.04, p = 0.07) but not with procalcitonin clearance (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.43-2.95, p = 0.81). Vasopressor use was associated with reduced odds of death, while steroid use was independently associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Lactate clearance with 10% cutoff is a better predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the ED with sepsis or septic shock compared to PCTc. An optimal PCTc cutoff of 23.1% was identified; however, it did not reach statistical significance for survival. Future prospective studies are needed to better define optimal biomarker cutoffs and compare their predictive accuracy for in-hospital mortality."
41357433,Transforming critical care: the digital revolution's impact on intensive care units.,2025,"Intensive care units (ICUs) represent a critical pillar of modern healthcare, combining advanced technologies and specialized care to support organ functions in critically ill patients. The recent COVID pandemic served not only as a stress test but also as a potential catalyst for further ICU digitalization advancements. Recently evolved tools and processes suggest a transformative potential for digitalization in enhancing ICU performance, optimizing resource utilization, and improving patient outcomes. Digital tools-particularly machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-could significantly support ICU care by facilitating real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and semiautomated decision-making. ML models have shown promise in outperforming traditional scoring systems when predicting patient outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay, and readmission risks. The digitalization of nursing documentation and resource allocation processes appears to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and potentially optimize staff time for direct patient care. Innovations in infection control are increasingly leveraging AI to predict conditions like ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis, enabling earlier interventions and potentially enhancing antimicrobial stewardship. Closed-loop ventilation systems illustrate a shift toward intelligent, data-responsive care platforms that may improve patient safety and therapeutic precision by embedding adaptive decision-making into medical devices. The pandemic underscored the growing relevance of ICU digitalization, accelerating the development of tools such as remote monitoring, tele-ICU models, and wearable devices. These advancements have helped address unprecedented patient volumes and further illustrated the potential of AI-enabled tools to streamline ICU workflows and augment patient care. This momentum reflects a broader paradigm shift in critical care toward more proactive, algorithm-assisted medicine-where AI is positioned to complement clinical judgment in managing the complexity of ICU environments. In addition, personalized digital recovery pathways are being explored to support post-ICU rehabilitation, although significant challenges remain in addressing patients' physical and psychological recovery needs. Altogether, these recent evolutions underscore the potentially transforming role of digitalization in enhancing ICU care quality and safety parameters, improving resource utilization, supporting better patient outcomes, and helping meet the evolving expectations of patients and their families."
41357343,Personalized Fluid Management in Patients With Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury: A Casual Machine Learning Approach.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: IV fluids are the cornerstone for management of acute kidney injury (AKI) after sepsis but can cause fluid overload. A restrictive fluid strategy may benefit some patients; however, identifying them is challenging. Novel causal machine learning (ML) techniques can estimate heterogenous treatment effects (HTEs) of IV fluids among these patients. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a causal-ML framework to identify patients who benefit from restrictive fluids (< 500 mL fluids within 24 hr after AKI). DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective study among patients with sepsis who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) within 48 hours of ICU admission. We developed a causal-ML approach to estimate individualized treatment effects and guide fluid therapy. We developed the model in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and externally validated it in Salzburg Intensive Care database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our primary outcome was early AKI reversal at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included sustained AKI reversal and major adverse kidney events by 30 days (MAKE30). Model performance to identify HTE of restrictive IV fluids was assessed using the area under the targeting operator characteristic curve (AUTOC), which quantifies how well a model captures HTE, and compared with a random forest model. RESULTS: Causal forest model outperformed random forest in identifying HTE of restrictive IV fluids with AUTOC 0.15 vs. -0.02 in external validation cohort. Among 1931 patients in external validation cohort, the model recommended restrictive fluids for 68.9%. Among these, patients who received restrictive fluids demonstrated significantly higher rates of early AKI reversal (53.9% vs. 33.2%, p < 0.001), sustained AKI reversal (34.2% vs. 18.0%, p < 0.001), and lower rates of MAKE30 (17.1% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.003). Results were consistent in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Causal-ML framework outperformed random forest model in identifying patients with AKI and sepsis who benefit from restrictive fluid therapy. This provides a data-driven approach for personalized fluid management and merits prospective evaluation in clinical trials."
41357328,Shorter or biomarker-guided antibiotic durations for common serious neonatal infections: a collection of non-inferiority meta-analyses.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary antibiotic prolongation promotes antimicrobial resistance. Evidence-based guidance on antibiotic durations for treating neonatal infections is lacking. Noninferiority meta-analyses evaluating shorter durations or biomarker-guided durations have not been conducted. METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses using a unified search strategy (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, January 1990-December 2024) to determine whether short-course antibiotics are noninferior to ""standard"" courses for culture-positive sepsis, culture-negative sepsis, UTIs, uncomplicated/complicated meningitis, and fungal sepsis. Likewise, we determined whether biomarker-guided antibiotic durations are noninferior to ""standard"" courses for any sepsis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without language restriction comparing short-courses or biomarker-guided courses versus standard courses for treating the above neonatal infections. Minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for critical outcomes were pre-specified [mortality (28-day, in-hospital or 12-month corrected age) = +1%, culture-positive relapse = +3%, culture-negative relapse = +5%]. We evaluated risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0) and certainty of evidence (CoE) using GRADE. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023311895. FINDINGS: We reviewed 146 full-text articles and included 26 in the review. For culture-positive sepsis (7 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), 7-10-day courses were noninferior to longer courses for 28-day mortality [upper bound of 95% CI for risk difference +0.85%, below 1% MCID (low CoE)], in-hospital mortality [+0.51% (moderate CoE)], culture-positive relapse [+0.75%, below 3% MCID (low CoE)], culture-negative relapse [+4.7%, below 5% MCID (very low CoE)]. For culture-negative and -positive sepsis, biomarker-guided courses (5 RCTs) were noninferior to standard courses for mortality and relapses (all very low CoE). For culture-negative sepsis (6 RCTs), shorter courses (3-4 days) were noninferior for culture-positive relapses (very low CoE) but not noninferior for other outcomes (low to very low CoE). Conclusions could not be drawn for UTI (6 observational studies) or meningitis (1 RCT). There were no data for complicated meningitis and fungal sepsis. INTERPRETATION: Compared to standard durations, 7-10-day antibiotic courses and biomarker-guided courses may be noninferior for treating culture-positive neonatal sepsis and any sepsis, respectively. Three-to-four-day courses may not be noninferior for culture-negative sepsis. Given the low to very low CoE, these conclusions are not definitive. No conclusions can be drawn for UTIs, meningitis, and fungal sepsis. FUNDING: Not funded."
41356931,Gastric Balloon Complication Mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Case Report.,2025,"Although intragastric balloons are a common endoscopic bariatric therapy, they carry a risk of complications, including obstruction and intolerance, which can lead to severe dehydration and metabolic disturbances. We present the case of a 40-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and hypertension who presented to the emergency department with chest pain, abdominal pain, and repeated vomiting one month after gastric balloon insertion. Her initial workup was concerning for acute coronary syndrome, with EKG showing inferolateral ST-T depressions and a positive troponin. Further evaluation revealed severe acute kidney injury, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed sepsis and acute kidney injury due to severe dehydration from a suspected gastric outlet obstruction secondary to the balloon. Management involved fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, antibiotic therapy, and urgent endoscopic removal of the gastric balloon. Following removal, the patient's symptoms, EKG changes, and laboratory abnormalities resolved completely. This case highlights a critical diagnostic pitfall: metabolic and renal sequelae of gastric balloon complications can mimic non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, potentially leading to misdirected care. A high index of suspicion for non-cardiac causes is essential in patients with bariatric devices to ensure timely and correct intervention."
41356639,Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome on Chronic Trifluoperazine Therapy: A Diagnostic Dilemma.,2025,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic medication. This report describes the case of a 62-year-old male with chronic trifluoperazine use who presented with fever, rigidity, and altered mental status. Although sepsis or meningoencephalitis was initially suspected, an elevated creatine kinase and fulfillment of Levenson's criteria confirmed the diagnosis of NMS. The patient's condition improved following supportive care, administration of bromocriptine, and lorazepam. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of NMS in patients on a stable antipsychotic regimen and underscores the importance of early recognition, particularly after excluding infectious etiologies."
41356079,Muscle matters: Transforming the care of intensive care unit acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis.,2025,"Intensive care unit (ICU) acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis are increasingly recognized complications of critical illness, characterized by a rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and function. These conditions result from a complex interplay of systemic inflammation, immobilization, catabolic stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often culminating in impaired recovery, prolonged hospitalization, and increased long-term mortality. First identified in survivors of sepsis and prolonged mechanical ventilation, these muscle abnormalities were initially described using computed tomography-based assessments of muscle area and density. Subsequent advances in imaging, biomarker discovery, and functional testing have enabled earlier detection and risk stratification across diverse ICU populations. While nutritional optimization and early mobilization form the cornerstone of current prevention and treatment strategies, the emergence of novel approaches, including automated artificial intelligence-based screening, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and targeted pharmacologic therapies, has broadened the clinical scope of interventions. Despite their significant prognostic implications, ICU-acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis remain under-recognized in routine critical care practice. This mini-review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding their pathophysiology, available diagnostic modalities, prognostic relevance, and the evolving landscape of therapeutic strategies for long-term functional recovery in critically ill patients."
41355990,Direct detection of Gram-negative bacilli and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers in positive blood culture specimens using MALDI-TOF MS.,2025,"Bloodstream infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are often difficult to treat. Here, we investigated the performance of a workflow for direct detection of Gram-negative bacilli and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in positive blood culture (PBC) specimens using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Samples were prepared from spiked and clinical PBC specimens using a sample preparation kit, and bacterial identification and cephalosporinase activity assays were performed using MALDI-TOF MS. The results were compared with those obtained using the conventional method, which was performed for colonies as routine microbiological testing. Of the 34 spiked PBC specimens prepared using Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, all 27 ESBL producers tested positive and seven non-producers tested negative for cephalosporinase activity. Of the 111 clinical PBC specimens analyzed, 99 (89.2%) showed concordance with the conventional method results, with scores >/= 2.00. Among the 54 Enterobacterales, consisting of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis isolates identified in the directly prepared samples, 14 were ESBL producers in the colonies. Of the 14 ESBL producers, 11 (78.6%) were correctly identified as cephalosporinase producers in the directly prepared samples using MALDI-TOF MS. The time required for direct identification (8.4 h) was significantly shorter than that required for conventional identification (15.0 h). Moreover, the time required for cephalosporinase activity detection in the directly prepared samples (9.2 h) was significantly shorter than that required for phenotypic ESBL detection in colonies (32.3 h). This study demonstrates the performance of the workflow for direct detection of Gram-negative bacilli and cephalosporinase activity in ESBL producers from PBC specimens using MALDI-TOF MS."
41354694,Value of red blood cell distribution width in evaluating 2019-nCoV infection in neonates: a retrospective study.,2025,"Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) can be employed to prognosticate the outcome of adult patients infected with 2019-nCoV and to appraise the efficacy of treatments for neonatal sepsis. Nevertheless, its utilization in neonates infected with 2019-nCoV remains unexplored. In this research, we examine the association between RDW and 2019-nCoV infection in neonates and its potential as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy. The clinical and laboratory data of neonates diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection or sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of two hospitals were gathered and retrospectively analyzed via a sample t-test. The RDW of the neonatal 2019-nCoV infection group was lower than that of the neonatal sepsis group (P < 0.05). In each group, the RDW following treatment was lower than that before treatment (P < 0.05). These outcomes suggest that the alterations in RDW in neonates with 2019-nCoV infection exhibit smaller overall fluctuations compared to those with neonatal sepsis. However, they are equally effective in evaluating treatment efficacy, with notable improvement detected after therapy. Our discoveries broaden the application of RDW in neonates with 2019-nCoV infection and imply that the dynamic changes in RDW can be utilized to assess the therapeutic effect."
41354236,"A cluster of 11 cases of Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia in Kyoto, Japan.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes infection, known as listeriosis, is relatively uncommon. However, in elderly or immunocompromised patients, it can lead to severe manifestations such as meningitis and bacteremia, making it a clinically important disease. The primary route of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food, and since a wide range of food items may be involved, close collaboration with public health authorities is essential for effective source identification. CASE REPORT: We encountered 11 cases of Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia within a limited region over the course of one month. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the isolates were highly genetically related. Notably, the patients resided in different municipalities, suggesting exposure to a widely distributed food source. However, under the current Japanese legal framework, bacteremia is not a notifiable condition, which hindered timely identification of the infection source. CONCLUSION: This case series underscores challenges in both clinical practice and the public health system in Japan, highlighting how such rare, genetically related clusters of bacteremia, occurring within a short period and across multiple municipalities, can easily be overlooked under the current surveillance framework."
41354184,Prognostic assessment of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in older patients using clinical and CT-based radiomic features.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (SI-ARDS) is associated with high mortality rates, necessitating early risk stratification. This study aimed to develop and validate a radiomics-based nomogram integrating computed tomography (CT) features and clinical parameters to predict 28-day mortality in older patients with SI-ARDS. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 302 older patients (>/=60 years) diagnosed with SI-ARDS between January 2019 and December 2023 were enrolled. Radiomic features were extracted from admission chest CT images. Patients were randomly allocated to training (n = 242) and validation (n = 60) cohorts. Three predictive models-radiomic, clinical, and combined-were constructed using Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) algorithm and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. A nomogram was developed based on the optimal model for clinical application. RESULTS: The fusion model achieved superior discrimination compared with the radiomic model, clinical model, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in both cohorts (C-index: training, 0.850 vs. 0.798, 0.781, and 0.654; validation, 0.839 vs. 0.768, 0.779, and 0.696; all p < 0.001). The model demonstrated excellent calibration and provided greater net clinical benefit across threshold probabilities of 10 %-90 %. Risk stratification using the nomogram identified distinct prognostic groups with significantly different 28-day survival (log-rank p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed from the fusion model demonstrated superior predictive performance for 28-day mortality in older patients with SI-ARDS compared to conventional scoring systems, though multicenter validation is required to confirm clinical utility."
41354009,Optimizing sepsis care within a learning health system: qualitatively examining the perspectives of those involved in sepsis care.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Improving early recognition and treatment of sepsis is key to decreasing patient mortality. The current study investigates barriers and facilitators to timely and appropriate sepsis care from the perspectives of care team members across different roles at a large academic health system. METHODS: We held focus groups with frontline staff involved with sepsis care grouped by roles, including nurses, physicians, residents, pharmacists, laboratory staff, and members of an interdisciplinary sepsis rapid response team. Surveys were distributed to participants unable to attend a focus group session. Two researchers independently coded interview transcripts and survey responses, and mapped codes onto the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Twenty-two frontline staff participated in seven focus groups; six others completed supplementary surveys. We identified eighteen factors influencing sepsis care across four themes: (1) sepsis detection; (2) approach to sepsis care; (3) team dynamics; (4) awareness of sepsis protocols, best practices, and performance. DISCUSSION: This study adds important insights on how team dynamics and environmental pressures affect sepsis care delivery. By including multiple roles in our sample, this study provides unique insight regarding how the lack of shared mental models troubles sepsis care delivery. CONCLUSION: Future efforts to optimize sepsis care should focus on assessing team dynamics and developing interventions to improve these shared understandings and communication across roles."
41353904,Prediction of weaning in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients using interpretable machine learning methods.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Weaning from mechanical ventilation remains a critical challenge in intensive care units. Machine learning has shown potential in supporting clinical decisions during this process. OBJECTIVE: Sepsis frequently leads to ALI/ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation. However, with evolving definitions of weaning, many existing predictive models have become outdated. This study aimed to develop a predictive model based on the standardized WIND framework to accurately predict successful weaning in septic patients under current clinical practices. METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV database were analyzed. Univariate analysis identified risk factors for extubation outcomes, and feature selection was performed using LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Predictive models, including XGB, RF, and GBM, were evaluated based on AUC and F1 score. SHAP values were used to assess feature importance. RESULTS: A total of 3774 patients were included. Univariate analysis showed that the failed weaning group had longer ICU stays, higher ventilator settings, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, creatinine, SOFA scores, lactate, and platelet count (P < 0.05). Feature selection reduced 46 variables to 12 key predictors. The XGB model performed best, with AUC values of 0.849, 0.838, and 0.825 for the training, internal, and external cohorts, respectively. SHAP analysis identified mean airway pressure, ICU length of stay, and lactate as the most influential predictors. CONCLUSION: We developed an interpretable, accurate XGB-based model to predict weaning outcomes in septic patients."
41353678,CMKLR1 as a Therapeutic Target: Vitamin D-Mediated Suppression of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in SA-AKI.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe complication of sepsis, primarily driven by immune-inflammatory dysregulation and oxidative stress, and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) shows renoprotective potential, yet its molecular targets and mechanisms remain unclear. Transcriptomic data of SA-AKI from GEO were analyzed by ssGSEA for immune infiltration, differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning (LASSO, SVM-RFE, Random Forest) to identify the biomarkers. In vivo, SA-AKI was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3,) and renal function, histology, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and CMKLR1 expression were evaluated. In vitro, LPS-stimulated HK-2 cells were treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) with or without CMKLR1 overexpression to assess cytokines, cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Four key biomarkers-CMKLR1, COL1A1, RPS19, and THBS1-were identified by machine learning, with CMKLR1 as the key target. In SA-AKI mice, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) downregulated CMKLR1, improved renal function, and reduced inflammation and oxidative stress. In LPS-stimulated HK-2 cells, it dose-dependently suppressed cytokine release, restored cell viability, and alleviated oxidative stress, while CMKLR1 overexpression partially reversed these effects. CMKLR1 was identified as a key immune inflammation target in SA-AKI. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was protected against renal injury by suppressing CMKLR1, and mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, while CMKLR1 overexpression partially reversed these effects. These findings highlight CMKLR1 as a potential therapeutic target for SA-AKI."
41353590,Validating pancreatic stone protein for early sepsis detection and outcome prediction in community acquired infections: evidence from a tertiary medical centre.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) plasma levels has been proven effective in predicting unfavourable outcomes in patients with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), infection after cardiothoracic surgery and peritonitis. It is also being studied as a sepsis biomarker with promising results compared to other commonly used biomarkers. We aim to validate PSP in septic patients with community acquired infections. This will help to establish its role in point-of-care settings. METHODS: Adult patients consecutively admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary medical centre, with the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection (IAI), urinary tract infection (UTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. PSP was measured in whole blood, within one hour since admission, by spectrophotometry using abioSCOPE device. Statistical analysis was performed, and a cut-off value for PSP to predict the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need for invasive treatment was estimated. Patients were followed for 28 days to document their outcomes. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and one (n = 101) patients were included. Forty-five were male. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (33%). Fifty-three (52.5%) had LRTI, thirty-seven (36.6%) had UTI and nineteen (18.8%) had IAI. Thirteen of them had more than one type of infection. Our primary outcome met statistical significance, as PSP predicted the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need of invasive treatment with an Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.844 (95% CI 0.767-0.920), in the optimal cut-off of 48.5 ng/ml. PSP predicted sepsis with an AUC = 0.892 (95% CI 0.826-0.956) and was also an independent risk factor for sepsis and mortality after age adjustment. PSP was superior to the common used sepsis biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogonase (LDH)/albumin ratio, White Blood Cell count (WBC), fibrinogen and lactate both for sepsis and for the composite outcome. It was also correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) day 1 (D1), SOFA peak and qSOFA and its prognostic value was independent of renal function, despite being inversely proportional to estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), reflecting the sepsis-related acute kidney injury (SAKI). CONCLUSIONS: PSP is a valuable biomarker that can rule out patients who do not have sepsis and are not in high risk to develop sepsis the following days, giving valuable insights regarding their antimicrobial coverage and management in general. It seems to be superior to other biomarkers in sepsis prediction and adequately compatible with frequently used sepsis assessment scores, such as SOFA. In the Emergency Department setting PSP can distinguish infected patients at high risk for sepsis who have low qSOFA scores."
41353525,Outcomes and antimicrobial usage in preterm neonates < 34 weeks gestation with culture-negative neonatal sepsis: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Culture-negative sepsis (CNNS) constitutes a significant proportion of neonates admitted to the NICU. However, the outcomes and factors influencing antimicrobial therapy in this group remain understudied. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled preterm neonates (<34 weeks' gestation) with clinical features of sepsis, with or without sepsis screen positive results. Primary outcome was a composite of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment, Intraventricular haemorrhage >/= 2 and periventricular leukomalacia. Details of antimicrobial therapy were also collected. RESULTS: Over an 18-month period, 172 neonates were enrolled. 104 had CNNS and 68 had culture-positive sepsis (CPNS). Primary outcome was observed in 19 (18.3%) neonates with CNNS and 25 (36.8%) with CPNS, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.22-1.12, p = 0.095). Except for BPD, which was significantly lower in CNNS (aOR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02-0.52, p = 0.006), there was no statistically significant difference in other outcomes between groups. Multidrug-resistant organisms comprised 67.6% of the gram-negative bacterial isolates. Median (IQR) cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy was 5 (3-7) days in CNNS and 20.5 (15-24.3) days in CPNS. Prolonged cumulative antibiotic use was observed in 50 (48%) CNNS neonates (>5 days) and 50 (73.5%) CPNS neonates (>14 days). In CNNS group, 38 (36.5%) received second-line antibiotics, and 6 (5.7%) received third-line antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In preterm neonates, composite outcome of mortality and major morbidities did not differ significantly between those with CNNS and CPNS. However, a considerable proportion of CNNS neonates received a prolonged course of higher antibiotics. Thus, there is a need for strategies to improve clinical outcomes and strengthen adherence to antibiotic stewardship principles."
41353473,Novel graph-based centralized and decentralized approaches for early AKI prediction.,2025,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening problem for hospitalized patients, and early detection is crucial to reduce severe outcomes. Traditional predictive methods lack in monitoring complex physiological patterns and ensuring data privacy in decentralized healthcare settings. The study aims to develop and evaluate two distinctly complementary novel graph-based approaches, namely the centralized Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the decentralized model, Gossip Learning with Adaptive Aggregation GAT (GL-AA-GAT), to identify AKI onset between 6 and 12 h in advance, using physiological time-series data from the Kaggle Sepsis dataset. Multi-Head Attention is used for modeling feature interactions in centralized GAT, while GL-AA-GAT can further achieve this by decentralized training of five nodes using gossip exchange and adaptive aggregation for privacy and scalability. Through its novel graph structure, centralized GAT predicts the onset of AKI with an accuracy of 94.1%, sensitivity of 94%, AUC-ROC of 95%, and AUPRC of 91%. With decentralized privacy additions, GL-AA-GAT achieves an accuracy of 92.8%, a sensitivity of 93%, an AUC-ROC of 93.8%, and an AUPRC of 90%, with robustness. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the performance was stable with the prediction horizons and correlation thresholds, and external validation on non-sepsis cohorts of the ICU further indicated generalizability. Both models outperform existing models, which means high predictive reliability. The GL-AA-GAT's distributed approach gives privacy and flexibility, making it innovative for distributed clinical environments, with task scheduling enhancing training efficiency."
41353333,Treatment of bronchobiliary fistula: a 13-year experience.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is a rare but fatal disease. Due to its rarity, only a limited number of cases have been reported, leading to a lack of consensus on appropriate treatment strategies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 17 patients diagnosed with BBF between January 1, 2012, and May 30, 2025, focusing on the the presenting symptoms, diagnostic approaches, treatment modalities, and outcomes. RESULTS: All 17 patients had cough and pathognomonic biliptysis. Sputum analysis confirmed bile components in all samples from 3 patients, and fiber bronchoscopy revealed yellow-green bilious sputum in 6 patients. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated communication between the bile duct and the bronchial tree in 9 patients. Cholangiography showed contrast medium passing through a fistulous tract into the bronchi in 10 patients. Surgical intervention was performed in 6 patients, 3 of whom achieved long-term survival (> 24 months). Minimally invasive interventions provided effective symptomatic palliation in 10 of 11 patients. Among these 10 patients, 3 achieved long-term survival (> 24 months), with an additional 3 remaining alive and under ongoing follow-up (though not yet reaching the 24-month threshold). Of the 8 fatalities, 2 were directly attributed to uncontrolled BBF and its complications (sepsis or hepatic failure). The remaining deaths resulted from progressive malignancy (n = 3), postoperative complications (pneumothorax/respiratory failure, n = 1; hemorrhagic shock/disseminated intravascular coagulation, n = 1), and post-transplant septic shock (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: BBF is associated with poor prognosis. Minimally invasive therapies offer effective palliation in malignant cases, whereas surgical intervention may provide curative potential in selected benign cases. Individualized, multidisciplinary management is essential for optimizing outcomes."
41352755,Eggerthella lenta: A rare cause of septic shock and sepsis after Fournier's gangrene.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Eggerthella lenta is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus and a part of the healthy human intestinal microbial community. E. lenta causes local infections, such as sinusitis, appendicitis, necrotizing fascitis, cutaneous abscesses, and liver abscesses. DESIGN OR METHODS: This case report details an instance of sepsis attributable to Eggerthella lenta bacteremia in a 78-year-old male patient recently diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene. The management strategy included an escalation of antibiotic therapy from piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem, which successfully resolved the sepsis and eradicated the bacteremia. The patient developed Fournier's gangrene, necessitating surgical intervention, but subsequently experienced septic shock and was diagnosed with an E. lenta infection. CONCLUSION: The patient underwent surgery with antimicrobial therapy, made a good recovery and was discharged after a 24-day hospital admission."
41351947,Nursing shortages and patient outcomes.,2026,"This paper examines the effect of nurse shortages on healthcare production. Employing novel high-frequency data, we examine what effect the absence of nursing staff has on inpatient mortality and other outcomes associated with nursing care. We find significant adverse mortality impacts of shortages of nurses with degree-level qualifications: for the average ward, the absence of a nurse with university degree-equivalent level training increases the odds of a patient death by approximately 10%, while there is no effect of shortages of less qualified nursing assistants. For qualified nurses, there are returns to firm (hospital) specific human capital: increasing the average firm-specific experience among degree qualified nurses by one year is associated with an 8% reduction in the odds of a patient death, the equivalent to adding three-quarters of an extra qualified nurse to the ward. Adverse mortality impacts of shortages are particularly concentrated among patients of relatively low, rather than high, clinical severity. The largest impacts are for those diagnosed with sepsis, a condition where early detection is important for survival and where nurses have a central role in detection and subsequent control."
41351215,"Association between FAR, PAR, APRI and adverse neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by intrahepatic cholestasis.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR), platelet/albumin ratio (PAR), and AST/platelet ratio (APRI) in identifying poor neonatal outcomes among pregnancies complicated by IHCP. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study included 165 pregnant women diagnosed with IHCP and 155 healthy pregnant women matched for age and gestational age, who delivered at a tertiary care hospital between January 2023 and January 2025. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and perinatal characteristics were reviewed. FAR, PAR, and APRI were calculated from standard laboratory data. A composite poor neonatal outcome was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: Apgar score <7 at 5 min, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), meconium aspiration, neonatal sepsis, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: FAR and APRI values were significantly higher in the IHCP group compared to controls (p<0.05). Among neonates with adverse outcomes, only FAR levels were significantly elevated (p = 0.015). However, its discriminative ability was limited (AUC = 0.607; sensitivity: 58 %, specificity: 63 %) and it was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: FAR and APRI levels are elevated in pregnancies with IHCP, yet FAR alone demonstrates limited predictive value for adverse neonatal outcomes. It may serve as a supportive, rather than standalone, marker. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted."
41351151,Splenic abscess caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis septicemia: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The spleen is a vital immune organ in the human body that is involved in both cellular and humoral immunity. It has unique physiological functions that contribute to fighting infections, and typically, infections do not lead to the formation of splenic abscesses, making them rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old healthy female presented with high fever, chills, and abdominal pain after tooth extraction. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed splenic infection and multiple abscesses. Porphyromonas gingivalis was identified by blood culture and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Percutaneous drainage was not used because of the multiple abscesses and high risk of bleeding, and she eventually recovered well with antibiotic treatments. CONCLUSION: We report a case of splenic abscess caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis septicemia. It should be suspected even in healthy adults with high fever and abdominal pain after undergoing oral manipulation."
41350942,Infection risks and biopsy-associated complications in prostate cancer diagnosis: a review of recent literatures.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Prostate biopsy, essential for definitive diagnosis, has evolved significantly with new technologies and techniques. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-Bx) has been the gold standard but carries substantial infectious risks due to rectal mucosal penetration. Rising antibiotic resistance, emerging safety protocols, and novel imaging-guided methods have driven a shift toward safer alternatives. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed and PubMed Central for studies published between 2014 and 2025 on prostate puncture complications. Eligible articles included original studies with >/=2 patients, emphasizing infectious complications, antibiotic prophylaxis, and modern innovations. From 639 records screened, 78 met inclusion criteria. Thematic synthesis was used to classify findings into complication types, prophylaxis approaches, and technological advancements. RESULTS: Infectious complications after TRUS-Bx ranged from 0.5 to 9.4% for sepsis and 0.3 to 4.9% for febrile urinary tract infections, largely driven by multidrug-resistant organisms and increased sampling density. Transperineal biopsy (TP-Bx), bypassing rectal flora, consistently reported infection rates <1%. Targeted prophylaxis based on rectal cultures, combination antibiotic regimens (e.g., fluoroquinolone with fosfomycin or ceftriaxone), and adjunct measures such as rectal cleansing significantly reduced post-biopsy infections. Technological innovations such as MRI-ultrasound fusion, robotic-assisted approaches, and PSMA PET/CT-guided techniques improved cancer detection rates (up to 71.8%) while maintaining low complication rates ( < 5%). Emerging non-antibiotic TP protocols and advanced anesthetic techniques further enhanced safety and patient tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Modern evidence supports a paradigm shift toward TP-Bx combined with targeted or multidrug prophylaxis to mitigate infectious risks. Imaging-guided and robotic-assisted techniques enhance diagnostic accuracy and safety but remain limited in resource-constrained settings. TRUS-Bx retains utility where TP access is unavailable; however, adapting infection prevention strategies is critical. Future large-scale trials and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to optimize biopsy protocols globally."
41350846,Nationwide trends and disparities in deaths following cardiogenic shock and sepsis in the United States (1999-2023): insights from the CDC WONDER database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) with sepsis is a highly fatal condition, yet national mortality trends and demographic disparities in these co-occurring conditions remain poorly characterized. METHODS: We analyzed CDC WONDER Multiple Cause of Death data (1999-2023) to identify adult deaths involving both CS and sepsis. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs), crude mortality rates (CMRs), average annual percent change (AAPC), and annual percent change (APC) by period were calculated and stratified by sex, race, age, census region, urbanization, and state. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2023, 59,898 deaths were recorded, overwhelmingly in inpatient medical facilities (94.61%). The national AAMR rose from 0.65 (1999) to 2.01 (2023), with an overall AAPC of 5.39 (95% CI: 4.24-6.56, p < 0.001). Mortality was higher in males (AAMR: 1.28; AAPC: 5.20) compared to females (AAMR: 0.78; AAPC: 5.35). NH Black or African American individuals had the highest AAMR (1.69), followed by Hispanic (0.98), and NH White (0.93). Older adults had the greatest CMR (3.51), compared with middle-aged (0.77) and young adults (0.12). By region, AAMR was highest in the South (1.06) and Northeast (1.05), lower in the Midwest (0.84), and lowest in the West (0.10). Non-metropolitan areas had higher AAMR (0.89; AAPC: 6.34) compared with metropolitan areas (0.86; AAPC: 4.78). States with the highest burden included Rhode Island, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Connecticut. CONCLUSION: Mortality from CS with sepsis increased significantly over two decades, with pronounced disparities across sex, race, age, and geography. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted national strategies."
41350822,Management of malaria in newborns: a systematic review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Malaria in neonates (age </= 28 days) remains under-recognized and poorly characterized, without specific management guidelines. We conducted a systematic review to collate available evidence on antimalarial treatment in this age group. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies reporting confirmed Plasmodium spp. infection and antimalarial treatment in neonates. Any type of study with original data, including case reports, was included if published in English, German or French. Demographic, clinical and antimalarial treatment data were extracted and summarized descriptively. RESULTS: Out of 4028 reports identified, 26 publications (22 case reports, three case series, one cross-sectional study) reporting on antimalarial treatment in 40 neonates with confirmed malaria were included. The majority (75%) of publications originated from malaria-endemic regions with 19 cases reported from African countries. Median age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 16 and 19 days, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax accounted for 45% and 43% of cases, one case had a P. falciparum and P. vivax co-infection, and in four cases species of Plasmodium was not reported. All but one neonate were reported with symptomatic malaria, with fever, jaundice, and anaemia as predominating symptoms; 70% were initially misdiagnosed with sepsis. Treatment regimens varied substantially. Of neonates with P. falciparum malaria, only 28% received artemisinin-based therapy and most (56%) were treated with oral amodiaquine or chloroquine monotherapy. P. vivax malaria was mostly treated with oral chloroquine (64%). Oral drug administration practice was rarely reported but included drug administration as syrup or crushed tablets and use of an orogastric tube. All patients survived, with reported parasitaemia clearance in 2-7 days. CONCLUSION: The literature on newborn malaria management remains notably sparse. Reported management practices are highly inconsistent with regimens deviating from current treatment recommendations. Prospective interventional studies on the management of malaria in newborns, including evaluation of oral drug administration practices and pharmacokinetics are urgently needed to inform evidence-based age-specific guidelines. CLINICAL TRIAL: Not applicable. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-12230-5."
41350624,Identification of sepsis pyroptosis-related genes based on single-cell sequencing technology and experimental verification.,2025,"This study aimed to screen for new biomarkers for sepsis. Firstly, peripheral blood samples from 23 sepsis patients and 10 healthy volunteers were collected according to the sepsis 3.0 criteria and analyzed by RNA-seq. A total of 876 pyroptosis-related genes were sourced from the Genecards database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was then employed to pinpoint genes linked to sepsis clinical modules significantly associated with the phenotype. An intersection analysis with pyroptosis-related genes was conducted, resulting in the identification of 60 common genes. Then, two core genes (BCL6 and JAK2) were jointly identified using three types of machine learning: random forest, SVM, and Lasso regression. Expression analysis showed that both were significantly highly expressed in the sepsis group, and the subject work characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that their diagnostic efficacies were high in both of them in the multiple datasets (AUC value > 0.88), and meta-analysis revealed their correlation with the prognostic status of sepsis patients, and GSEA analysis showed that BCL6 was mainly enriched in metabolism-related pathways, while JAK2 was significantly involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, immune infiltration analysis showed that BCL6 and JAK2 were closely associated with the infiltration of a variety of immune cells, suggesting their potential functions in regulating the immune microenvironment. Finally, single-cell sequencing localization showed that BCL6 and JAK2 were mainly distributed in macrophages and B cells. Mendelian Randomization Analysis Suggests BCL6, JAK2 Expression Levels May Influence the Risk of Sepsis. The experimental results verified the expression status of key genes. Clinical trial number for this study: ChiCTR1900021261 Registration date: February 4, 2019. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12865-025-00785-6."
41350026,Long QT Syndrome With KCNH2/SCN5A Dual Gene Mutation Leading to Electrical Storm.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic ion channel abnormality characterized by a long QT interval and torsades de pointes. Torsades de pointes can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, and stressful conditions such as infections can be an acquired trigger of malignant arrhythmias. LQTS due to compound genetic mutations are clinically rare, and its diagnosis and therapy are challenging and require a multidisciplinary comprehensive intervention. CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old man presented with malignant arrhythmia and shock, triple-vessel coronary artery disease, dual LQT mutations (KCNH2/LQT2 and SCN5A/LQT3), and Gram-negative sepsis. The arrhythmia was successfully controlled by means of emergency defibrillation, temporary pacing, anti-infective therapy, and ultimately the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. DISCUSSION: In this patient, the double gene mutations KCNH2 and SCN5A caused LQTS, which caused electrical storm and mixed shock under infectious stress. Based on the electrocardiographic changes, the dynamic evolution of troponin levels, and genetic testing, LQTS was a more plausible etiology than acute coronary syndrome. An integrated multimodal strategy was used: anti-infective therapy, temporary pacing to shorten the QT interval, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. This case highlights the value of genetic diagnosis of complex arrhythmias and the need for acute-phase trigger control and long-term treatment. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: When managing malignant arrhythmias, hereditary channelopathies and infections need to be considered as significant causes. Genetic testing plays an important role in diagnosis, risk assessment, and family management."
41348679,Red blood cell to platelet ratio and its trajectory as prognostic factors for patients with gastrointestinal tract perforation and abdominal sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis after emergency gastrointestinal perforation surgery increases costs and hospital stay. Early diagnosis and management are vital. This study assesses the prognostic value of the red blood cell to platelet ratio (RPR) in these patients with abdominal sepsis. METHOD: Clinical data from MIMIC-IV and a hospital validation set were retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, comorbidities, and lab indices were extracted; missing values were imputed using random forest. RPR's dynamic changes and relation to prognosis were analyzed using latent category trajectory modeling. Prognostic factors were screened via Lasso-Cox regression to build column-line graph models. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests, and restricted cubic splines analyzed RPR-outcome associations. R 4.2.3 was used; P < 0.05 was significant. RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were enrolled in MIMIC-IV and 253 patients were enrolled in the hospital. RPR was a significant prognostic indicator. Elevated RPR correlated with coagulation dysfunction (increased PT/INR, decreased fibrinogen) and higher mortality risk. Trajectory analysis identified two RPR patterns; Class 1 had significantly lower 28-day mortality than Class 2. The hospitalization and ICU prognostic models demonstrated good efficacy. Validation set results supported these findings, indicating dynamic RPR changes effectively assess prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The red blood cell to platelet ratio may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for abdominal septic patients, influencing clotting and kidney function."
41348586,"Nirsevimab Effectiveness Against Intensive Care Unit Admission for Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Infants - 24 States, December 2024-April 2025.",2025,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and respiratory failure among infants (children aged <1 year) in the United States. In August 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, to protect against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection among all infants aged <8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. Following licensure, nirsevimab effectiveness has been demonstrated against RSV-associated infant hospitalization, but evidence regarding effectiveness against RSV-associated critical illness is limited. In a 27-hospital case-control investigation, nirsevimab effectiveness against both RSV-associated infant ICU admission and acute respiratory failure (illness requiring continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, or invasive mechanical ventilation) after hospital admission was evaluated during December 1, 2024-April 15, 2025. Among 457 case-patients who received a positive RSV test result and 302 control patients who received a negative RSV test result admitted to an ICU with respiratory symptoms, 14% and 45%, respectively, had received nirsevimab >/=7 days before symptom onset. Nirsevimab was 80% effective (95% CI = 70%-86%) against RSV-associated ICU admission and 83% effective (95% CI = 74%-90%) against acute respiratory failure when received a median of 52 days (IQR = 32-89 days) and 50 days (IQR = 32-86 days) before onset for each respective endpoint. These estimates support the recommendation for use of nirsevimab as a prevention strategy to protect infants against severe outcomes from RSV infection."
41348239,Molecular analysis of immune cell subsets and cytokine profiles in septic Vietnamese patients.,2025,"Sepsis remains a Major global health burden, accounting for an estimated 11 million deaths annually, and is characterized by a profoundly dysregulated host immune response to infection. Despite its significant morbidity and mortality, the immunopathogenesis of sepsis-particularly within underrepresented populations-remains inadequately understood. Here we report distinct immunological signatures associated with clinical outcomes among Vietnamese septic patients. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive investigation of both cellular and cytokine immune parameters in the sepsis population. Our findings demonstrate that survivors of sepsis exhibited a higher proportion of circulating B cells, whereas non-survivors showed increased activation of T and natural killer (NK) cells, marked by elevated expression of activation molecules such as CD69 and GITR. There was a notable reduction in B cell numbers, and further phenotypic analysis revealed signs of B cell exhaustion, indicated by increased CD21low expression, as well as depletion of both memory and naive B cell subsets. Collectively, these results establish compromised humoral immunity in septic patients. T cells in septic patients displayed a skewing toward effector memory phenotypes, and NK cells demonstrated impaired cytotoxic potential, as evidenced by decreased expression of key the key activating receptors including NKG2D and DNAM-1. Concurrent cytokine profiling revealed significantly elevated concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in septic patients. A significantly diminished percentage of CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CD197(-) T cells, alongside markedly elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, was observed in non-survivors, strongly supporting their role as key prognostic biomarkers for predicting sepsis-related mortality. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels did not significantly differ between those who survived and those who did not, a result that diverges from some prior reports and highlights the possibility of population-specific immunological nuances."
41348160,Artificial Intelligence-Based Predictive Modeling for Early Detection of Sepsis in Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review evaluates artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models developed for early sepsis detection in adult hospitalized patients. It explores model types, input features, validation strategies, performance metrics, clinical integration, and implementation challenges. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL for studies published between January 2015 and March 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included those developing or validating AI models for adult inpatient sepsis prediction using electronic health record data and reporting at least one performance metric (area under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, or F1 score). Studies focusing on pediatric populations, lacking quantitative evaluation, or unpublished in peer-reviewed journals were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction followed preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Extracted variables included study design, patient population, model type, input features, validation approach, and performance outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most used retrospective designs, with limited prospective or real-time clinical validation. Commonly used algorithms included random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, and deep learning architectures (long short-term memory, convolutional neural network). Input data varied from structured sources (vital signs, laboratory values, demographics) to unstructured clinical notes processed via natural language processing. Reported AUC values ranged from 0.79 to 0.96, indicating strong predictive performance across models. CONCLUSIONS: AI models demonstrate significant promise for early sepsis detection, outperforming conventional scoring systems in many cases. However, generalizability, interpretability, and clinical implementation remain major challenges. Future research should emphasize externally validated, explainable, and scalable AI solutions integrated into real-time clinical workflows."
41347501,Phenotypic and genotypic differences between bloodstream and non-blood Candida krusei isolates: implications for invasiveness and antifungal susceptibility.,2026,"Candida krusei is an opportunistic pathogen with intrinsic resistance to fluconazole. This study analyzed 174 C. krusei isolates from bloodstream infections (BSI, n = 115) and non-blood sources (n = 59). Biochemical profiling using the VITEK 2 YST ID Card revealed a significant difference in the TyrA reaction between BSI and non-blood isolates (P < 0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing via CLSI broth microdilution and Sensititre YeastOne showed that BSI isolates were more susceptible to echinocandins and azoles than non-blood strains, with minor MIC discrepancies between methods. Microsatellite genotyping at eight loci demonstrated high genetic diversity. Notably, a cluster of respiratory isolates from COVID-19 patients suggested potential nosocomial transmission. The integration of phenotypic, susceptibility, and genotypic data highlights possible virulence traits and epidemiological patterns. These findings may support the development of tailored antifungal therapies and improved infection control, particularly for high-risk populations such as ICU and COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCEBloodstream infections caused by C. krusei are associated with high mortality rates and limited therapeutic options, emphasizing the need to better understand the factors contributing to its pathogenicity and invasive potential. This study provides critical insights into the biology and clinical impact of C. krusei. By integrating biochemical, antifungal susceptibility, and genotypic analyses of bloodstream and non-bloodstream isolates, it reveals distinct phenotypic and resistance profiles, high genetic diversity, and potential nosocomial transmission in COVID-19 patients. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing population-specific traits in C. krusei, which may guide tailored antifungal strategies and strengthen infection control measures, especially for vulnerable groups such as ICU and immunocompromised patients."
41347496,The Importance of Early Mycological Clearance of Uncomplicated Candidaemia and Its Implications for Clinical Practice.,2025,"Invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening infection associated with high morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs in both general and critical care settings. Timely diagnosis and adequate antifungal treatment are essential to improving patient outcomes and limiting unnecessary use of healthcare resources. This review explores the relationship between early Candida clearance with antifungal therapy, clinical outcomes, resistance patterns and economic impact. It also evaluates the role of diagnostic markers in facilitating early and accurate identification of candidaemia, enabling more precise and effective clinical management. Special attention is given to the challenges of managing candidaemia in critically ill and neutropenic patients, highlighting the need for tailored and timely interventions in these vulnerable populations."
41347097,Proposed observational study protocol for early differentiation of cytokine release syndrome and sepsis in CAR-T recipients with haematological malignancies using the IL-6/PCT ratio: the DRACARYS study.,2025,"Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionised treatment for haematological malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in B-cell leukaemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. However, severe toxicities-particularly Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and sepsis-present significant clinical challenges. Both conditions share overlapping features, including fever, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction, making timely and accurate differentiation essential. CRS is driven by excessive cytokine release, predominantly IL-6, and is treated with IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab) and corticosteroids. Sepsis, by contrast, results from a dysregulated immune response to infection and requires antibiotics, as well as supportive care. Due to diagnostic uncertainty, clinicians often treat both conditions empirically. This can lead to inappropriate therapies-immunosuppressives may worsen sepsis, while antibiotics in CRS contribute to antimicrobial resistance and unnecessary healthcare burden. Existing biomarkers, such as IFN-gamma and IL-1beta, have shown potential but are limited by cost, availability, and the lack of rapid bedside implementation. There is a pressing need for a clinically accessible and reliable biomarker to distinguish CRS from sepsis in CAR-T patients. We hypothesise that the IL-6/procalcitonin (PCT) ratio will improve diagnostic accuracy. IL-6 is elevated in both conditions, while PCT is more specific to bacterial infection. However, PCT alone may be unreliable in immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving CAR-T therapy. The IL-6/PCT ratio is expected to reduce inter-individual variability and address limitations inherent to each marker when used alone. In this multi-centre, observational, prospective study, we will evaluate the IL-6/PCT ratio in febrile CAR-T patients. The primary analysis will focus on relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, with a prespecified expansion/validation across other CAR-T indications. Clinical adjudication will serve as the standard of reference. We will assess diagnostic performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cutoffs. This study, titled DRACARYS (Differentiating Reactions-CRS versus sepsis-After CAR-Ts), aims to enhance diagnostic precision, guide timely and appropriate treatment, and reduce complications and unnecessary healthcare utilisation in CAR-T recipients."
41346878,Pancreatico-Colonic Fistula: A Case Report on Diagnosis and Management.,2025,"Pancreatico-enteric fistulas are rare complications of chronic pancreatitis, with colonic involvement carrying particularly high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and prompt surgical management are critical to improving outcomes. We present a case of a patient with necrotizing pancreatitis who developed a pancreatico-colonic fistula five months following initial hospitalization. A male in his 40s with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis (status post-cholecystectomy) was transferred to our tertiary care hospital in septic shock. Imaging revealed necrotizing pancreatitis with a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, which was successfully embolized. CT-guided drainage of peripancreatic collections grew Escherichia (E.) coli (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or ESBL), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Streptococcus viridans, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient improved and was discharged after one month, but was lost to follow-up. Five months later, he was readmitted with persistent Streptococcus bacteremia. CT abdomen/pelvis with rectal contrast confirmed a pancreatico-colonic fistula at the splenic flexure. He underwent a robotic-assisted left colectomy with takedown of the fistula and end colostomy. Postoperatively, he recovered well, tolerated diet advancement, and was discharged on postoperative day seven. Pancreatico-colonic fistulas often result from spontaneous decompression of a pancreatic pseudocyst or abscess into adjacent bowel loops. Unlike other pancreatico-enteric fistulas, colonic involvement carries a significant risk due to the translocation of colonic flora and potential for sepsis. While small fistulas may respond to endoscopic closure, surgical resection remains the standard of care in patients with sepsis, large defects, or multiple perforations. Although uncommon, pancreatico-colonic fistula should be considered in patients with recurrent sepsis or bacteremia and a history of severe or necrotizing pancreatitis. Early imaging, surgical consultation, and definitive operative management are essential to improve outcomes."
41346599,Neutrophil dysregulation differentiates pediatric septic shock biomarker-based mortality-risk strata: insights from weighted gene co-expression network and transcriptomic analyses.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality, particularly among children, with limited therapeutic options beyond antibiotics and organ support. The Pediatric Sepsis Biomarker Risk Model (PERSEVERE-II) stratifies mortality risk in pediatric septic shock, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying high mortality risk remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We analyzed whole blood transcriptomes collected from 81 children with septic shock on day 1 of meeting study criteria. Patients were stratified into high- and low-mortality risk groups according to the PERSEVERE-II biomarker risk model. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analyses, we identified molecular pathways and transcription factors (TFs) associated with mortality risk. Cell type differences were inferred using CIBERSORTx and using a reference single-cell dataset inclusive of neutrophils and their subsets. FINDINGS: We identified distinct molecular profiles with high-risk patients displaying significant overexpression of genes related to neutrophil degranulation and innate immunity, alongside suppressed adaptive immune responses. The predominance of developing neutrophils underscored a major role of emergency granulopoiesis. Key TFs identified, including LTF, FOXM1, KLF1, and CEBPB, were linked to high-risk gene expression signatures. Our findings indicate a pathological shift toward a dysregulated neutrophil-driven hyperinflammation and adaptive immune suppressive state, which together are associated with adverse outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that neutrophil dysregulation underpins the high mortality risk conferred by the PERSEVERE-II model. The identified transcriptional regulators may provide potential targets to mitigate neutrophil dysregulation and improve outcomes among high-risk patients."
41346598,Plasma lipidomic signatures reveal age-associated patterns of septic shock risk and immune dysregulation in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with significant lipidomic disturbances, but age-associated lipidomic patterns remain poorly characterized. Given the links between aging, immune dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation, defining age-specific lipid profiles could improve sepsis risk assessment. This study investigates age-stratified lipidomic signatures in sepsis and identifies biomarkers for clinical severity. ​METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 62 sepsis patients (21 <65 years, 41 >/=65 years) and 40 healthy controls. Plasma lipidomics was performed via untargeted LC-MS/MS, identifying 1,277 lipid species across 38 subclasses. Principal component analysis (PCA) and consensus clustering were used to assess lipidomic differences and define patient subtypes. Correlations between lipid subclasses, clinical severity (SOFA scores), and immune cell subsets were analyzed. An age-adjusted risk stratification model was developed to assess septic shock and mortality risk (AUC analysis). ​RESULTS: Sepsis patients exhibited reduced phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl ester (CE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels (all P<0.05). Clustering revealed four lipidomic patterns, with Cluster 4 distinguishing two sepsis subtypes (C1, C2). Subtype C2 had higher septic shock incidence (57.1% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.0013) and downregulation of 92 lipids, 35 of which strongly correlated with SOFA scores. A risk stratification model incorporating six key lipids (LPC(19:0), PC(P-19:0), SM 32:3;2O(FA 16:3), PC(P-20:0), PC(O-18:1/20:3), CE(15:0)) and age accurately predicted septic shock (AUC: 0.87 training, 0.82 validation) and mortality risk in elderly patients. PC levels correlated with monocytes, while CE and LPC associated with complement proteins and CD8+ T cells. ​CONCLUSIONS: Our lipid-based model effectively predicts septic shock and mortality, particularly in elderly sepsis patients. Age-associated lipid alterations (PC, LPC, CE reduction) correlate with disease severity and immune dysregulation, suggesting distinct lipid-immune mechanisms in younger vs. elderly patients. These findings support lipidomics as a tool for sepsis risk stratification and personalized therapy."
41346365,Unveiling low level viremia in chronic hepatitis B: challenges and new horizons.,2025,"Low-level viremia (LLV) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) represents a significant challenge and area of interest in current clinical management. While nucleos (t)ide analogs (NAs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in suppressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, the application of highly sensitive detection methods has revealed that some treated patients continue to exhibit persistent or intermittent low-level viremia (HBV DNA: 12-2000 IU/mL). The mechanisms underlying LLV involve a synergistic interplay between host immune response deficiencies and HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) persistence. Furthermore, the complex regulation of LLV is influenced by metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Limitations in the clearance of cccDNA by current antiviral regimens also contribute to this phenomenon. LLV may elevate the risk of liver fibrosis progression, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and end-stage liver disease. Current management strategies emphasize optimizing antiviral regimens, such as switching to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) or combining therapies with pegylated interferon-alpha (Peg-IFN-alpha). Enhanced dynamic monitoring, including high-sensitivity HBV DNA assays and quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) measurements, is also crucial. Moreover, exploring combination therapies involving immunomodulation and hepatocyte regeneration is warranted. Further research should integrate multi-omics technologies with prospective cohort studies to elucidate the host-virus interaction network in LLV. This will allow for the validation of synergistic effects between metabolic interventionsand immunotherapy, thereby advancing personalized precision medicine. This review systematically synthesizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, influencing factors, prognosis, and clinical management advancements of LLV, aiming to provide novel perspectives for optimizing therapeutic strategies and translational research."
41345921,Development of a predictive model for septic shock-associated acute skin failure using readily available clinical variables.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute skin failure (ASF) is an understudied complication in patients with septic shock, and existing predictive models lack disease-specific variables. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations in patients with septic shock and to identify potential biomarkers and predictive factors for cutaneous deterioration. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed 154 adult patients with septic shock, defined according to the Sepsis 3.0 criteria, who were admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) between September 2020 and September 2022. Based on cutaneous manifestations observed during hospitalisation, the patients were stratified into two groups: the ASF group and the non-ASF group. Clinical characteristics, therapeutic interventions and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Significant univariate predictors were included in multivariable logistic regression. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 154 patients with septic shock, among whom 49 developed ASF, yielding an incidence rate of 31.8%. In the multivariate analysis, four independent predictors were identified: maximum norepinephrine (NE) dose (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, p = 0.051), NE duration (OR = 1.19, p = 0.054), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) (OR = 0.97, p = 0.042) and absence of oedema (OR = 0.18, p = 0.008). The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.730-0.876) with 72.3% sensitivity and 72.4% specificity at the optimal cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: The validated prediction model identifies patients with septic shock who are at high risk for ASF using four readily available clinical parameters: maximum NE dose, NE duration, ScvO(2) and absence of oedema, helping clinicians provide early warning and thereby reduce associated skin complications. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41345815,Molecular and phylogenetic characterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from primary pyoderma in a goat from tropical India: an emerging zoonotic threat.,2025,"Staphylococcus aureus is a globally prevalent zoonotic pathogen frequently associated with pyoderma in humans; however, molecular data on primary staphylococcal pyoderma in Indian goats are meagre. This report presents the first molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of S. aureus from a goat with primary pyoderma, along with clinical management. A four-month-old Malabari crossbred goat kid was presented to the Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Mannuthy, with pustules and scab-like lesions on perianal and abdominal skin. Dermatological evaluation indicated primary pyoderma, and impression smears revealed Gram-positive cocci and neutrophils. The isolate was catalase positive and exhibited sensitivity to tetracycline, gentamicin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone-tazobactam, and streptomycin, but showed resistance to multiple antibiotics. The isolate was identified as S. aureus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. BLAST analysis revealed 99.48% sequence identity with S. aureus strains isolated from human cases of sepsis and pyoderma in Uzbekistan, India, and the USA, as well as with a complete genome sequence of a human blood isolate from Brazil. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated clustering with human isolates reported from multiple continents. A combination therapy of ceftriaxone-tazobactam and gentamicin for seven days based on culture and sensitivity test led to complete recovery. The genetic proximity to human pathogenic strains across diverse regions highlighted the broad host range of the bacterium. The findings of present study underscore the need for molecular surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, and integrated One Health strategies to mitigate emerging zoonotic threats, particularly in regions with frequent human-livestock contact."
41345740,Newborns with ARDS originating from sepsis of extrapulmonary origin exhibit worse prognoses: findings from a multicenter study in China.,2025,"Research on the infection-related etiologies of neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (NARDS) remains limited. This study aimed to investigate mortality risk differences in NARDS attributed to distinct infection origins (sepsis of extrapulmonary origin or pulmonary infection origin). Subjects were derived from a multicenter retrospective study organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Neonatal Respiratory Failure Collaboration Network. It included neonates with NARDS who initiated invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 72 h of birth. A total of 268 from 1275 NARDS cases with infectious etiologies were enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression found a significant difference in the survival prognosis (sepsis of extrapulmonary origin, adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 3.93, 95% CI 1.79-8.62, log-rank test: P < 0.001]. Further multi-model and sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness. Between early-onset and late-onset NARDS, the subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in the mortality risk, whether it was pulmonary infection origin (HR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61-4.64) or sepsis of extrapulmonary origin (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.17-1.51). Restricted cubic spline also exhibited that the onset time of NARDS was not related to the mortality risk. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that for sepsis of extrapulmonary origin, we should be more vigilant about the mortality risk it brings and deal with the risk factors more actively and prudently. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Limited research has systematically investigated the association between infection origin and mortality risk in neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (NARDS). WHAT IS NEW: * Our study found that sepsis of extrapulmonary origin was associated with an increased mortality risk in neonates with gestational age > 34 weeks, with robust results from multivariate Cox modeling and sensitivity analyses. * It highlights the need for heightened vigilance and proactive management of extrapulmonary sepsis-related NARDS to mitigate mortality risk in neonates."
41345346,"Risk of intestinal complications, extraintestinal morbidity, and mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis and ocular involvement.",2026,"PURPOSE: To explore health outcomes of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and associated ocular inflammatory disease, compared to those of matched patients with UC without associated ocular inflammatory disease. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. METHODS: An aggregated electronic health records research network, TriNetX (Cambridge, MA, USA), was used to identify patients diagnosed with UC stratified by the presence or absence of ocular inflammatory disease with at least one year of follow-up. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for baseline demographics and medical comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates and relative risk (RR) of developing various forms of intestinal complications, extraintestinal morbidities, rheumatologic disease, cardiovascular disease, and death. RESULTS: Patients with UC with associated ocular inflammatory disease showed greater risk of undergoing total colectomy, as well as acquiring Clostridioides difficile and CMV colitis. They also demonstrated a greater risk of developing MASLD, vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, UC-related dermatological disease, osteoporosis, and sepsis. These individuals were more likely to carry rheumatologic diagnoses, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic, rheumatoid, enteropathic, reactive, and inflammatory arthritis. There was an elevated risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and VTE in this cohort as well. There was no significant difference in risks of colorectal cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, toxic megacolon, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, or mortality between the cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC with ocular inflammatory disease have an increased risk of intestinal complications, extraintestinal morbidity, rheumatologic disease, and cardiovascular complications when compared to those without."
41345081,"Cytochrome c oxidase dependent respiration is essential for T cell activation, proliferation and memory formation.",2025,"T cell activation requires extensive metabolic reprogramming, but the specific requirement for mitochondrial respiration (MR) remains unresolved. While most studies have focused on aerobic glycolysis as the primary driver of proliferation and effector function, the role of MR has not been completely defined. To isolate MR from proton pumping by cytochrome c oxidase (COX), we expressed the non-proton-pumping alternative oxidase (AOX) in activated COX-deficient T cells. AOX restored electron flow, membrane potential, and mitochondrial ATP production, ultimately rescuing proliferation, effector and memory differentiation, and antiviral immunity. These improvements required upstream electron input, particularly from Complex I, with Complex II and DHODH contributing more modestly. Despite restored MR, glycolysis remained elevated, likely due to altered redox signaling. These findings demonstrate that MR, normally mediated by COX, is necessary and can be sufficient to support T cell activation and function, independent of proton translocation, provided upstream electron input is maintained."
41344576,Protein post-translational modifications in sepsis: Molecular mechanisms and biomarkers.,2026,"Sepsis is a common and highly fatal condition in intensive care units and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. As a clinically complex syndrome with intricate pathophysiology, early identification and assessment of sepsis remain challenging. Deeper insights at the molecular level are crucial for understanding the complex pathophysiological mechanisms, discovering new biomarkers, and improving prognosis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) refer to the attachment of specific chemical groups to amino acid side chains through covalent, enzymatic, or non-enzymatic means, greatly expanding protein diversity and playing critical roles in many cellular signaling pathways. Here, we elucidate the regulatory roles of PTMs in sepsis pathways and key proteins, including immune response, late-stage inflammatory mediators, cellular metabolic reprogramming, and endothelial injury. We also summarize the progress in research on PTM-related sepsis biomarkers, covering diagnosis, prognosis, and organ dysfunction assessment, with a particular focus on the potential of glycosylation as a biomarker. Furthermore, we review current methodologies for studying PTMs. Continued focus on PTMs will pave the way for new possibilities in sepsis research and treatment."
41344335,Comparative effectiveness of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors versus erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on prognosis in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease: a propensity-matched cohort study.,2025,"Renal anemia in patients with stage-IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which are effective but associated with cardiovascular risks, variable responsiveness, and inflammatory complications. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) have recently emerged as an alternative therapy that enhances endogenous erythropoietin production and improves iron metabolism. This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network to compare clinical outcomes between HIF-PHI and ESA users in non-dialysis stage IV CKD patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). After 1:1 propensity score matching, 493 patients were included in each group and followed for up to three years. HIF-PHI therapy was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.58; p < 0.0001) and reduced sepsis risk (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.14-0.74; p = 0.01) compared with ESA therapy. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent mortality benefit across major comorbidities, with the greatest advantage observed in patients with ferritin 100-299 ng/mL (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.23-0.74; p = 0.002) and in comparisons against short-acting ESAs (HR 0.55; p = 0.0304). No survival difference was observed between HIF-PHI and long-acting ESA users, indicating that the observed benefit of HIF-PHIs was driven exclusively by differences versus short-acting ESAs. These findings suggest that HIF-PHIs may offer a safer and more physiologically adaptive approach to correcting anemia in advanced CKD, particularly when compared with short-acting ESA therapy. In contrast, long-acting ESAs achieve outcomes comparable to those of HIF-PHIs."
41344135,TREM-1: A potential prognostic marker in newborns with late-onset sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS) continues to be a complex task, highlighting the need for continued research to discover reliable biomarkers that can improve both diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation. This experimental prospective cohort study aimed to assess the potential of TREM-1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for LOS. METHODS: This study included 121 newborns (NBs) distributed as follows: 84 blood samples from NBs with LOS, categorized into Gram-negative sepsis, Gram-positive sepsis, and culture-negative sepsis groups, along with 37 infection-free controls. sTREM-1 levels were measured using an immunoenzymatic assay on samples collected at diagnosis and on days 3 and 7 afterward, while TREM1 gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR on the day of diagnosis. RESULTS: Despite not being a significant diagnostic tool, the univariate logistic regression indicated that high sTREM-1 levels were strongly associated with septic shock, in addition to thermal instability and male sex. The adjusted multivariate analysis confirmed that elevated sTREM-1 levels (OR = 3.85, p = 0.032), and male sex (OR = 5.67, p = 0.016) were significantly associated with septic shock. Gene expression analysis revealed reduced TREM1 gene expression in infected neonates relative to controls; however, patients who died showed significantly higher expression levels (p < 0.001), indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: sTREM-1 showed good accuracy as a predictor of severity in LOS. TREM1 high expression was associated with a worse prognosis in septic neonates. However, additional studies involving a larger number of individuals are necessary to validate the clinical utility of this biomarker in practice."
41344066,Thoracic radiotherapy plus maintenance durvalumab after first line carboplatin and etoposide plus durvalumab in extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) - A multicenter single arm open label phase II trial (SAKK 15/19).,2026,"BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumour type accounting for 10-15 % of lung cancers. The role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in extensive stage SCLC (ES_SCLC) in the era of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) is undefined. METHODS: SAKK 15-19 is a national, multicenter, single-arm prospective phase II study evaluating consolidative TRT after standard first-line chemotherapy plus durvalumab in ES-SCLC. Patients (pts) with confirmed ES-SCLC and ECOG </= 1 received carboplatin AUC5 (day 1), etoposide 100 mg/m(2) (days 1-3) and durvalumab 1500 mg (day 1) for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance durvalumab every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in pts without progression. TRT (39 Gy in 13 fractions over 2.5 weeks) was delivered within 5 weeks after chemoimmunotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was permitted. The primary endpoint was 12-month progression-free rate (PFR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate and overall survival (OS). The study aimed at a 12-month PFR >/= 25 % (H1) vs. </= 12.5 %. RESULTS: Forty-six pts were enrolled; 37 % had ECOG 0, 30 % had asymptomatic brain metastases. At 29-month follow-up, the 12-month PFR was 15.6 (95 % CI 7-27.5), median PFS 6.4 months (95 % CI 4.8-7.2) and median OS 15.0 months (95 % CI 10.2-22.0). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 23.9 % of pts, mainly neutropenia (23.9 %) and thrombocytopenia (8.4 %). One pt (2 %) had grade 5 sepsis; no severe TRT-related toxicities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Adding consolidative TRT after chemotherapy plus durvalumab in ES-SCLC didn't meet the primary endpoint of the expected 12-month PFR. No additional severe toxicities from TRT were observed. Ongoing larger Phase III trials, including RAPTOR (LNRG LU007), will further define TRT's role in this setting."
41343808,Online Clinical Calculator for Predicting 28-Day Mortality in Older Adult Patients With Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy: Retrospective Study Using MIMIC-IV.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) represents a critical complication of sepsis, especially among older adults. Despite its clinical relevance, there remains a lack of accessible and practical tools specifically designed to predict 28-day mortality in this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to enhance the practical applicability of the model by creating a web-based tool that allows real-time, individualized mortality risk prediction, facilitating early intervention and informed decision-making in clinical practice. METHODS: Using data extracted from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database, we identified older patients (>/=65 years) with SAE (n=2165) and divided them into a development cohort (n=1531) and a validation cohort (n=634). Key risk factors associated with 28-day mortality were identified, and a predictive nomogram was constructed. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index, integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification index, and calibration curve analysis. Clinical applicability was assessed through decision curve analysis and benchmarked against traditional intensive care unit (ICU) scoring systems. Furthermore, the nomogram was deployed as a web-based application, enabling clinicians to input data and generate individualized mortality predictions. RESULTS: A total of 2165 older patients with SAE were included, among whom 290 (13.4%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression identified lower body weight (odds ratio [OR] 0.985, 95% CI 0.975-0.994; P=.001), lower systolic blood pressure (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.957-0.986; P<.001), lower hemoglobin (OR 0.984, 95% CI 0.974-0.995; P=.005), lower PaO2 (OR 0.996, 95% CI 0.994-0.997; P<.001), and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR 0.825, 95% CI 0.786-0.864; P<.001) as mortality risk factors. Higher respiratory rate (OR 1.083, 95% CI 1.029-1.141; P=.002), increased anion gap (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.031-1.135; P=.001), elevated blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.045, 95% CI 1.016-1.076; P=.002), prolonged partial thromboplastin time (OR 1.033, 95% CI 1.016-1.050; P<.001), and reduced urine output (OR>0.99, 95% CI 0.999-1.000; P=.002) were also predictive. Patients admitted to ""other"" ICU types had lower mortality compared with the medical ICU reference group (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.176-0.609; P<.001). The nomogram achieved concordance index values of 0.899 (development) and 0.897 (validation), outperforming sequential organ failure assessment (0.692), Acute Physiology Score III (0.804), Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (0.771), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (0.704), and Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (0.753), with significant integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification index improvements (all P<.001). Calibration curves confirmed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, while decision curve analysis supported the model's superior clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a novel, validated nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality in older patients with SAE, integrating routinely available clinical data. The deployment of the model as a digital tool enhances its accessibility and usability, providing clinicians with a practical resource for risk stratification and individualized patient management."
41343415,Prognostic value of laboratory markers and clinical scores for mortality in intensive care unit patients with sepsis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, especially for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), where early identification of the prognosis is critical. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of inflammatory markers, clinical scores, and specific laboratory findings for predicting ICU and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the ICU of a university hospital between September 2019 and December 2022. To minimize selection bias, all eligible patients during the study period were consecutively included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and included demographics, clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, and clinical scores such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). The primary outcomes were ICU and in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 213 ICU patients with sepsis were included in the study. The patients were 62.0% male with a mean age of 73.1 +/- 12.6 years. The ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 29.6% and 36.6%, respectively. Non-survivors had higher clinical severity scores and poorer nutritional and perfusion profiles than survivors. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated lactate levels (a marker of tissue hypoperfusion) and higher SAPS 3 scores were independently associated with ICU mortality. For in-hospital mortality, lower albumin levels and higher SAPS 3 scores were significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: High lactate and SAPS 3 scores were independent predictors of mortality, while higher albumin levels showed a potential protective effect. Early identification of these factors may aid in the management of sepsis."
41343270,Takotsubo syndrome after sigmoid perforation.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Takotsubo syndrome presents with the sudden onset of symptoms resembling with acute coronary syndrome with typical transient myocardial kinetic disorder. In the secondary form of the disease, the initial symptoms of the patient are extracardiac. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old female patient with a history of ischemic heart disease underwent urgent Hartmann's resection for sigmoid perforation due to Clostridium colitis. Two days after the primary surgery, during a planned surgical revision for another pathology, the patient developed cardiorespiratory failure. Due to the electrocardiographic finding of newly developed left bundle branch block and the echocardiographic image of extensive local kinetic disorder with severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, the patient was indicated for selective coronary angiography with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. The examination did not demonstrate coronary artery involvement. After the diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome was established, the patient was successfully treated with gradual resolution of symptoms and normalization of left ventricular function. CONCLUSION: Takotsubo syndrome is a diagnosis that can be potentially fatal and -should be a part of the differential diagnostic assessment in surgical patients when acute coronary syndrome is suspected. With properly adjusted therapy, the symptoms of this disease disappear without functional and morphological consequences."
41342605,Sepsis Bundle Adherence and Early Vasopressor Administration in Pediatric Septic Shock: Secondary Analysis of Outcomes in a 2023 Multicenter Cohort in Bolivia.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: In a cohort of children with septic shock, we evaluated the association between vasoactive agent use within 1 hour of starting our sepsis bundle and mortality. Secondarily, we assessed the relationship between sepsis bundle adherence and mortality and other outcomes. DESIGN: Nonpreplanned, secondary analysis of a national multicenter dataset collected in a resource-limited setting. SETTING: Dataset from 14 centers in Bolivia collected between January 2023 and December 2023. PATIENTS: Children under 15 years old with sepsis or septic shock defined using altitude-adjusted Phoenix criteria. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 268 patients in this secondary analysis, with median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 17 months (IQR, 6-63 mo). The sepsis bundle was used within 3 hours in 131 of 268 patients (49%). Vasopressors were used in 102 of 268 patients (38%) and 85 of 102 (83%) had received peripheral administration within the 1 hour of persistent hypotension, without any record of adverse events. Early vasopressor use within 1 hour of septic shock recognition, and antibiotic administration within 1 hour of sepsis recognition, were independently associated with lower odds (using adjusted odds ratio [aOR] and 95% CI) of mortality, respectively: 0.49 (95% CI, 0.28-0.89) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24-0.71; both p = 0.001). Failure to complete the sepsis bundle within 3 hours was associated with greater odds of mortality (aOR, 3.61 [95% CI, 1.64-7.91]; p = 0.001) and greater odds of longer interval before emergency consultation (aOR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07]; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of vasoactive agents in children with septic shock and timely sepsis bundle completion were independently associated with lower hazard of mortality. Historically, in Bolivia in 2023, bundle adherence was suboptimal, yet feasible interventions were associated with greater odds of better outcomes in pediatric sepsis and septic shock."
41342292,Clinical Outcomes of Low-Grade Cytomegalovirus DNAemia in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients Receiving Letermovir Prophylaxis.,2025,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a major contributor to CMV-related and hematologic adverse outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. While letermovir has improved CMV prophylaxis strategies in this population, the clinical implications of low-grade CMV DNAemia during letermovir prophylaxis remain uncertain. We retrospectively analyzed 255 HSCT recipients who received letermovir at a tertiary hospital in Korea. Patients were stratified into three groups based on the highest CMV DNAemia levels observed during letermovir prophylaxis: no DNAemia (n = 72), low-grade DNAemia (< 1000 IU/mL; n = 171), and high-grade DNAemia (>/= 1000 IU/mL; n = 12). The association between low-grade CMV DNAemia and clinical outcomes was assessed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Most low-grade DNAemia cases were transient and resolved without antiviral therapy. Compared to no DNAemia, low-grade CMV DNAemia was not associated with an increased risk of clinically significant CMV infection by Day 100 (p = 0.262) or Day 365 (p = 0.399). No significant associations were observed with engraftment failure (p = 0.098), disease relapse (p = 0.165), or all-cause mortality (p = 0.537). Our findings suggest that close monitoring may be sufficient for low-grade DNAemia under letermovir prophylaxis."
41341432,Normative Laboratory Value Ranges in Pediatric Patients Who Underwent Evaluation for MIS-C.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is challenging due to symptom overlap with other common conditions. The primary objective of this multicenter study was to establish normative laboratory values in MIS-C patients and compare to patients evaluated for MIS-C who had other final diagnoses. METHODS: Five hospitals reviewed records of a cohort of patients 6 months to 18 years old who were evaluated for MIS-C between March 31(st) 2020 and February 1(st) 2022. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, and laboratory values were compared in patients with a final diagnosis of MIS-C versus all other conditions. Patients' final diagnoses and laboratory values for each diagnosis were reported. RESULTS: Of the 1319 patients that were evaluated for MIS-C at presentation, 293 (22.2%) received a final diagnosis of MIS-C. MIS-C patients had statistically significant differences in laboratory values including D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, troponin, and brain natriuretic peptide when compared to patients evaluated for MIS-C but subsequently diagnosed with other conditions. The most common non-MIS-C diagnoses within this cohort were viral illnesses (26.7%), acute COVID-19 (12.0%), pyelonephritis (6.4%), fever of unknown origin (4.9%), pneumonia (4.7%), gastroenteritis (4.7%), Kawasaki disease (3.7%), other bacterial infections, (3.1%), rheumatologic conditions (3.1%), and sepsis (2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients who underwent laboratory evaluation for MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic received a final diagnosis other than MIS-C. These data may aid pediatricians in differentiating between MIS-C and other febrile conditions as well as reduce unnecessary testing."
41341321,Correlation Between Anteroposterior/Transverse Ratio of Inferior Vena Cava Diameter on Computed Tomography and Prognosis in Patients With Sepsis: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"Background Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, and accurate early prognostication remains difficult. The anteroposterior-to-transverse (AP/T) diameter ratio of the inferior vena cava (IVC), measured on computed tomography (CT), offers a simple, objective indicator of intravascular volume status and may correlate with outcomes. Objectives To assess whether a lower CT-derived IVC AP/T diameter ratio - used as a surrogate for intravascular volume status - is associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality in adult sepsis patients and to evaluate whether stratification using an optimal cutoff can differentiate mortality risk. Methods In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we included adult patients diagnosed with sepsis from April 1, 2020 to April 1, 2023. The IVC AP/T ratio was measured on CT scans just below the renal veins. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified the optimal cutoff, and patients were stratified accordingly to compare mortality. Results Of 435 patients, 396 had evaluable CT data. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 20.6%. Non-survivors had a significantly lower median IVC AP/T ratio than survivors (0.401 vs. 0.525, p<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression incorporating age, serum lactate, components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the IVC AP/T ratio, the AP/T ratio was not identified as an independent predictor of mortality. The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, identifying 0.44 as the optimal cutoff. At this threshold, the accuracy was 63.5%, sensitivity 61.7%, and specificity 68.6%. Patients with an AP/T ratio </=0.44 were found to have significantly higher mortality than those with a ratio >0.44 (33.6% vs. 12.6%, p<0.001). Conclusions The IVC AP/T ratio assessed via CT was significantly associated with 30-day mortality in univariate analysis and may help stratify sepsis patients into different risk categories. However, it was not identified as an independent predictor in multivariable analysis, and its discriminatory ability was modest (AUC 0.64). These findings suggest that while the metric is not sufficient as a standalone predictor, it may serve as a supplementary risk indicator. Further prospective, multicenter studies are warranted to validate its clinical utility and integration into existing prognostic models."
41341291,Characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome concomitant sepsis: a retrospective multicenter cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to examine the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) concomitant sepsis, and to develop and verify a nomogram model for predicting mortality risk. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective analysis examined clinical data from patients with ACS concomitant sepsis who were hospitalized in the intensive care units of tertiary hospitals in Southern China between January 2013 and December 2023. In-hospital mortality functioned as the principal outcome. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, together with LASSO regression, were used to ascertain independent risk factors for the outcome. The evaluation of model performance was conducted by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), and calibration plots. RESULTS: This study comprised a total of 200 patients. During hospitalization, 122 people (61.0%) succumbed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at admission (OR = 2.081, 95% CI: 1.120-3.866, P = 0.0206), an elevated initial neutrophil count (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.000-1.102, P = 0.0495), and a history of coronary artery disease (OR = 2.953, 95% CI: 1.173-7.436, P = 0.0215) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The nomogram model that includes these parameters exhibited an AUC of 0.641 (95% CI: 0.564-0.718), with a sensitivity of 0.656 and a specificity of 0.603. Calibration curves demonstrated strong concordance between expected and observed results (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with ACS concomitant sepsis experience heightened in-hospital mortality, which is substantially correlated with a diagnosis of STEMI at admission, increased initial neutrophil count, and pre-existing coronary artery disease. While the discriminative capacity (AUC = 0.641) of this three-factor nomogram necessitates additional enhancement, its commendable calibration provides a first instrument for early risk categorization, illustrating practical applicability for swift evaluation. Extensive investigations are necessary to improve model efficacy."
41341126,Comparison of the predictive value of different non-insulin-based insulin resistance indices for acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), but the preferred surrogate markers of IR have not been validated in patients with sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of triglyceride glucose index (TyG), metabolic score for IR (METS-IR) and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) for the development of AKI in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The cohort was divided into based on the tertiles of the surrogate indices of IR and Kaplan-Meier curve was depicted the outcomes of each group. Correlations of these three surrogate markers of IR with sepsis-associated AKI and stage III AKI were evaluated through Cox regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS). RESULTS: Of the 997 septic patients enrolled in this study, 748 patients (75.03%) developed AKI and 286 (28.69%) eventually progressed to stage III AKI. Cox regression models and RCS showed that only METS-IR was significantly correlated with the development of AKI and stage III AKI in patients with sepsis in a non-linear positive manner. Subgroup analysis showed that the correlation between METS-IR and AKI was not remarkable in patients with heart failure (P = 0.925), chronic kidney disease (P = 0.284), and diabetes (P = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: The current study compared the three accepted surrogate indices of IR and the results suggested that METS-IR may prove to be an ideal risk stratification tool for sepsis-associated AKI, showing a non-linear positive correlation."
41341033,Predicting tigecycline-related adverse events in infected patients: a machine learning approach with clinical interpretability.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Tigecycline (TGC), while effective against multidrug-resistant infections, is limited by hepatotoxicity and coagulation disorders, yet lacks robust predictive tools. METHODS: We developed an online dynamic nomogram to assess these adverse events using retrospective data from 2,553 TGC-treated patients (2020-2025). Seventy-seven clinical features were analyzed using Boruta and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for feature selection. Seven machine learning (ML) models were evaluated via ten-fold cross-validation, as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curves, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis for interpretability and an online dynamic nomogram for clinical translation. RESULTS: Logistic regression (LR) outperformed other algorithms, achieving Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.727-0.874) for hepatotoxicity and 0.755 (95% CI: 0.665-0.845) for coagulation dysfunction. Independent risk factors for liver injury included prolonged treatment duration, high dosage, ICU admission, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and elevated baseline levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Risk factors for coagulation dysfunction included extended treatment duration, ICU admission, elevated baseline creatinine (Cr), sepsis, and septic shock. Notably, co-administration of meloxicillin and higher baseline red blood cell (RBC) levels appeared to be protective. CONCLUSION: This study constructed an online dynamic nomogram with good discrimination and calibration, which can help to identify high-risk patients and assist clinicians in early risk stratification and individualized treatment planning."
41340983,Diagnosis and management strategies for an elderly patient with Neisseria meningitidis sepsis complicated by multiple organ dysfunction: A case report.,2025,"An 88-year-old male presented with sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) infection, a severe and often atypical presentation in the elderly. His condition, characterized by subtle symptoms, rapidly improved with early broad-spectrum antibiotics, susceptibility-guided therapy, and multidisciplinary care. The patient fully recovered and was discharged on day 8, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and aggressive support in this vulnerable population."
41340251,A 27-Year-Old Man with Chronic Traumatic Pancreatic Fistula Managed with Percutaneous Microwave Ablation.,2025,"BACKGROUND Pancreatic fistulas are serious complications following abdominal trauma which are often overlooked and may lead to hemorrhage, sepsis, and abscess formation. Early diagnosis is critical, yet options are limited when the anatomy gets distorted secondary to a high impact collision. In the setting of trauma, delayed or missed ductal injuries can perpetuate collections and septic physiology despite drainage. Although commonly treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or conservative measures, a complex case of pancreatic fistula seen in our clinic saw mainstream treatments continuously fail. This report describes the case of a 27-year-old man with chronic post-traumatic pancreatic fistula successfully managed with percutaneous microwave ablation. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old man sustained blunt abdominal trauma in a road traffic collision and developed a chronic pancreatic fistula. Despite multiple surgeries, conservative management with octreotide, total parenteral nutrition, and several unsuccessful attempts at ERCP, the fistula persisted, leading to recurrent sepsis and multi-organ failure. As a last resort, computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of the pancreatic neck was performed. Multidisciplinary consensus favored targeted thermal occlusion to achieve source control while avoiding another high-risk laparotomy. The procedure resolved the fistula within 4 weeks. Drain output fell and the patient stabilized without further organ support. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates a novel use of percutaneous microwave ablation to treat a chronic traumatic pancreatic fistula, highlighting microwave ablation as a potential therapeutic option when conventional treatments fail. Also highlighted is the importance of early consideration of pancreatic fistula in cases of abdominal trauma."
41340077,Cx43 hemichannel-mediated paracrine involves in the promotion of MSCs on skin wound healing.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit therapeutic potential in wound healing, primarily through their paracrine effects. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects remain ambiguous. Connexin 43 (Cx43), the most abundantly expressed connexins in MSCs, forms hemichannels that mediate the paracrine release of small molecules, suggesting a potential role in MSC-mediated wound healing. METHODS: A full-thickness skin wound model was established in mice to investigate the role of Cx43 hemichannels in MSC-mediated wound healing. Wounds were treated with MSC-conditioned medium (MSC CM), Cx43 hemichannel-inhibited medium (18alpha-GA CM), or control medium (CTRL CM, complete medium). The assessment of wound healing was conducted through histological and immunofluorescence analyses. Besides, macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts treated with the three media were subjected to in vitro investigations. The underlying mechanisms were investigated using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: MSC CM promoted wound healing partly through Cx43-dependent mechanisms. Cx43 hemichannel-dependent ATP release activated purinergic receptors and the AKT signaling pathway to facilitate macrophage polarization during the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels prevented MSC CM-induced angiogenesis activation and fibroblast migration during the proliferation phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel mechanism that MSCs promote wound healing through Cx43 hemichannel-mediated paracrine, mainly ATP secretion. MSC CM facilitates macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, and fibroblast migration, ultimately enhancing tissue repair. Our finding identifies a novel role for Cx43 hemichannels in the process that MSCs facilitate tissue repair and offer a promising therapeutic strategy in clinical applications to improve wound healing."
41339821,Diagnostic performance of procalcitonin and presepsin in sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical emergency condition characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated response to infection. In the fast-paced emergency department (ED) setting, rapid identification and prompt initiation of treatment within the initial hours following sepsis onset are critical for reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. However, a timely and accurate diagnosis remains a significant challenge in emergency medicine. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin (P-SEP) have been proposed as tools to distinguish sepsis from other non-infectious inflammatory conditions frequently encountered in the ED, though their diagnostic effectiveness remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PCT and P-SEP for diagnosis patients with sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Scopus databases up to April 1st, 2024 and updated on June 30th, 2025. Studies reporting sensitivity and specificity of PCT and P-SEP for sepsis detection among patients in acute and emergency settings were included. Hierarchical modeling techniques were utilized to pool data for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirty-eight observational studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivities and specificities for detecting sepsis using PCT were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82), respectively. Similarly, for P-SEP, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.83), respectively. No statistically significant differences were identified between PCT and P-SEP regarding sensitivity (p = 0.169) or specificity (p = 0.792). The summary receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87) for PCT and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90) for P-SEP. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCT and P-SEP represent reliable biomarkers for early and accurate sepsis detection in acute and ED settings, demonstrating comparable diagnostic performance. Their integration into routine ED assessment protocols may support timely clinical decision-making and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies."
41339723,Biomarker studies to predict outcomes of patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome measured pre and post initiation of veno venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2025,"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) is a resource intensive and expensive therapy increasingly used to treat a select group of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). High levels of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) are reported to be predictive of mortality in non-COVID ARDS patients receiving ECMO. In this study we evaluated if levels of biomarkers including IL-10 can predict mortality if measured prior to ECMO initiation in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. A total of sixteen patients with COVID-related ARDS undergoing treatment with ECMO were included in the pre-ECMO biomarker analysis, while samples from a total of 22 patients with post-ECMO samples were analyzed. Nine of sixteen patients with pre-ECMO samples (56%) survived to hospital discharge. There was no difference in baseline demographics between survivors and non-survivors. In univariate analysis, survivors had no difference in IL-10 levels prior to ECMO initiation although we identified several other biomarkers (Ang 1 and TNF-alpha with logistical regression, Mitochondrial DNA and IP-10 with Kaplan-Meier analysis) that differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Moreover, as opposed to a prior study, area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed that IL-10 levels were not predictive of survival. We advise caution for utilizing a single biomarker as outcome predictor in this highly complex population with often long clinical courses despite our promising results."
41339488,Reforming disease prognosis and treatment prediction for palliative care with hybrid metaheuristic deep neural architectures in IoT healthcare ecosystems.,2025,"The increasing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare has led to massive, high-dimensional data streams, demanding advanced, adaptive learning models for timely and accurate clinical predictions, especially in sensitive domains such as palliative care. Existing models often suffer from high computational overhead, sensitivity to learning rate variations, and difficulties in handling non-stationary data, which impedes their ability to deliver accurate and prompt predictions in high-risk medical scenarios. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Hybrid Metaheuristic-Driven Deep Neural Architectures (HMDNA) that combines a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) for sepsis detection and prognosis. The methodology follows a structured pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and optimization. Time-series ICU data were preprocessed using k-NN imputation and min-max scaling, followed by DNN training with CSO-based optimization applied at initialization, mid-training, and fine-tuning stages. Implemented using TensorFlow and trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, the model achieved an accuracy of 92.7%, precision of 91.8%, recall of 90.3%, and F1 score of 91.4%. These results significantly outperform baseline models including traditional DNN (85.3% accuracy), DNN + GA (88.5%), DNN + PSO (89.2%), and DNN + ACO (90.1%). The proposed model demonstrated faster convergence, better generalization, and robustness to real-time variability in healthcare data. By combining the strengths of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization, this approach ensures reliable performance in dynamic and unpredictable clinical environments. The study highlights the potential of adaptive, hybrid AI models in enhancing healthcare decision-making, particularly in critical care scenarios where prediction accuracy and model responsiveness are vital for improving patient outcomes."
41338962,Value of targeted testing for cytomegalovirus in preterm infants: 7 years' experience at a tertiary London hospital.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Targeted testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in preterm infants <21 days has two benefits: timely congenital CMV (cCMV) diagnosis, and differentiation between cCMV and postnatal CMV (pCMV). We present an audit of targeted testing for cCMV alongside rates of clinically suspected pCMV in preterm infants. METHODS: We collected data on CMV testing from 2016 to 2023 in infants born <30 weeks gestation during admission to a tertiary London neonatal centre. RESULTS: Of all infants, 77% (899/1162) were tested for CMV during their admission with 74.6% tested <21 days of age. CMV infection was confirmed in 58 infants, 4 cases of cCMV (0.4%) and 54 cases of pCMV (6.0%). One infant with cCMV died, and all were symptomatic: microcephaly, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, white matter hyperintensity on brain imaging, but none had hearing loss. Most pCMV cases (92.6%) were symptomatic, with bone-marrow suppression (92.6%), sepsis-like syndrome (50%), respiratory (31.5%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (29.6%). All infants with cCMV and 38.9% of infants with pCMV received treatment. Overall, 6% (54/899) had symptomatic CMV disease, 16.7% of infants with CMV died during their neonatal intensive care unit admission, and 42.6% were discharged on home oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: CMV causes a substantial disease burden in infants born <30 weeks gestation, whereby 6% have symptomatic CMV disease. We show the feasibility and value of targeted cCMV and opportunistic pCMV testing. In the absence of universal screening, targeted birth testing for cCMV in infants <30 weeks gestational age should be considered."
41338568,Surgical Treatment of Cardiac Tumors: A Single-Center Experience.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiac tumors affect fewer than 1 in 2000 people. This study is a retrospective review of diagnostic procedures, surgical management, and outcomes in patients treated for tumors of the heart at our institution. We compare our management approaches, clinical, and surgical outcomes with those reported in the literature. METHODS: The study population includes patients 7 to 79 years old who presented to our institution for tumors of the heart from July 2004 to January 2023. With institutional review board approval, subjects for this study were identified by searching the hospital's database on Current Procedural Terminology codes for tumors of the heart (benign neoplasm of the heart or malignant tumor). All of the data were stored on REDCap. RESULTS: There were 23 men and 29 women in the patient group. The average patient age was 54 years old. The most common presentation symptoms were dyspnea and fatigue. The most common diagnosis methods were transthoracic echocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance image, and computed tomography scan. Operative treatment was offered to 52 people; 47 had resection and 5 had biopsy only. The most common postoperative complication was respiratory insufficiency (22) and sepsis (2). Forty-eight patients were diagnosed as having a benign neoplasm of the heart and 4 diagnosed as having a malignant tumor. There were 49 primary tumors and three secondary tumors. The most common location of the tumor was the left atrium. The most common diagnosed cell type for the cardiac tumors was myxoma (61.5%). The average length of stay in the hospital was 12.5 days. Thirty-nine patients were discharged home in a stable condition. The study population had one operative mortality (death within 30 days after surgery). Forty-four of the 52 patients treated are alive after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study strongly suggest that surgical removal is a viable and largely successful treatment approach for cardiac tumors. Clinical outcomes such as discharge status, postoperative condition, and length of survival after procedures are similar to those from other referral centers for such conditions. Complete resection was possible in 90% of our study cases; 85% of patients in this study surgically treated for cardiac tumors are alive after 2 years."
41338526,High Torque teno virus viremia predicts long-term mortality and reflects chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) in geriatric inpatients.,2026,"Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus whose viremia increases in conditions of immune dysfunction and aging, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker of immunosenescence. This study investigated the association between TTV viremia and all-cause mortality risk over seven years in a hospitalized older cohort, and its relationship with inflammatory markers including osteopontin (OPN) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Data from 956 patients were analyzed, with high TTV load defined as >/=5 log DNA copies/mL. High TTV viremia was significantly associated with increased mortality risk at 1, 3, and 7 years independently of age, sex, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers. In stratified analyses, this association was significant at one year in both males and females, but persisted at three and seven years only in males. The strongest association was observed in participants aged 80-89 years, remaining significant across all follow-up periods. When patients were stratified by a composite immune score reflecting degrees of immunosenescence, high TTV viremia predicted increased mortality among those with intermediate or severe immune dysfunction, persisting up to seven years in the most immunosenescent subgroup. Patients with elevated TTV loads exhibited increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), decreased serum albumin and hemoglobin, and significantly higher plasma levels of OPN and GDF15, whereas IL-10 tended to decrease. No significant differences were observed for neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, IL-6, CD163, CCL22, or CXCL9 between high and low TTV viremia groups. These findings indicate that high TTV viremia independently predicts mortality risk and reflects a pro-inflammatory and immunosenescent state."
41337457,Analysis of the cardiovascular response to standardized polymicrobial peritonitis experimental model.,2025,"The aim of this work is to study the response of pigs to an inflammatory insult, consisting of intraperitoneal instillation of autologous feces, by monitoring them from the induction of sepsis to the full development of septic shock. The response was measured not only with standard hemodynamic variables, like mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), but also with indices able to reflect vascular properties, such as the PP amplification, the Windkessel time constant tau, the harmonic distortion. Two distinct vascular responses to the insult up to the full development of septic shock, were identified, in an apparently homogeneous cohort. Indeed, the insult, the end point and the maneuvers were standardized according to factors that are typically used in sepsis trials. The results of the present study suggest that the cardiac response may play a greater role in one group of animals than in the other to compensate for a larger vascular alteration. However, further research is necessary to investigate the potential relationship between these trends and the administered therapy or inflammatory biomarkers.Clinical Relevance- These findings show how the response to an inflammatory response can produce different cardiovascular trends and this information can be used to guide the therapy."
41336559,Improving Machine Learning Models of Late-onset Sepsis Prediction Using Optimized Control Group Selection: A Comparative Study.,2025,"Late-onset sepsis (LOS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants due to their immature immune systems and the complex clinical environment of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Predictive models leveraging non-invasive vital sign data, such as heart rate variability (HRV), respiration and motion, have shown potential for early detection of LOS. However, the use of different control group selection strategies across LOS prediction studies, without any systematic comparison, has limited the potential to further improve the model performance. In this study, we evaluated three LOS prediction models trained using different control group selection strategies: 1) independent control, 2) intra-LOS control, and 3) a combined strategy. The training dataset included 128 preterm infants (60 LOS, 68 controls), while a independent test dataset of 49 patients (12 LOS, 37 non-LOS) was used for evaluation. The prediction performance of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) across varying prediction time windows. Our results showed that the combined strategy achieved the highest AUC (86.2%) within the 3-hour prediction window, outperforming the independent (70.9%) and intra-LOS (78.2%) strategies. While the independent strategy displayed the highest sensitivity and NPV, the intra-LOS approach offered better specificity and PPV. The combined strategy effectively integrated these strengths, offering superior predictive performance across key metrics. This study highlights the importance of control group selection in LOS model development and recommends the combined strategy as a promising approach for improving model performance.Clinical Relevance- This study highlights the impact of control group selection strategies on the predictive performance of LOS models, enhancing model generalizability in clinical LOS management."
41336403,naviDCN: Navigator-Guided Multi-Modal Deep Clustering for Sepsis Phenotyping in Early ICU Admission.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening and heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulated host responses to infection. Although recent studies applied unsupervised algorithms to uncover sepsis phenotypes, the clustering process lacks the ability to incorporate clinical knowledge, potentially resulting in phenotypes with limited interpretability. We propose a novel clustering framework, naviDCN, which integrates a navigator component to align clusters with clinical significance. The naviDCN architecture comprises multi-modal encoders, a deep clustering network (DCN) with reconstruction tasks, and a navigator module. We first encode electronic health records into representative embeddings by introducing an attention mechanism on multi-modal information. The framework then iteratively optimizes network weights of reconstruction and navigator modules, and updates cluster centroids of the clustering module. The navigator incorporates clinical knowledge into the embedding through backpropagation, thereby guiding clustering toward clinically meaningful outcomes. We discover four sepsis phenotypes with unique clinical characteristics, SOFA trajectories, and mortality patterns. Notably, while both alpha and delta phenotypes show severe conditions in the early stage, naviDCN effectively differentiates between patients likely to show clinical improvement (alpha) and those at risk of deterioration (delta).Furthermore, the navigator effectively enhances phenotype interpretability without compromising objective clustering performance. This study offers insights into understanding the heterogeneity of sepsis phenotypes.Clinical Relevance-This study integrates a navigator module into the clustering framework to identify phenotypes with distinct short-term organ dysfunction trajectories and long-term survival status, thus improving the interpretability of sepsis phenotypes. Unraveling the latent information in demographics, laboratory test results, and vital signs with deep learning, our framework identifies characteristic phenotypes and opens new avenues for exploring targeted treatment for sepsis patients across phenotypes."
41336241,Machine Learning-Based Adjudication of Acute Infection for Diagnostic Classifier Development with Silver-Standard Labels.,2025,"To produce training labels for diagnostic classifiers of acute infection for sepsis, an adjudication process involving manual chart review by one or more clinicians is current standard practice. This process is costly and varies from clinician to clinician. Acute infections can be difficult to definitively diagnose with resulting 'silver-standard' adjudications depending on clinician's subjective judgement. We leverage an international, multi-cohort dataset of multi-clinician-adjudicated acute infections to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based system for automated adjudication. We tested the performance and robustness to missing data of several off-the-shelf ML models in a benchmark study, tested the calibration of their output probabilities, and assessed what minimal set of features would be required to maintain performance in future studies. The resulting system, based on a logistic regression model, is accurate and well-calibrated enabling low-cost, reproducible and highly scalable adjudication of acute infection for downstream diagnostic classifier development.Clinical relevance-This work aims to automate the resource-intensive and variable process of chart review for adjudication of acute infection. Our approach makes adjudication of challenging, 'silver standard' acute infections reproducible and scalable to future studies, enabling more rapid, cost-effective incorporation of these studies in downstream development of diagnostic classifiers for sepsis. In addition, automating the chart review process could allow clinicians to spend more time on patient care."
41336043,Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy Coding of Video Motion Time Series for Late Onset Sepsis Detection in Neonatalogy.,2025,"Late-onset sepsis affects between 10 to 25% of very premature babies, standing as a primary contributor to neonatal mortality. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that relies solely on the analysis of newborns' motion, derived from the processing of videos acquired in neonatal intensive care units, for several consecutive days. Among a group of 16 very premature newborns, consisting of 8 sepsis and 8 control subjects, we initially extract 14 distinct motion features, in a total of 2636 hours of video recordings. These features are processed through a fusion of fuzzy spatio-temporal coding and smoothed principal component analysis. It leads to 16 trajectories, one per newborn, positioned differently in a 2D plane. They are then compared across parameters such as position, speed, and acceleration. Our findings underscore significant differences in 8 trajectory parameters between sepsis and control newborns. Finally, unsupervised classification was used to separate infected and healthy newborns using these parameters, achieving an accuracy of 81.3%.Clinical relevance- This approach offers a non invasive video-based motion method for early sepsis detection in premature newborns, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving neonatal outcomes."
41335109,Clinical impact of BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 implementation in patients with Staphylococcus bacteremia.,2026,"The BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) PCR panel allows for rapid identification of blood pathogens, including Staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus (SOSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). The objective of this study was to evaluate how BCID2 implementation impacted duration of vancomycin therapy, clinical outcomes, and rate of pharmacist intervention. This was a multi-center, retrospective study of adult patients admitted with MSSA or SOSA-positive blood cultures. The primary endpoint, days of vancomycin therapy, was compared between the pre- and post-BCID2 periods. Secondary endpoints included duration of MSSA bacteremia, hospital mortality, and pharmacist interventions. Of the 617 patients included in the primary analysis, MSSA bloodstream infection (BSI) accounted for 37.0% (110/297) and 31.6% (101/320) of the pre- and post-BCID2 group, respectively (P = 0.178). The median duration of vancomycin was 1.3 and 0.3 days in the pre- and post-BCID2 groups, respectively (absolute difference, 1.0 days; P < 0.001). The duration of MSSA BSI was 3.1 and 2.4 days in the pre- and post-BCID2 group, respectively (absolute difference, 0.7 days; P = 0.096). Hospital mortality was not different between periods (7.1% [21/297] vs 10.6% [34/320], P = 0.16). Pharmacists successfully intervened to reduce vancomycin duration in 7.1% (21/297) and 16.3% (52/320) of patients in the pre- and post-BCID2 group, respectively (P < 0.001). BCID2 implementation shortened the duration of vancomycin in patients with MSSA or SOSA bacteremia. These data support BCID2 as a critical tool to improve appropriate antibiotic selection and shorten the time to safer and more effective treatment for patients with SOSA and MSSA bacteremia. IMPORTANCE: PCR-based blood culture testing with concurrent antimicrobial stewardship program review continues to facilitate the initiation of pathogen-targeted antimicrobials in a shorter amount of time compared to traditional methods. The initiation of pathogen-targeted antimicrobials compared to non-pathogen-targeted antimicrobials has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in bloodstream infections caused by specific pathogens (e.g., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA]). Additionally, the adverse effects of vancomycin may be decreased with a shorter duration in blood culture contamination caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. This retrospective study evaluated the amount of time BCID2 results with pharmacist review and intervention reduced time to pathogen-targeted antimicrobials in MSSA, and time to discontinuation in blood culture contamination by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Secondary outcomes mainly evaluated the clinical effects of these interventions."
41334935,Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantification of Proteins and Post-Translational Modifications in Dried Blood: Longitudinal Sampling of Patients With Sepsis in Tanzania.,2025,"The proteomic analysis of blood is routine for disease phenotyping and biomarker development. Blood is commonly separated into soluble and cellular fractions. However, this can introduce pre-analytical variability, and analysis of a single component (which is common) may ignore important pathophysiology. We have recently developed methods for the facile processing of dried blood for mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome, N-glycoproteome, and phosphoproteome. Here, we applied this approach to 38 patients in Tanzania who presented to the hospital with sepsis. Blood was collected on Mitra devices at presentation and 1, 3, and 28-42 days post-enrollment. Processing of 96 total samples was performed in plate-based formats and completed within 2 days. Approximately 2000 protein groups and 8000 post-translational modifications were quantified in 3 LC-MS/MS runs at  approximately 1.5 h per sample. Analysis of differential abundance revealed blood proteome signatures of acute phase response and neutrophilic inflammation that partially resolved at the 28-42 day timepoint. Numerous analytes correlated with clinical laboratory values for c-reactive protein and white blood cell counts, as well as the Universal Vital Assessment illness severity score. These datasets serve as proof-of-concept for large-scale MS-based (sub)phenotyping of disease using dried blood and are available via the ProteomeXchange consortium (PXD060377). SUMMARY: For the first time, we report the integrated quantitative analysis of proteins, N-glycopeptides, and phosphopeptides from dried blood specimens in a disease context. Sample collection on Mitra devices is easily incorporated into existing biobanking protocols and provides a convenient solution for sample storage and preparation for downstream mass spectrometry analysis. Signatures of sepsis are reflected in each of the analyzed proteomes and decline between presentation to the hospital and 1 month post. In addition to well-described markers, these analyses identify mediators of inflammation and innate immune signaling that would be missed in the more common analysis of cell-free plasma."
41334563,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Sepsis and Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction.,2025,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by infection, which can result in multiple organ dysfunctions, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute lung injury (ALI), ultimately leading to patient mortality. The pathophysiology of sepsis is intricate, involving excessive immune activation, cytokine storms, endothelial damage, and microcirculatory dysfunction. Dysregulated host responses frequently give rise to severe complications, markedly elevating mortality rates. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures consisting of DNA, histones, and granular proteins, released by neutrophils upon activation. Ongoing research into NETs has uncovered their significant pathophysiological roles in clinical conditions, including sepsis. This review outlines the mechanisms of NET formation, release, classification, detection methods, and relevant biomarkers. Additionally, it delves into the signaling pathways involved in NET generation, their pathophysiological implications in sepsis and its complications, and evaluates their potential utility in clinical laboratory diagnostics."
41334245,"Comprehensive assessment of endothelial dysfunction before cellular therapy: EASIX, local imaging, and systemic biomarkers.",2025,"Endothelial dysfunction contributes to mortality after cellular therapies, yet its clinical assessment remains challenging. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated 169 patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and 102 healthy controls to determine whether a comprehensive endothelial profile, including the endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX), glycocalyx thickness (via sublingual GlycoCheck microscopy), digital perfusion (Tivita hyperspectral imaging), endothelial serum markers (angiopoietin-2, soluble thrombomodulin [CD141], chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9, interleukin-18, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), and platelet aggregation (flow cytometry), correlates with clinical outcomes. We observed significant intercorrelations among EASIX, perfused boundary region (PBR), tissue perfusion, and endothelial serum markers. Importantly, elevated EASIX, angiopoietin-2, impaired PBR, and reduced digital perfusion were significantly associated with early sepsis, whereas EASIX also independently predicted nonrelapse mortality. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of endothelial responses to systemic insult and reinforce the need for multimodal assessment in a larger study. EASIX, as a simple and routinely available marker, emerges as a valuable tool to stratify endothelial risk and guide monitoring in patients undergoing cellular therapy. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT05502887."
41333476,Comprehensive analysis of metabolism-related genes in sepsis reveals metabolic-immune heterogeneity and highlights GYG1 as a potential therapeutic target.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host immune responses, yet the metabolic drivers of immune dysfunction remain poorly understood. METHODS: Here we systematically profiled metabolism-related genes (MRGs) in sepsis using bulk transcriptomic data and stratified patients into two subgroups with distinct immune infiltration profiles by MRGs, as assessed by CIBERSORT and single-cell RNA-seq integration. Machine learning identified five hub metabolic genes for constructing a metabolic risk score, whose prognostic relevance was robustly validated in an external cohort. Single cell analyses, cell-cell communication, and cell-type-specific differential expression analyses were performed to dissect the immunological context. Finally, in vivo validation was conducted using an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. RESULTS: Patients in the high metabolic risk group exhibited a neutrophil-dominant and lymphocyte-suppressed immune landscape, consistent across bulk and single-cell analyses. Among the five hub genes (ALPL, CYP1B1, GYG1, OLAH, VNN1), GYG1 demonstrated the strongest predictive performance and was highly expressed in monocytes, neutrophils, and proliferating myeloid cells. High-risk patients displayed intensified monocyte-dendritic cell interactions and transcriptional programs enriched in neutrophil degranulation pathways. In vivo, Gyg1 was markedly upregulated in septic mice, and LNP-mediated siRNA knockdown of Gyg1 significantly improved survival in the LPS model. Mechanistically, Gyg1 knockdown significantly reduced glycogen content in myeloid cells, attenuated IL-6 and TNF-alpha production, alleviated LPS-induced neutrophil, and modestly decreased CD40 expression in monocytes and dendritic cells. These results collectively suggest that Gyg1 regulates metabolic fueling of inflammatory activation and intercellular communication during sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative multi-omics study established a robust immune-metabolic risk score system to predict sepsis patient outcomes and identified GYG1 as a metabolic driver of innate immune hyperactivation. Targeting GYG1 via LNP-siRNA delivery reduces glycogen availability and inflammatory output in myeloid cells, mitigating immune overactivation and improving disease outcomes in vivo, thereby highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target for sepsis."
41333439,Deep Learning for Time-Series Segmentation of Mechanical Ventilator Waveforms.,2025,"Accurate segmentation of ventilator waveforms is essential for detecting patient-ventilator asynchronies (PVAs), yet current heuristic methods can fail in noisy, real-world data. We developed and validated a deep learning model using a one-dimensional attention-gated U-Net architecture to identify inspiratory and expiratory onsets in mechanical ventilation waveforms. The model was trained and tested on 9,719 breaths from 33 patients and outperformed published rule-based methods, achieving F1 scores of > 0.99 for both inspiratory and expiratory onset detection within a 0.1-second tolerance window. Performance remained robust in asynchronous breaths (F1 >/= 0.98). When applied to quantify PVAs, the model reproduced reference standard asynchrony frequencies with no significant differences, whereas heuristic methods produced large deviations. Gradient-weighted class activation maps suggest that the model leveraged a diverse set of waveform features to inform segmentation. This computationally efficient model enables highly-accurate, real-time waveform analysis and provides a foundation for scalable, reproducible assessment of ventilator-patient interactions."
41333368,Expert insights: 10 key questions on managing common infections in cancer care in India.,2025,"Cancer patients are at a heightened risk of infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy, radiotherapy and the malignancy itself, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Effective infection management in this vulnerable population requires a systematic and timely approach to diagnosis and treatment. This review addresses ten critical questions concerning the management of infections in cancer patients, synthesising insights from clinical guidelines, expert opinions and current evidence. The review begins by discussing the optimal diagnostic workup for neutropenic patients, including investigations, risk stratification and treatment approaches for various neutropenia-specific syndromes. It further explores the principles of antibiotic escalation and de-escalation for gram-negative infections, emphasising the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. Advances in microbiological diagnostics, such as early detection methods and understanding resistance mechanisms in gram-negative organisms and Clostridioides difficile infections, are analysed in dedicated sections. The role of radiological investigations, which remain the cornerstone for diagnosing infections in immunocompromised patients, has been addressed. Catheter-related blood stream infection and the role of surveillance culture are explored in the final section. By addressing these critical questions, this review provides oncology clinicians with practical, evidence-based guidance for preventing, diagnosing and managing infections in cancer patients. The insights presented aim to enhance clinical outcomes and ensure patient safety in this high-risk population."
41332969,Traumatic colopleural fistula presenting as tension fecohemopneumothorax and septic shock: A case report.,2026,"A colopleural fistula represents a rare pathological communication between the colon and the pleural cavity, typically resulting from trauma, malignancy, or inflammatory bowel disease. One of the exceedingly rare complications of a fistula is fecopneumothorax, characterized by the presence of gas and fecal matter in the pleural space, which can lead to fatal sepsis if not diagnosed promptly. We report an instance of a traumatic colopleural fistula in a 49-year-old male who suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. Despite emergent surgical intervention and intensive critical care management, the patient developed a fecohemopneumothorax and ultimately died from septic shock. This case emphasizes the necessity for early radiologic evaluation for enterothoracic fistulas in trauma patients exhibiting persistent sepsis and abnormal thoracic drainage."

METHODS: Nine databases were searched (inception-May 2025). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (QUADAS-2). Bivariate models (STATA 18.0) generated pooled estimates. RESULTS: 15studies (1,338participants; 337 AKI cases) were included. Overall accuracy: Sensitivity 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.91), Specificity 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76-0.91), AUROC 0.91. Key subgroups: High-risk Neonates: AUROC 0.96, NLR 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02-0.78), Critically Ill/Sepsis: AUROC 0.88, NLR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.04-0.64), ELISA testing: Sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-0.96), NLR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.05-0.43); NephroCheck(R) Test: AUROC 0.79; Funnel plot asymmetry suggested publication bias.

41332235,Clinical Study evaluating the Diagnostic Value of Cardiac Ultrasound Parameters Combined With Serum miR-324-3p in Septic Cardiac Dysfunction.,2025,"Ultrasonic examinations showed significant limitations in the early detection and prognostic prediction of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), needing assisting biomarkers. The diagnostic and prognostic potential of miR-324-3p in SIMD was evaluated in this study, aiming to explore a novel biomarker. The functional role of miR-324-3p in regulating myocardial cell injury was assessed in H9c2 cells. The study enrolled 210 sepsis patients, including 98 patients diagnosed with SIMD. The significance of miR-324-3p in SIMD risk prediction, screening, and prognosis prediction was evaluated. Moreover, ultrasonic parameters, involving LVEF, LVDd, LAD, and FS, were compared between sepsis and SIMD patients, and the diagnostic and prognostic values of these parameters were also assessed. Silencing miR-324-3p exerted significantly protective effects on myocardial cell injury. Increasing serum miR-324-3p was observed in SIMD patients and was positively correlated with Dallas grades. LVEF, LVDd, LAD, and FS also showed significance in discriminating SIMD patients, but a single parameter cannot possess both satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. Serum miR-324-3p could help improve the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ultrasonic parameters in screening SIMD, and miR-324-3p was also identified as an independent risk factor for the adverse prognosis of SIMD patients."
41332045,Severe cutaneous adverse reaction to amoxicillin-clavulanate: Pediatric toxic epidermal necrolysis in the Gulf: A case report and literature review.,2025,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and both are rare blistering skin reactions triggered by drugs and illnesses. CASE PRESENTATION: We have reported a case of a previously healthy five-year-old boy who presented with a maculopapular rash covering more than 90 % of the total body surface area (TBSA), bilateral conjunctivitis, and oral thrush five days after receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate for upper respiratory infection. On assessment, dehydrated, hemodynamically unstable with extensive, dark maculopapular rash covering approximately 90 % of the total body surface area, skin biopsy confirmed full-thickness epidermal necrosis with lymphocytic dermal infiltration consistent with TEN. The patient was managed in the pediatric intensive care unit with rehydration, immediate cessation of the culprit drugs, surgical debridement, and aggressive wound care, as well as Intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroids, and meropenem for sepsis prophylaxis. Despite the patient developing complications (respiratory distress syndrome necessitating 9-day mechanical ventilation), the reepithelialization began by day ten, and the patient was extubated after 80 % wound healing. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case discusses Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a rare and severe skin response caused by amoxicillin-clavulanate exposure in a pediatric patient. Early clinical diagnosis confirmed by skin biopsy and immediate management with supportive care, corticosteroids, and intensive wound care contributed to full recovery despite involvement of more than 90 % of the body. CONCLUSION: Though TEN remains a medical emergency, even in severe cases, the timely and multidisciplinary approach can have a good outcome. It is a clinical reminder for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion of drug-induced severe cutaneous reactions, especially in children."
41331972,Safety and Clinical Outcome of Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in an Asian Population: A Prospective Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) in Asian patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) due to smaller body build. METHODS: We performed a 2 year prospective study in 5 Asian cities from May 2017 to May 2018 to investigate the safety and feasibility of S-ICD for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in an Asian population. RESULTS: We enrolled 75 S-ICD recipients (77% males; age 49.6 +/- 16.8 years) with a mean BMI of 24.6 +/- 5.0 (range 15.9-40.9) with 67% (50/75) with BMI </= 23. The indications of S-ICD were primary and secondary prevention in 26 (35%) and 49 (65%) patients, respectively. Among them, 51 patients suffer from ischemic (30, 59%) or nonischemic (21, 41%) cardiomyopathy, and 25 patients have channelopathies. Their mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 44.4 +/- 15.1%. All patients had successful S-ICD implantation with a mean procedural duration of 75.5 +/- 28.1 min using conscious sedation in majority of patients (65/75, 87%); and defibrillation testing was performed in 62 patients (83%). After 2 years of follow-up, 8 patients developed serious adverse events, including 4 deaths (2 asystole, 1 sepsis, 1 myocardial infarction), 2 ventricular tachycardia storm, 1 pocket infection, and 1 lead failure requiring replacement. Both patients with ventricular tachycardia storm received appropriate shocks, and no patient developed inappropriate shocks. CONCLUSIONS: S-ICD implantation for both primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death was found to be safe in an Asian population, including those with a low BMI, and was associated with a low rate of device-related complications."
41331894,[Research progress on the relationship between lactate-related indicators and sepsis].,2025,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis. However, sepsis remains the main cause of high mortality among critically ill patients worldwide. Early diagnosis, timely treatment, and accurate prediction of the prognosis are crucial for the successful treatment of septic patients. Lactic acid not only serves as a diagnostic indicator for septic shock but also participates in the immune response process of sepsis. It regulates gene epigenetic regulation through lactylation, thereby affecting the expression of related genes, cellular metabolism, and the immune response of the body. Therefore, it may become a new target for the treatment of sepsis. Lactate-related indicators, such as lactic acid/albumin ratio (LAR) and lactic acid/hematocrit ratio (LHR), also have important value in the prognosis assessment of septic patients and are superior to the evaluation efficacy of a single indicator. This is of great significance for timely detection of the changes in the condition of septic patients and their risk stratification and precise treatment. This review focused on the relationship between lactylation, lactatization, lactate-related indicators and sepsis, as well as the latest research progress. By revealing their roles in the occurrence, development and prognosis of sepsis, it provided new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment, uncovered new mechanisms of disease onset, guided disease risk stratification, optimized existing treatment strategies, and also offered new references and directions for basic research on lactate-related indicators."
41331889,[Establishment and evaluation of a machine learning prediction model for sepsis-related encephalopathy in the elderly].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To construct machine learning prediction model for sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), and analyze the application value of the model on early identification of SAE risk in elderly septic patients. METHODS: Patients aged over 60 years with a primary diagnosis of sepsis admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 2008 to 2023 were selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2). Demographic variables, disease severity scores, comorbidities, interventions, laboratory indicators, and hospitalization details were collected. Key factors associated with SAE were identified using univariate Logistic regression analysis. The data were randomly divided into training and validation sets in a 7 : 3 ratio. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was conducted in the training set and visualized using a nomogram model for prediction of SAE. The discrimination of the model was evaluated in the validation set using the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), and its calibration was assessed using calibration curve. Furthermore, multiple machine learning algorithms, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), naive bayes (NB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), were constructed in the training set. Their predictive performance was subsequently evaluated on the validation set. Taking the XGB model as an example, the interpretability of the model through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was enhanced to identify the key predictive factors and their contributions. RESULTS: A total of 2 204 septic patients were finally enrolled, of whom 840 developed SAE (38.1%). A total of 21 variables associated with SAE were screened through univariate Logistic regression analysis. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that endotracheal intubation [odds ratio (OR) = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.19-0.88, P < 0.001], oxygen therapy (OR = 0.76, 95%CI was 0.53-0.95, P = 0.023), tracheotomy (OR = 0.20, 95%CI was 0.07-0.53, P < 0.001), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT; OR = 0.32, 95%CI was 0.15-0.70, P < 0.001), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 0.31, 95%CI was 0.16-0.60, P < 0.001), rheumatic disease (OR = 0.44, 95%CI was 0.19-0.99, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.68, 95%CI was 0.54-0.86, P = 0.001), and maximum anion gap (AG; OR = 0.95, 95%CI was 0.93-0.97, P < 0.001) were associated with an decreased probability of SAE, and age (OR = 1.05, 95%CI was 1.03-1.06, P < 0.001), acute physiology score III (APSIII; OR = 1.02, 95%CI was 1.01-1.02, P < 0.001), Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS; OR = 1.04, 95%CI was 1.03-1.06, P < 0.001), and length of hospital stay (OR = 1.01, 95%CI was 1.01-1.02, P < 0.001) were associated with an increased probability of SAE. A nomogram model was constructed based on these variables. In the validation set, ROC curve analysis showed that the model achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.723, and the calibration curve showed good consistency between the predicted probability of the model and the observed probability. Among the machine learning algorithms, including MLP, SVM, NB, GBM, RF, and XGB, the SVM model and RF model demonstrated relatively good predictive performance, with AUC of 0.748 and 0.739, respectively, and the sensitivity was both exceeding 85%. The predictive performance of the XGB model was explained through SHAP analysis, and the results indicated that APSIII score (SHAP value was 0.871), age (SHAP value was 0.521), and OASIS score (SHAP value was 0.443) were important factors affecting the predictive performance of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning-based SAE prediction model exhibits good predictive capability and holds significant application value for the early identification of SAE risk in elderly septic patients."
41331885,[A nomogram model for predicting the 28-day death of patients with septic shock based on serum growth differentiation factor 11 and killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 was constructed].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To observe change in serum growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (KLRB1), to construct a nomogram model for 28-day death in patients with septic shock, and to explore its predictive value. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. The patients with septic shock admitted to the emergency intensive care unit (ICU) of Cangzhou Central Hospital from September 2023 to March 2025 were selected as the septic shock group, the patients with sepsis admitted to the emergency general ward during the same period were selected as the sepsis group, and healthy individuals undergoing physical examination during the same period were selected as the control group. On the day of hospital admission or physical examination for the research subjects, the levels of serum GDF11 and KLRB1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patients with septic shock were divided into survival and death groups based on their 28-day survival status. The patients' gender, age, past medical history, infection site, severity of illness, mechanical ventilation, blood purification, infection indicators, biochemical indicators, coagulation function indicators, and blood lactic acid (Lac) were collected. The clinical data of the patients with septic shock between the two groups with different prognoses were compared. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors for 28-day death in patients with septic shock, and bivariate Pearson correlation analysis was conducted. A nomogram model was constructed based on the risk factors for 28-day death in patients with septic shock. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram model were evaluated using the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and calibration curve. The clinical utility of the model was evaluated using clinical decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A total of 168 patients in the emergency ICU were enrolled in the septic shock group, 40 patients in the emergency general ward were enrolled in the sepsis group, and 40 healthy individuals were enrolled in the control group. Compared with the healthy control group, the serum GDF11 levels in the sepsis and septic shock groups were significantly increased (mug/L: 13.09+/-3.51, 19.28+/-5.36 vs. 4.17+/-0.92, both P < 0.05), and the serum KLRB1 levels were significantly decreased (ng/L: 57.36+/-11.28, 45.52+/-9.07 vs. 84.19+/-17.16, both P < 0.05), with more significant changes in the septic shock group (both P < 0.05). Among the 168 patients with septic shock, 96 survived and 72 died within 28 days. Compared with the survival group, the serum GDF11 level in the death group was significantly increased (mug/L: 24.24+/-4.81 vs. 15.56+/-4.62, P < 0.05), and the serum KLRB1 level was significantly decreased (ng/L: 28.53+/-8.69 vs. 58.26+/-9.45, P < 0.05). There were also statistically significant differences in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) score, procalcitonin (PCT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, and Lac between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that SOFA score [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.38-3.65), Lac (OR = 1.38, 95%CI was 1.09-2.01), GDF11 (OR = 1.54, 95%CI was 1.21-2.33) and KLRB1 (OR = 0.64, 95%CI was 0.41-0.78) were independent risk factors for 28-day death in patients with septic shock (all P < 0.05). Bivariate Pearson correlation analysis showed that SOFA score was significantly positively correlated with Lac and GDF11 (r value was 0.37 and 0.58, respectively, both P < 0.05), and significantly negatively correlated with KLRB1 (r = -0.72, P < 0.05). A nomogram model was constructed based on the risk factors for 28-day death in patients with septic shock. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the nomogram model for predicting 28-day death in patients with septic shock was 0.963 (95%CI was 0.929-0.990), indicating that the model had good discrimination and predictive ability. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (chi (2) = 9.578, P = 0.295) and calibration curve indicated that the predicted values of the model were in good agreement with the actual values. DCA indicated that the model provided a high net benefit for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The serum GDF11 level was significantly increased and the KLRB1 level was significantly decreased in patients with septic shock. The nomogram model based on GDF11 and KLRB1 could more accurately evaluate the 28-day death of patients with septic shock."
41331622,"Five-year surveillance of antimicrobial resistance patterns among blood culture isolates at the University Teaching Hospital, Kigali, Rwanda.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) complicating treatment options. This study aimed to describe the frequency, distribution, and patterns of AMR among blood culture isolates over 5 years at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, in Rwanda. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional surveillance analysis was performed on 1352 bacterial isolates from 8301 blood cultures conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024. The distribution of pathogens, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and comparisons of resistance patterns between isolates from outpatient and hospitalized patients were analyzed using SPSS version 28. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (37.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.4%), Escherichia coli (13%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (11.6%). Nearly all isolates originated from inpatients (98.6%), with the pediatric unit accounting for 40.7%. Alarmingly high resistance rates were observed for ampicillin (94.2%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (92.5%), third-generation cephalosporins (79-86%), and ciprofloxacin (58.7%). Notably, vancomycin (1%) for Gram-positive bacteria, and polymyxin B (27.1%), imipenem (25.5%), and amikacin (15.6%) for Gram-negative bacteria generally exhibited lower resistance rates. Additionally, AMR was significantly more prevalent in isolates from hospitalized patients compared to ambulatory patients (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a substantial burden of AMR in blood culture isolates, particularly affecting hospitalized and pediatric patients. The high resistance rates to commonly used antibiotics highlight an urgent need for strengthened antimicrobial stewardship programs, improved infection prevention measures, and enhanced diagnostic laboratory capacity to guide therapy."
41331561,Diagnosis of esophageal pleural fistula via metagenomic next-generation sequencing of pleural effusion: a case report.,2025,"Esophageal injury is a rare and life-threatening event. Esophageal perforation can rapidly contaminate the neck, mediastinum, pleural cavity, or abdominal cavity, leading to sepsis or septic shock. Its high complication and mortality rates are often associated with adjacent organ damage and/or delays in diagnosis or definitive treatment. We present a case of a patient who developed esophago pleural fistula(EPF) due to traumatic fall. A 64-year-old man presented with respiratory sepsis after a traumatic fall. Imaging demonstrated a massive pleural effusion. The initial lung CT did not reveal any abnormal communication between the esophagus and the pleural cavity. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of pleural fluid revealed a microbial profile overwhelmingly composed of typical oropharyngeal flora, which was highly suggestive of an aero-digestive fistula. Subsequent gastroscopy and contrast examination confirmed a fistula between the distal esophagus and the left pleural cavity through a ruptured diaphragm. The patient underwent conservative treatment. A persistent effusion with a history of blunt thoracoabdominal trauma may raise suspicion for EPF, which, if not diagnosed promptly, may result in significant morbidity. This case provides new insights for diagnosing EPF following blunt trauma. Interpreting key subtle clues in pleural fluid analysis and imaging can lead to a timely diagnosis and thus improves morbidity and mortality of EPF.

41331421,"Genetic disorders and associated morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies in preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Genetic disorders are recognized as key contributors to morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies in term infants. However, the rates of diagnosis and association with morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies in preterm infants are poorly characterized. We sought to determine rates of diagnosis of genetic disorders in preterm infants and to define the association of genetic disorders with morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational cohort study conducted in neonatal intensive care units in the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse. Infants born from 23 to 0/7 to 33 and 6/7 weeks of gestation, admitted to 374 U.S. community and academic neonatal intensive care units from 2000 to 2020 were included. Infants transferred after birth or prior to discharge were excluded. We analyzed diagnosis of genetic disorders; predischarge morbidity (including acute kidney injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, shock, severe retinopathy, and intracranial hemorrhage); mortality; and presence of congenital anomalies. RESULTS: Among 323,770 early preterm infants analyzed, 4,196 (1.3%) were diagnosed with one of twenty genetic disorders. Single gene disorders were identified in 2,250 (0.7%) infants, copy number variants in 88 (0.03%) infants, and aneuploidies in 1,885 (0.6%) infants. Morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies occurred in 1,319 (31.4%), 566 (13.5%), and 1,041 (24.8%) infants with genetic disorders compared to 77,957 (24.5%), 15,240 (4.7%), and 9,455 (3.0%) infants without genetic disorders. Common aneuploidies accounted for most of these associations. However, morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies were also significantly more common in early preterm infants with single gene disorders and pathogenic copy number variants. We did not detect meaningful differences in diagnostic rates of genetic disorders over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: 1.3% of early preterm infants were diagnosed with genetic disorders. Genetic disorders were strongly associated with morbidity, mortality, and congenital anomalies. Clinicians should strongly consider genetic evaluation in early preterm infants with morbidity, mortality, or congenital anomalies. Prospective research is needed to determine the true prevalence of genetic disorders in this high-risk population."
41329523,Longitudinal multiomic signatures of ARDS and sepsis inflammatory phenotypes identify pathways associated with mortality.,2026,"BACKGROUNDCritically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis exhibit distinct inflammatory phenotypes with divergent clinical outcomes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenotypes, derived from clinical data and protein biomarkers, were associated with metabolic differences in a pilot study.METHODSWe performed integrative multiomics analysis of blood samples from 160 patients with ARDS in the ROSE trial, randomly selecting 80 patients from each latent class analysis-defined inflammatory phenotype (hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory) with phenotype probability greater than 0.9. Untargeted plasma metabolomics and whole-blood transcriptomics at day 0 and day 2 were analyzed using multimodal factor analysis (MEFISTO). The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, with validation in an independent critically ill sepsis cohort (EARLI).RESULTSMultiomics integration revealed 4 molecular signatures associated with mortality: (a) enhanced innate immune activation coupled with increased glycolysis (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), (b) hepatic dysfunction and immune dysfunction paired with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), (c) interferon program suppression coupled with altered mitochondrial respiration (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), and (d) redox impairment and cell proliferation pathways (not associated with inflammatory phenotype). These signatures persisted through day 2 of trial enrollment. Within-phenotype analysis revealed distinct mortality-associated pathways in each group. All molecular signatures were validated in the independent EARLI cohort.CONCLUSIONInflammatory phenotypes of ARDS reflect distinct underlying biological processes with both phenotype-specific and phenotype-independent pathways influencing patient outcomes, all characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for precise treatment strategies in critical illness.FUNDINGNIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Institute of General Medical Sciences."
41329233,Narrative review on microbiota and sepsis: the host's betrayal?,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota, long considered a ""less relevant"" to human body health, it plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Disruption of the host-microbe balance contributes to impaired barrier integrity, microbial translocation, and dysregulated immune responses. This perspective raises the possibility that dysbiosis is not merely a consequence of critical illness, rather an active driver of septic progression. This narrative review explores the relationship between sepsis and gut microbiome. PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from inception to September 2025. Recent studies have highlighted the triangular interplay between the intestinal barrier, gut microbiota, and immune system. Altered microbial composition and increased permeability foster systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. Biomarkers such as diamine oxidase and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein are emerging as promising indicators of gut injury. Experimental therapies (i.e., faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and personalized antibiotic regimens guided by microbial profiling) provide potential to modulate host-microbe interactions. Integration of microbiome analysis with multi-omics and advanced bioinformatics may enable stratification of septic patients by microbial signatures, paving the way for precision medicine approaches. Modulation of gut microbiota represents a novel therapeutic frontier in sepsis. Conceptualizing sepsis as a disease of disrupted host-microbe symbiosis may unravel new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Future research should aim at prioritizing high-quality trials, innovative designs, and equitable implementation to target microbiota to improve survival and recovery in patients with sepsis."
41328770,Hospitalizations during the 30-day period preceding admission with pulmonary embolism: insights from the National Readmission Database.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine the frequency and causes of hospitalizations prior to an admission with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the United States National Readmission Database (NRD) from 2018 to 2020 to evaluate hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of PE and in-hospital outcomes. We identified the number and causes of hospital admissions occurring within the 30 days preceding the PE hospitalization. Factors associated with prior hospitalization and in-hospital mortality during PE admission were examined. This analysis describes the characteristics of PE patients with prior hospitalization but does not assess risk. RESULTS: A total of 2,651,870 hospital admissions for PE were included in the analysis, of which 16.3% (n = 431,700) had a prior hospitalization within the preceding 30 days. The most common reason for prior admission was sepsis (10.9%). Other notable but less frequent causes included orthopedic conditions associated with reduced mobility, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. The strongest predictor of prior hospitalization was elective admission (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.82-2.95). Additional factors associated with increased odds of prior hospitalization included cancer (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.57-1.63), prior myocardial infarction (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.20-1.28), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.17-1.21). Prior hospitalization was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality during the PE admission (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.89-2.00). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in six patients admitted with PE had a hospitalization in the preceding 30 days, and these patients experienced higher in-hospital mortality. Common reasons for prior admissions included sepsis, orthopedic conditions related to immobility, cancer, and cardiovascular disease."
41328722,Hemostatic abnormalities at the time of fetal death: A retrospective study evaluating the prevalence and relevance of targeted testing.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of hemostasis abnormalities at the time of fetal death diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included all fetal deaths between 22 and 42 weeks from July 2017 to December 2023, excluding multiple pregnancies, patients on anticoagulant therapy, and those with known pre-existing coagulation disorders. Hemostatic abnormalities were classified as: (1) probable disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), defined by a modified International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) probability score above 25, and (2) confirmed DIC, requiring clinical diagnosis with transfusion, intensive care admission, or maternal death. To evaluate this score and hemostasis abnormalities, platelet count, prothrombin time difference (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen level are described. Maternal characteristics and obstetrical history were evaluated to identify a high-risk of DIC situation such as sepsis, placenta abruption and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Etiology of fetal death are also described, searching for a vascular etiology. Cases of confirmed DIC are detailed. RESULTS: Among 163 cases of fetal death, 12 women (7.4%) had probable DIC, and three women (1.8%) had confirmed DIC. When the initial blood test was normal, none of the subsequent blood tests revealed any abnormalities. The main causes of fetal death included vascular-related intrauterine growth restriction (42%), unexplained deaths (19%) and fetal malformations (14%). Two cases of confirmed DIC were associated with retroplacental hematomas, while the third involved severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with pathologic uterine Dopplers, suggesting a vascular etiology. CONCLUSION: The risk of confirmed DIC in the context of fetal death is low (1.8%) and primarily associated with retroplacental or vascular pathologies. These findings support a selective approach to hemostasis testing based on clinical context rather than routine systematic testing."
41328151,Post-surgical Autopsy Findings: Insights Into Forensic Evaluation and Surgical Complications.,2025,"This systematic review examined the role of autopsy in identifying fatal surgical complications and diagnostic discrepancies across diverse contexts over the past decade. A structured search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists identified 252 records, from which 11 studies were included after rigorous screening. The evidence base encompassed retrospective cohorts, single-case reports, experimental animal studies, and archaeological analyses, reflecting heterogeneous designs, populations, and surgical contexts. Major discrepancies between clinical diagnoses and autopsy findings were observed in up to 47% of cases, most frequently involving hemorrhage, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and anastomotic leaks. While autopsy consistently clarified causes of death and provided critical insights for patient safety and medicolegal accountability, the overall certainty of evidence was moderate to low due to study heterogeneity, publication bias, and variable reporting quality. These findings underscore the persistent gap between perioperative expectations and actual outcomes and highlight the irreplaceable role of autopsy in quality improvement, risk reduction, and forensic practice. The next step in research should focus on standardized guidelines, strong multicentric partnerships, and follow-ups to more effectively incorporate autopsy data on surgical safety planning and training. The synthesis proves that autopsy is a valuable, underused instrument of enhancing care, transparency, and evidence-based practice in contemporary healthcare systems."
41328081,Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in a Patient With Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: A Case of Insidious Progression and Hematologic Complications.,2025,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe condition characterized by systemic activation of coagulation, resulting in the formation of microthrombi and consumption of clotting factors, leading to a paradoxical risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Early diagnosis is crucial to initiating appropriate treatment before the condition worsens, as DIC is often associated with a poor prognosis once clinical signs appear. This case report presents a 60-year-old female patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma, initially diagnosed two years prior, who developed acute DIC shortly before her death. Despite an initial presentation of intractable back pain, nausea, and generalized weakness, laboratory findings demonstrated hemolytic anemia and abnormal coagulation, leading to the diagnosis of consumptive coagulopathy secondary to her advanced malignancy. The patient's declining condition was accompanied by worsening laboratory parameters, including elevated prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), and fibrin degradation products, highlighting the insidious progression of DIC in cancer patients, particularly in the context of adenocarcinoma. Although treated with supportive care, including blood transfusions and withdrawal of anticoagulation, she ultimately succumbed to cardiopulmonary arrest. This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of DIC in oncology patients, especially those with advanced-stage malignancies, as it often manifests in a less aggressive yet equally fatal form compared to DIC seen in conditions such as sepsis or trauma. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for vigilant laboratory monitoring in critically ill cancer patients to facilitate timely intervention."
41327646,An expanding abdominal aorta ulcer as a rare complication of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis in a hemodialysis patient: A case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis are at high risk of severe infections. The co-occurrence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and penetrating aortic ulcer in this population is rare, posing notable therapeutic challenges. METHODS: A case of a 73-year-old male end-stage renal disease hemodialysis patient was analyzed. The patient presented with left flank pain, nausea, and anorexia. Diagnoses and treatment adjustments were based on laboratory tests, computed tomography angiography, and serial monitoring of biomarkers and imaging. RESULTS: Laboratory tests showed severe inflammation (white blood cell: 23.95 x 10(9)/L; C-reactive protein: 196.06 mg/L; procalcitonin: 21.15 ng/mL) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia. computed tomography angiography revealed abdominal aortic ulcer with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initial meropenem/linezolid was switched to vancomycin post-culture; further adjustment to piperacillin-tazobactam/moxifloxacin followed ulcer progression. The patient refused surgery, received conservative treatment, and had Candida albicans superinfection on hospital day 20 (treated with fluconazole). He was discharged with reduced inflammatory markers and resolved symptoms, but follow-up showed ulcer expansion with hematoma (high rupture risk). CONCLUSION: Aortic infections in dialysis patients are therapeutically challenging. Serial biomarker monitoring and imaging are crucial for detecting disease progression, even with improved clinical symptoms."
41327452,Cell-free DNA in sepsis: from molecular insights to clinical management.,2025,"Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that frequently results in fatal multiple organ dysfunction. Despite advances in clinical identification and management, both its incidence and mortality have remained persistently high. Emerging evidence indicates that cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as a novel biomarker and molecular therapeutic target, holds promise for improving the clinical management of sepsis. cfDNA refers to DNA fragments present in body fluids, including naked DNA, membrane-coated DNA, nucleosomes, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). cfDNA is released from host cells or pathogens into body fluids through pathways, such as NETosis, mitochondrial damage, cell necrosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and erythroblast enucleation. The released cfDNA triggers a strong inflammatory response by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome, and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. At the same time, cfDNA activates the coagulation cascade and inhibits anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems through multiple mechanisms, resulting in microcirculatory disorders. These pathological effects are closely associated with sepsis-related organ dysfunction and poor prognosis. Elucidation of the release and pathological mechanisms of cfDNA provides a foundation for the development of targeted treatment strategies. Currently, molecular therapeutic approaches targeting cfDNA, including peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) 4 inhibitors, pore-forming inhibitors, antioxidants, cfDNA scavengers, and deoxyribonucleases (DNases), have shown certain efficacy in treating sepsis and systemic inflammation. In terms of sepsis monitoring, compared with traditional markers, cfDNA exhibits extremely high timeliness and dynamic monitoring capability. cfDNA can simultaneously indicate the complex interplay among infection, host response, and organ damage, making it suitable for early diagnosis, prognosis assessment, treatment monitoring, organ function evaluation, and pathogen detection. Given its broad application prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, this paper systematically elaborates on the mechanisms of cfDNA release and pathological effects in sepsis, reviews progress in cfDNA-targeted monitoring and therapeutic strategies, discusses technical challenges, and outlines potential future directions."
41327338,Association of the atherogenic index of plasma with in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Few inexpensive early parameters are available to describe sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) in practice. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP = log(1)(0)[TG/HDL-C]) integrates triglyceride excess and HDL-C depletion-metabolic shifts implicated in endothelial injury and thrombosis. We evaluated the association between the AIP and in-hospital mortality in patients with SIC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with SIC admitted to the ICU of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (2017-2023). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic models adjusted sequentially for age/sex and Boruta/LASSO-selected covariates (age, SOFA score, albumin, sodium, potassium, ventilation, and renal diseases) plus major comorbidities. Dose-response was assessed by restricted cubic splines. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different SIC criteria and alternative adjustment strategies to verify robustness. Machine learning (CatBoost, RF, LR, and MLP) classifiers were compared for discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: 1096 patients were included. Higher baseline AIP was associated with increased mortality across models (per-SD OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.53, fully adjusted). Restricted cubic splines supported an approximately linear association. The logistic model reached an AUROC of 0.71 in the test set, with a positive net benefit on decision curve analysis. Additional machine-learning models showed comparable discrimination in the test set (AUROC around 0.70). SHAP analysis indicated that ventilation contributed most strongly to model predictions, with AIP also emerging as an important prognostic feature. CONCLUSIONS: A higher AIP is linked to increasing in-hospital mortality in SIC patients, which aligns with the metabolic-vascular disturbances that the AIP captures. When used as a complementary measure, the AIP may aid early clinical appraisal without implying stand-alone prognostication.

41327141,Birth weight and neonatal morbidity as early-life risk factors for childhood cancer: a nationwide cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer is a significant public health issue, and growing evidence suggests that perinatal factors such as birth weight and neonatal complications may influence cancer risk. However, the potential impact of neonatal interventions on subsequent cancer development remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between birth weight and childhood cancer risk, and how this relationship may be modulated by neonatal morbidities and interventions. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study using the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. All live births between 2008 and 2014 were included and categorized by birth weight. Cancer incidence was identified through 2018 using ICD-10 codes. Associations between birth weight, neonatal conditions, neonatal interventions, and cancer outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Among over 2.9 million children, low birth weight (LBW) infants-particularly those weighing < 1.0 kg-had a significantly increased risk of childhood cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.03). Distinct cancer patterns were observed by birth weight category: hepatoblastoma was most common in infants < 1.5 kg, central nervous system malignancies in those 1.5-2.4 kg, and leukemia in those > 4.0 kg. In LBW infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (aOR, 2.21), sepsis (aOR, 1.56), oxygen exposure >/= 4 days (aOR, 1.32), and >/= 3 red blood cell transfusions (aOR, 4.03) were significantly associated with increased cancer risk. In contrast, phototherapy and radiography were not found to be associated with cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that both birth weight extremes and neonatal exposures contribute to childhood cancer risk. In particular, conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and sepsis-and interventions including oxygen therapy and transfusions-may influence oncogenic pathways in LBW infants. Long-term follow-up in high-risk neonatal populations is warranted, along with further research into underlying biological mechanisms."
41327117,Surveillance of bloodstream infections in pediatric patients for 11 years: what was the COVID-19 impact?,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although frequently studied in adults, data on pediatric patients remain limited. This study evaluated the epidemiology of BSIs in children from 2013 to 2023, associating antibacterial consumption with bacterial resistance, including comparisons between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods in a Brazilian teaching hospital. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed 15.369 blood cultures (BC) collected from patients under 18 years old between January 2013 and December 2023. All positive BC were included. Blood samples were incubated using the BACTEC system. Species identification and antibacterial susceptibility testing were performed via the BD-Phoenix system. A PCR-based assay was used to detect carbapenemase-encoding genes in Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Data analysis was performed using Microsoft(R) Excel(R). RESULTS: A total of 266 isolates were recovered from 224 pediatric patients. Of these, 138 (51.9%) were Gram-positive cocci (GPC), 105 (39.5%) were GNB and 21 (7.9%) were Fungi. Infants (< 1 year) represented the majority of cases (143/224; 63.8%) with GPC predominating (59.6%), especially S. epidermidis (46/166; 28%). GPCs were also predominant in adolescents (13 to < 18 years; 50%). GNBs were more frequent in the 1-6 and 7-12-year groups, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the most common (13.6% and 5.6%, respectively), including one bla(NDM)-positive isolate identified during the pandemic. Fungal species were detected only after 2015, with Candida genus representing over 95% of the cases. The most common fungi were Candida parapsilosis (47.6%), followed by Candida tropicalis (19.0%) and Candida albicans (19.0%), while other species such as C. lusitaneae, C. rugosa and Kodamaea ohmeri represented 14.4% of isolates. Most fungal isolates (47.6%) were from patients aged < 1 year and admitted in the pediatric-intensive care unit. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed increased MICs(90) values in 2022-2023, particularly for meropenem and ceftriaxone coinciding with increased consumption of these antimicrobials during this period. CONCLUSIONS: While the COVID-19 pandemic did not alter the overall bacterial trends in pediatric BSIs, it was associated with the emergence of fungal infections and rising MICs-even in the absence of increasing resistance rates. These findings reinforce the importance for continuous AMR surveillance in pediatric populations."
41327010,"Bacterial-associated bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients in Lagos, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial-associated bloodstream infections (BSIs) pose a significant health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where diagnostic delays and antimicrobial resistance exacerbate outcomes. This study investigated the prevalence, clinical correlates, bacterial aetiology, and resistance profiles of BSIs among hospitalised febrile patients in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 2,940 blood samples were collected from febrile inpatients across five healthcare centres between 2018 and 2023. Standard microbiological techniques and mass spectrometry were employed for bacterial identification. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed following CLSI guidelines. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, regression modelling, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: Of the 2,940 samples, 307 (10.44%) were culture-positive, with gram-negative bacteria accounting for 91.8% of isolates. Proteus spp., Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. were the most prevalent pathogens. Septicaemia, bradycardia, and extreme age groups (0-10, >/= 41 years) were significantly associated with BSIs (p < 0.0001). Multidrug resistance was highest in P. vulgaris (32.7%) and E. coli (27.9%). A strong correlation (R = 0.76) was observed between clinical diagnosis and culture positivity. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal a high burden of gram-negative bloodstream infections predominantly caused by Proteus spp., E. coli, and Klebsiella spp., with significant multidrug resistance, particularly in P. vulgaris and E. coli, and strong associations with septicaemia, bradycardia, extreme age groups, and clinical diagnoses."
41326834,"Impact of resuscitation fluids in the pediatric emergency department on length of stay, electrolyte balance, and kidney function.",2025,"The optimal resuscitation fluid in pediatric emergency departments remains unresolved. Balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate, have emerged as alternatives to the long-standing use of normal saline; however, existing studies have not demonstrated significant differences in clinical outcomes. This study aimed to assess the clinical impact of transitioning from normal saline to Ringer's lactate solution in the pediatric emergency department, primarily in terms of length of hospital stay, alongside kidney functions and biochemical measures. We conducted a prospective study comparing clinical outcomes of a transition from normal saline to Ringer's lactate for resuscitation boluses. Each of the two study groups included 107 pediatric patients. A mean of 42 mL/kg was administered as a fluid bolus in the normal saline and Ringer's lactate groups (42.04 vs 42.1 mL/kg respectively). The most common diagnosis was fluid losses, followed by sepsis (81% vs 83% and 13% vs 11% respectively). Notably, the length of stay was significantly shorter in the Ringer's lactate group (2.6 days) compared to the normal saline group (3.4 days). No significant differences were observed in acid-base balance, electrolyte levels, or kidney function indicators. These findings were consistent among a subset of patients with acute kidney injury at admission. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Ringer's lactate resulted in a shorter length of hospital stay, with implications for both medical care and healthcare costs. No other significant differences were identified between the two fluid solutions. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Fluid boluses are the mainstay of treating children with signs of shock. The use of balanced fluids has not shown an advantage relating to morbidity or mortality. Most pediatric emergency departments use normal saline as a standard, while intensive care units shift to balanced solutions. WHAT IS NEW: * Using a balanced solution as the fluid of choice for boluses in a pediatric emergency department was feasible and showed a streamlined fluid treatment. The use of a balanced solution from emergency department presentation was associated with a shorter length of stay."
41326582,Integrated multi-omics of mitophagy-related molecular subtype characterization and biomarker identification in sepsis.,2025,"As a life-threatening condition driven by dysregulated host responses to infection, sepsis suffers from high mortality and heterogeneity. Mitophagy is the selective removal of damaged mitochondria, which is implicated in mitigating sepsis-related damage. The systematic identification and validation of key mitophagy-associated genes (MAG) for sepsis diagnosis, stratification, and immune modulation are lacking. Bulk transcriptomic datasets were integrated for differential expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning. We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data to map MAG expression, performed immune infiltration analyses by ESTIMATE, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and conducted consensus clustering based on MAG for molecular subtyping. As a screened MAG, the role of NUP93 was functionally validated in mitophagy using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with adenoviral overexpression. Integration of machine learning identified four MAG biomarkers (RPL18, PRPF8, NUP93, CUL1) with high diagnostic power (individual AUCs 0.957-0.975, nomogram AUC = 0.990). Consensus clustering based on these MAG stratified sepsis patients into distinct molecular subtypes with differing MAG expression, immune landscapes, and underlying immune-related pathways. NUP93 overexpression in vitro rescued LPS-induced mitophagy impairment by restoring mitochondrial PINK1 and LC3B levels. This study identifies RPL18, PRPF8, NUP93, and CUL1 as robust diagnostic MAG biomarkers for sepsis, demonstrates their utility in defining molecular subtypes with divergent immune microenvironments, and provides functional evidence that NUP93 promotes mitophagy during sepsis, offering novel tools for precision diagnosis and insights for targeted therapeutic strategies."
41325856,Age-specific predictive modelling of sepsis mortality: The diagnostic utility of CRP and serum creatinine.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of global mortality, with culture-negative cases posing major challenges to diagnosis and risk stratification. This study explores the utility of commonly used biomarkers in predicting sepsis-induced mortality and evaluates the performance of age-stratified binary logistic regression model. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted over one year, including 960 patients with suspected sepsis. Clinical parameters including procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), Total Leucocyte count (TLC), blood culture & other relevant variables related to sepsis were recorded. Binary logistic regression models were developed separately for each age group (new-born/infants, adults, older adults) to predict the sepsis-induced mortality. RESULTS: A statistically significant logistic regression model was achieved only in the new-born/infant group. CRP levels >/=100 mg/L emerged as a strong and independent predictor of mortality (AUC = 0.80, p = 0.02). Although serum creatinine demonstrated a significant association in univariate analysis, it did not retain significance in the multivariate model. PCT levels and blood culture positivity were not significant predictors of mortality in any age group. In adults and older adults, model performance was poor, showing a strong class imbalance and limited sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The strong predictive value of CRP in the new-born/infant group serves as a revalidation of its clinical utility in sepsis, particularly in the context of the poor performance of other commonly used biomarkers such as PCT and TLC. The results also highlight the importance of age-specific modelling and reinforce the need for a multi-marker approach in sepsis diagnostics."
41325727,Attenuation of a contemporary Chinese PRRSV-1 strain via serial cell passage and evaluation of its protective efficacy as a modified live virus vaccine candidate.,2026,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) imposes substantial economic burdens on global swine production. In China, where only subtype 1 strains circulate across 23 provinces, evolving subpopulations challenge existing control measures. The absence of licensed PRRSV-1 vaccines in China underscores the urgency of developing tailored vaccine candidates against circulating strains. This study attenuated a contemporary Chinese PRRSV-1 isolate (GXFS20220129) through 100 serial passages (P100) on MARC-145 cells and evaluated its efficacy as a modified live virus (MLV) candidate. In vitro characterization revealed enhanced growth kinetics and increased plaque morphology in P100. Whole-genome sequencing identified 37 nucleotide mutations and 19 amino acid substitutions in P100, concentrated in the nsp1-3 and GP2 regions, potentially associated with attenuation. Immunogenicity and protection were assessed in piglets. The P100-immunized group exhibited no clinical signs post-challenge, maintained weight gain equivalent to blank controls, and demonstrated robust seroconversion by 14 dpi. The area under the curve (AUC) analyses (28-42 dpi) showed significantly lower nasal-shedding and higher antibody responses in vaccinated pigs, whereas cumulative viremia and rectal-shedding AUCs were not significantly different between challenged groups. Vaccination attenuated viremia, accelerated viral clearance, significantly reduced viral loads in systemic tissues (heart, liver, lung, kidney) and intestinal segments (duodenum, ileum, rectum), and altered shedding kinetics. Gross and histopathological lesions in lungs and intestines were substantially mitigated in immunized animals. Collectively, serial passage generated an attenuated PRRSV-1 strain conferring comprehensive protection against homologous challenge, supporting its potential as an MLV candidate for PRRSV-1 control in China."
41325481,Association between the atherogenic index of plasma and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with sepsis: A retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a recognized marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between AIP and the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with sepsis has not yet been investigated. METHODS: The data used in this study were derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The clinical outcome was the occurrence of AKI. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between AIP and the risk of AKI in sepsis patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was applied to explore potential non-linear relationships. Threshold analysis confirmed a turning point at this value. Subgroup analyses evaluated the consistency of the association across different strata. Mediation analysis was performed to explore potential intermediate variables. RESULTS: Among 1,874 sepsis patients, higher AIP levels were associated with increased AKI incidence. Logistic regression showed a significant association between AIP and AKI in unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but the association was no longer significant after full adjustment. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship with a peak AKI risk at AIP = 1.333. Threshold analysis confirmed a turning point at this value. Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations, while nonlinear effects were more evident in specific groups. Mediation analysis suggested that SOFA score, creatinine, WBC count, and respiratory rate partially mediated the AIP-AKI relationship. CONCLUSION: AIP was nonlinearly associated with AKI in sepsis, with a clear threshold effect. This relationship was partially mediated by SOFA score, creatinine, WBC, and respiratory rate. AIP may serve as a useful marker for AKI risk assessment."
41325316,Hematocrit in the first 2 hours of life and short-term outcomes in very preterm infants: A secondary analysis from a prospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth, particularly very preterm birth (before 32 weeks of gestation), is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The early neonatal period is critical for preterm infants, with hematocrit levels serving as a important physiological indicator. We aimed to assess the relationship hematocrit in the first 2 hours of life and Short Outcomes in very preterm infants. METHODS: The research was a prospective cohort study completed by Dongli Song et al. We acquired data from the DATA DRYAD website and utilized exclusively for secondary analysis. From January 2008 to April 2014, data were gathered prospectively from eligible infants at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. The main outcomes included any Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH), any Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), and late-onset sepsis (LOS). Secondary outcomes were any intubation and any transfusion. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to calculate adjusted odd ratio (OR) with 95% CI. RESULTS: This study included 312 patients in total. Hematocrit in the first 2 hours of life, considered as a continuous variable, was significantly associated with short-term outcomes in univariate analyses (P < 0.05). After adjusting for GA, BW, and sex, only any ROP, any intubation, and any transfusion were statistically significant. With adjustments for multiple factors, the odds ratios for any ROP and any transfusion in infants whose Hematocrit was 45 or more in the first two hours of life, compared to those with an HCT less than 45 were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.19 ~ 0.97, p = 0.043) and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.12 ~ 0.7, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that higher HCT in the first 2 hours of life was statistically significant association with decreased ROP and blood transfusion in very preterm infants. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm and validate this association."
41324739,"Sepsis-associated immunosuppression: mechanistic Insights, Biomarkers, and therapeutic perspectives.",2025,"Sepsis is recognized as a major global health concern, characterized by a dysregulated and uncontrolled host response to infection that results in organ dysfunction and high mortality. Clinically, the course of sepsis typically begins with an intense hyperinflammatory phase, which is often followed by an immunosuppressive stage in many patients. This immunosuppressive state significantly increases susceptibility to secondary infections, complicates treatment, and worsens overall survival. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis-associated immune dysfunction involves profound alterations in immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. In addition, metabolic reprogramming through signaling pathways such as mTOR, AMPK, and PI3K-Akt contributes to the imbalance of immune responses and the deepening of immunosuppression. Currently, biomarkers such as HLA-DR expression are employed to monitor immune status and to predict clinical outcomes in septic patients. From a therapeutic perspective, the use of immunostimulatory agents, biomarker-guided monitoring, and personalized immunomodulatory strategies has gained increasing attention. Recent clinical and experimental findings suggest that these approaches may help restore immune competence and improve patient outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge regarding the cellular, molecular, and metabolic mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated immunosuppression and to discuss their potential implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."
41324692,Temporal robustness of biomarker-based classification algorithms for sepsis.,2026,"PURPOSE: Heterogeneity of the host response in sepsis hampers development of effective treatments. Several immunobiologically distinct subphenotypes (or endotypes) have been identified using data-driven analyses of single-timepoint biomarker data, but their temporal stability remains uncertain due to dynamic biology and statistical limitations. METHODS: We analyzed data from 345 sepsis patients across two ICU cohorts. 30 immune biomarkers were measured every 8 h for up to 7 days. Latent profile analysis was used to identify classes upon admission and re-classify patients at later timepoints. Temporal robustness was assessed by (1) inter-class transition rates, and (2) intra-class cohesion (regardless of label) using the Rand Index (RI). RESULTS: At ICU admission, three immune profiles were identified: profile A (149 patients, 43%) reflected adaptive immune activation (elevated IL-4, IL-5, RANTES, and GM-CSF); profile B (60 patients, 17%) a hyperinflammatory state (high IL-6, IL-8, IL-1Ra, and low protein C); and profile C (136 patients, 39%) broadly attenuated inflammation. By 48 h, the prevalences of A and B declined to 31% and 13%, while C increased to 56%. Inter-class transitions occurred most in patients assigned to A (41% of all 8-hourly transitions), compared to 39% and 22% for B and C. Intra-class cohesion across intervals was poor (median RI 65%, IQR 62-64%), indicating that patients classified together at admission did not remain consistently together. CONCLUSION: Sepsis patients were frequently reclassified across immune profiles over short intervals, with approximately one-third of subgroup peers changing at each timepoint. This instability challenges the clinical utility of biomarker-derived endotypes."
41324322,Identifying effective diagnostic biomarkers in sepsis by bioinformatics analysis.,2025,"Identifying appropriate biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and treatment holds great significance. This study aims to explore potential sepsis biomarkers through bioinformatics analysis. The expression profile data of sepsis were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Hub genes were screened and performed functional analysis, therewith verified using external datasets. The mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents were also identified. A total of 14 Hub genes were identified in this study including PRF1, CD247, IL7R, CD27, CCR7, IL2RB, GZMB, KLRK1, GZMK, CD160, FCGR1A, RUNX3, HLA-DRB1 and PRKCQ, which may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of sepsis."
41324108,Association of Long-Term Oral beta-Blocker Use With Cardiac Troponin I and B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Septic Myocardial Injury: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Septic myocardial injury, characterized by elevated levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is associated with increased mortality in sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate whether chronic oral beta-blocker use is associated with reduced cardiac biomarker levels and improved short-term outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 289 patients diagnosed with septic myocardial injury admitted to the ICU/EICU from January 2015 to June 2020. Patients were stratified into chronic beta-blocker users (n = 102) and non-users (n = 187). Associations between beta-blocker use and serum cTnI and BNP levels were analyzed using univariate and multivariate linear regression, adjusting for age, severity scores (SOFA, APACHE II), infection site, and vasopressor use. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and ICU length of stay. Subgroup analyses were performed by age and infection site. RESULTS: Chronic beta-blocker use was independently associated with significantly lower serum levels of cTnI (0.19 vs. 0.29 mug/L; beta = -0.07; 95% CI: -0.12 to -0.02; p < 0.001) and BNP (627 vs. 690 ng/L; beta = -36.6; 95% CI: -69.6 to -3.5; p = 0.03). However, no significant differences were observed in 28-day mortality or ICU length of stay. Subgroup analysis revealed greater biomarker reductions in patients under 60 years old and those with pulmonary infections, though sample sizes were limited. CONCLUSION: Long-term beta-blocker therapy is associated with lower levels of cardiac injury biomarkers in patients with septic myocardial injury. Subgroup analyses revealed greater reductions in younger patients and those with pulmonary infections, though these findings are exploratory. However, these biochemical improvements did not translate into short-term survival benefits. Prospective trials are needed to determine whether myocardial protection translates into clinical benefit."
41323700,Accelerated aptamer selection via SELEX and molecular simulations for lipopolysaccharide detection.,2025,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the major components of Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes, are critical virulence factors that can trigger severe immune responses, leading to sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. Rapid and accurate LPS detection is therefore essential in clinical diagnosis, pharmaceutical safety, and food monitoring. Aptamers represent a promising alternative to antibodies due to their high specificity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. However, the conventional SELEX process for aptamer selection is labor-intensive and time-consuming, often generating numerous candidates requiring costly experimental validation. Herein, we present a computationally assisted post-SELEX refinement pipeline that integrates molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to efficiently prioritize and validate aptamer candidates obtained from SELEX. Using LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 15380 as the model target, ten rounds of SELEX yielded candidate ssDNA sequences that were subsequently evaluated through our computational workflow. Among the refined candidates, aptamer seq. 5 exhibited the highest predicted and experimental affinity, with a dissociation constant (K (d)) of 6.68 nM, supported by both in vitro assays and molecular simulations. These finding demonstrate that the proposed SELEX-simulation pipeline significantly accelerates post-SELEX aptamer refinement, effectively reducing the number of candidates requiring expensive experimental screening and validation."
41323642,Multiple organ scoring systems for predicting in-hospital mortality of sepsis patients in the intensive care unit.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score, Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) in order to provide a more scientifically rigorous and effective tool for predicting mortality risk among sepsis patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: The demographic information and sepsis-related data were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database for patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. The predictive performance of CCI, LODS, APS III, SAPS II, and SOFA scoring systems in terms of ICU mortality was evaluated by comparing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Multivariate regression identified predictors, later validated with a nomogram. Finally, the dataset was divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3 to assess the clinical utility of the prediction model through ROC curves. RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 17,226 patients with a median age of 67.65 (55.79, 78.82) years; among them, males accounted for 57.69%. Within this cohort, a total of 1,115 (6.47%) individuals succumbed during their admission to the ICU. The ROC curve demonstrated that both APS III and LODS score exhibited robust predictive value for ICU mortality. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CCI, APS III score, LODS score, respiratory rate, body temperature, and race served as potential predictors. Combining these variables into a nomogram showed strong clinical utility, with AUCs of 0.803 (training set) and 0.797 (validation set). CONCLUSIONS: Organ failure scores hold significant clinical relevance in predicting mortality among sepsis patients in the ICU. Augmenting predictive accuracy can be achieved by integrating the CCI, APS III score, LODS score, mean respiratory rate, and body temperature during the initial 24 h following ICU admission."
41323595,Association between sepsis and all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality: a prospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between sepsis, including its subtypes, and all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality. METHODS: This population-based prospective cohort study included 371,558 participants from the UK Biobank recruited between 2006 and 2010. Sepsis was identified from hospital records using ICD-10 codes. Cox proportional-hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for premature mortality. RESULTS: Among 371,558 participants, 47,149 (12.7%) were diagnosed with sepsis, including 21,148 with implicit sepsis, 620 with explicit sepsis, and 25,381 with both. Sepsis was associated with a higher risk of all-cause premature mortality (aHR 2.36, 95% CI 2.26-2.46). Cause-specific analyses showed elevated risks for cardiovascular (aHR 2.35, 95% CI 2.18-2.54), respiratory (aHR 7.30, 95% CI 6.23-8.55), cancer-related (aHR 1.76, 95% CI 1.66-1.87), and infection-related premature mortality (aHR 9.75, 95% CI 6.97-13.62). Participants with explicit sepsis alone had elevated risk of all-cause mortality (aHR 1.72, 95% CI 1.21-2.45), which was lower than implicit sepsis alone (aHR 2.05, 95% CI 1.94-2.17) and highest for those with both implicit and explicit sepsis (aHR 2.60, 95% CI 2.48-2.73). Risks were more pronounced in participants with older age, multiple comorbidities, and unhealthy lifestyle (P (interaction) < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sepsis, especially implicit and combined implicit-explicit sepsis, was associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality. These associations were stronger in older participants, those with comorbidities, and unhealthy lifestyles."
41323570,Breast milk-acquired cytomegalovirus (aCMV) infection with sepsis-like syndrome in extremely preterm twins.,2025,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common perinatal viral infection. Most CMV infections are asymptomatic; only a part of them present with symptoms, particularly in infants fed fresh breast milk. This article reports a case of two extremely preterm twins who simultaneously developed severe breast milk-acquired CMV infection. By reviewing the medical records of two infants, observing their clinical symptoms, collecting laboratory test results (including blood routine, biochemistry, inflammatory indicators, etc.), and conducting continuous monitoring of CMV-DNA in blood, urine, and breast milk, the research results were obtained. Both infants presented with sepsis-like syndrome: fever, apnea, pneumonia with respiratory failure, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, but antibiotic treatment was ineffective. Finally, the diagnosis of breast milk-acquired CMV infection was confirmed by testing of CMV DNA. Severe breast milk-acquired CMV infection occurring simultaneously in preterm twins was extremely rare. In clinical practice, early detection, timely diagnosis, and positive intervention are key points for breast milk-acquired CMV infection."
41323250,Adapting a commercial sample extraction protocol for biosafety level 3/4 compatible plasma metabolomics analysis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Severe infections and sepsis significantly impact military operational readiness and costs through loss of duty days, high treatment rates, and medical evacuations. Early diagnosis is critical for preventing sepsis progression and mortality, but it requires validated biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making. Study protocols for host biomarker discovery in infections usually require inactivation of high-risk pathogens prior to sample analysis, which limits the utility of metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples. METHODS: Matched blood plasma aliquots obtained from an international, observational sepsis cohort were analyzed to quantify metabolites following the commercial AbsoluteIDQ p180 protocol, with and without the addition of an organic solvent extraction method for metabolites, proteins, and lipids (MPLEx), previously validated for inactivating BSL-3/4 pathogens. We evaluated analyte detection rates and concentrations for each method, as well as differences in extraction efficiency. RESULTS: Levels of agreement between the unmodified AbsoluteIDQ p180 and combined MPLEx-p180 methods varied by metabolite class. Most targeted amino acids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and monosaccharides were reliably measured and correlated well between methods. However, the higher sample dilution in the MPLEx-p180 method significantly reduced detection rates for biogenic amines and acylcarnitines, and overall extraction efficiencies also differed. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the applicability of commercial metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples by improving their suitability for high-risk infectious disease studies. Differences in metabolite extraction efficiencies and detection rates, as well as data harmonization strategies, should be considered if results from both protocols are to be combined."
41322976,Pathogen virulence and host response: A systematic review of severe illness in childhood musculoskeletal infection.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Severe forms of childhood bone and joint infection (BJI) involve multifocal sepsis, often requiring multiple surgeries and intensive care. Dysregulation of the Acute Phase Response (APR) occurs, as bacterial virulence factors disrupt protective inflammatory and coagulation mechanisms.(1,2) Many algorithms attempt to identify severe cases at diagnosis. Factors driving progression to life-threatening disease remain incompletely understood. This review summarizes risk associations for severe BJI in the context of host-pathogen interactions. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken from 01/01/2000-1/08/2025. Studies reporting host or pathogen factors associated with BJI severity for children </ = 18 years were included. Studies focussed on Kingella kingae or atypical organisms were excluded. C-reactive protein (CRP) trends in the context of severe illness were also examined. ROBINS-E was used to assess risk of bias. As it does not consider specific interventions and exposures, this review was not registered with PROSPERO. RESULTS: Literature search of electronic databases returned 1171 articles, of which 38 met full criteria. These comprised 10,084 patients across multiple continents. Pathogen factors associated with severe illness included Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), and individual bacterial virulence factors identified genomically. Notably, these virulence factors may be more important than methicillin resistance, with some MSSA strains causing equally severe disease. Very young children, specific ethnic groups, and those with congenital abnormalities were at higher risk. Early genetic studies propose variability in host inflammatory response genes. Sustained CRP elevation was a feature of worse disease, independent of pathogen subtype. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that severe pediatric BJI results from complex interactions between bacterial virulence factors and host response capacity. Awareness of these factors should equip clinicians to recognise potentially high-risk cases early in the course of illness. Future research should ascertain how virulence factors dysregulate the host APR, guiding therapeutic interventions targeting the underlying pathophysiology."
41322865,A Rare Case of Ovarian Dermoid Torsion in the Third Trimester: Clinical Challenges and Surgical Management.,2025,"Adnexal torsion is an uncommon but serious complication of pregnancy, particularly rare in the third trimester, where it poses challenges for both diagnosis and management. We report the case of a 25-year-old primigravida at 36+3 weeks of gestation with a known right ovarian dermoid cyst who presented with acute abdominal and back pain. She had experienced multiple previous admissions for abdominal pain that were managed conservatively. Initial investigations, including ultrasound and MRI, confirmed the presence of an 8 cm complex right ovarian mass but did not conclusively demonstrate torsion. Despite conservative management and antibiotic therapy for suspected sepsis, her pain worsened, and laboratory results showed raised inflammatory markers. Owing to persistent symptoms and clinical deterioration, an emergency caesarean section with concurrent surgical management was undertaken. Intra-operatively, the right ovary was found to be twisted four times, and a cystectomy with partial oophorectomy was performed along with delivery of a healthy female infant. Postoperative recovery was favourable, and histopathology confirmed a dermoid cyst. This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainty of adnexal torsion in pregnancy, where overlapping symptoms can obscure recognition. It underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion, early multidisciplinary involvement, and timely surgical intervention to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes."
41322835,Prostatic Abscess in a 45-Year-Old Male: Atypical Presentation and Successful Management With Open Transperineal Drainage.,2025,"A prostatic abscess is a rare but serious urological emergency that requires prompt recognition and intervention due to associated risks of urosepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. This case describes a previously healthy 45-year-old male who experienced delayed diagnosis and management of a complex prostatic abscess following multiple encounters with secondary care services. Imaging revealed a prostatic abscess with atypical features, including multiloculation and extension into the ischiorectal fossa and gluteal region. Given the extensive nature of the infection and preoperative signs of sepsis, emergency drainage was performed through an unconventional transperineal open approach in a joint procedure between Urology and General Surgery. This method was selected because aspiration alone, although considered the first-line approach for prostatic abscess drainage, was unlikely to provide adequate drainage given the multiloculated and extensive nature of the abscess. As no underlying cause for abscess formation was identified during inpatient admission, the patient underwent a comprehensive outpatient evaluation following acute management. This follow-up included detailed biochemical and clinical assessments, coupled with thorough history-taking, to identify any missed risk factors. This case underscores several key considerations for clinical practice, including the importance of early imaging to guide management, guideline-directed antibiotic therapies, robust follow-up and safety-netting systems, and timely multidisciplinary collaboration. It also demonstrates that an open transperineal drainage approach serves as a safe and effective treatment for atypical abscesses when conventional transurethral, transrectal, or minimally invasive transperineal methods are likely to be inadequate."
41322368,Management of Acute Urinary Retention due to Bladder Outlet Obstruction in the Setting of Incarcerated Gravid Uterus.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: An incarcerated gravid uterus (IGU) is a rare condition that occurs when a retroverted gravid uterus becomes trapped between the sacral promontory and pubic symphysis. If untreated, IGU could have devastating consequences including uremia, renal failure, sepsis, peritonitis, uterine wall necrosis/rupture, and ultimately maternal and/or fetal death. Our objective is to provide education on the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a rare diagnosis to assist clinicians in better recognizing and treating IGU. METHODS: We present two cases of gravid females with acute urinary retention (AUR) in the setting of IGU. In this case series, we will discuss patient presentation, workup, and management of both IGU and AUR secondary to IGU. RESULTS: The first patient represents delayed recognition of IGU and a protracted clinical course resulting in increased morbidity. The second case represents heightened recognition of IGU and appropriate, timely management. CONCLUSION: Prompt bladder decompression by urethral or suprapubic catheterization is the mainstay treatment for nearly all etiologies of AUR. In the case of AUR due to IGU, it is imperative to address bladder decompression prior to the reduction of IGU."
41322235,Clinical features analysis for complications in infants with late-onset Group B streptococcal sepsis: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors associated with complications in infants with late-onset Group B Streptococcal (GBS) sepsis, and to provide evidence for clinical intervention strategies. METHODS: This study is a retrospective case-control study. The clinical data of 101 infants with late-onset GBS sepsis, diagnosed before 3 months of age were retrospectively analyzed. According to the presence or absence of complications, the infants were divided into the complication group and the non-complication group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the risk factors associated with the occurrence of complications in infants with late-onset GBS sepsis. Using ROC curves to evaluate the predictive efficacy of clinical variables. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases of late-onset GBS sepsis met the inclusion criteria, including 41 in the non-complication group and 60 in the complication group. The gestational age in the complication group was significantly lower than that in the non-complication group (P < 0.05). Clinically, the complication group had a higher incidence of seizure, bulging anterior fontanelle, and fever, as well as a significantly lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P < 0.05). Laboratory findings showed that the complication group had a higher incidence of hypoalbuminemia, concomitant positivity in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and significantly lower pH and albumin levels (P < 0.05). In addition, the complication group exhibited significantly higher Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) scores, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score 2 (PELOD-2) scores, and higher proportion of patients with high pSOFA (>3.50) and PELOD-2 scores (>3.50) (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that high PELOD-2 score, high pSOFA score, high creatinine levels and hypoalbuminemia were risk factors for the development of complications in infants with late-onset GBS sepsis; the ROC curve constructed using these predictors demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.782-0.934), sensitivity of 77.78%, and specificity of 82.61%. CONCLUSION: High PELOD-2 score, high pSOFA score, high creatinine levels, and hypoalbuminemia independently predict complications in late-onset GBS sepsis infants, enabling early risk stratification and tailored treatment to improve outcomes."
41322187,Giant Pyonephrosis Diagnosed Using POCUS in a Resource-Limited Setting.,2025,"Pyonephrosis is a severe complication of hydronephrosis and can lead to the destruction of the renal parenchyma, sepsis, shock, and death. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, and 15% of patients are asymptomatic on presentation. In resource-limited settings, where Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is not available, point of care ultrasound (POCUS) plays an important role in evaluating kidney diseases in the emergency department (ED). In this case, a 36-year-old man presented to the ED with dyspnea, fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention in the area where an intra-abdominal tumor was reported. After ultrasound-guided aspiration, pyonephrosis was diagnosed. In the absence of other capable specialists, the emergency physician performed a percutaneous nephrostomy procedure, and eight liters of pus were removed. The patient improved significantly and was discharged from the ED with oral antibiotics and scheduled urology follow-up in the clinic."
41321934,PD-L1 and the risk of bacterial infection in patients with chronic liver diseases: An international multicohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Impaired phagocytic capacity due to activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has been implicated in the development of bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) is easily measurable in plasma and has been proposed as a biomarker of sepsis. In the current study, we aim to evaluate the role of sPD-L1 as a biomarker of bacterial infection development in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Plasma samples from 995 patients with chronic liver disease grouped in three cohorts were analyzed: an initial cohort of 268 hospitalized patients with acute decompensated cirrhosis, 327 out-patients with non-acute decompensated cirrhosis and finally 400 patients with high-risk alcohol consumption, including all stages of liver fibrosis, from mild/no fibrosis to cirrhosis (F0-F4). The main outcomes of the study were development of bacterial infection and mortality. RESULTS: Patients who developed bacterial infections had higher median levels of sPD-L1 than those who did not (160 [IQR 116-221] vs. 136 [IQR 97-193] pg/ml, respectively, p value <0.001; hazard ratio 1.034, 95% CI 1.014-1.055). Levels of sPD-L1 were associated with bacterial infection development after adjustment for confounding factors. During follow-up, patients who died had higher median sPD-L1 levels than survivors, after adjustment for MELD Na (180 [IQR 143-267] vs. 134 [IQR 97-187] pg/ml, respectively; p value <0.001; HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043-1.089). These findings were observed in all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of sPD-L1 are associated with the risk of bacterial infection development irrespective of the stage of chronic liver disease. Furthermore, higher sPD-L1 levels are linked to increased mortality. Measurement of sPD-L1 levels may help identify patients at high risk of developing bacterial infections and guide the implementation of new preventive strategies. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study explores the role of soluble PD-L1 as a biomarker of immune dysfunction and its association with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. Our findings demonstrate that soluble PD-L1 levels increase with the progression of liver disease and they are independently associated with an increased risk of bacterial infection development and mortality. These results could help physicians identify high-risk individuals earlier and implement preventive strategies."
41321670,Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Exposure and One-Year Mortality Risk After Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery: A Multi-Institutional Study.,2025,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between perioperative dexmedetomidine exposure and one-year mortality risk following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network. Adult patients aged >/=18 years who underwent elective VATS between January 2010 and December 2024 were included in the study. Patients were categorized into dexmedetomidine or midazolam (control) groups based on perioperative medication exposure. Midazolam was selected as the active comparator as it represents a standard perioperative sedative with different pharmacological properties than dexmedetomidine. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed using demographic variables, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within one year; and the secondary outcome was overall major complications (composite of sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and acute kidney failure). RESULTS: After propensity matching, 6387 patients were included in each group with balanced baseline characteristics. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine had significantly lower one-year mortality compared to midazolam (4.1% vs 5.4%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.94; p=0.007). This mortality difference was observed during the later follow-up period (31-365 days: HR:0.80; p=0.008) rather than the early postoperative period (1-30 days: HR:0.89; p=0.695). No difference was observed in overall major complications between groups (12.7% each; HR 1.05; p=0.289). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Perioperative dexmedetomidine administration is associated with reduced one-year mortality following VATS compared to midazolam. The mortality benefit appears during the later follow-up period without differences in major complication rates. Future prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine optimal dosing strategies."
41321462,"Comparison of organ dysfunction patterns in pediatric hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and sepsis: incidence, adverse outcomes, and cluster characteristics.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and severe sepsis share similarities in their clinical manifestations, and both have high risks of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The aim of this study was to investigate the similarities and differences in organ dysfunction patterns among pediatric patients with HLH and severe sepsis. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with either HLH or severe sepsis from a tertiary children's hospital over a 5-year period were included. Eleven complications representing organ dysfunction in major systems (hepatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hematologic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal) were examined. The primary outcome was adverse outcome, defined as in-hospital death or discharge following withdrawal of advanced life-sustaining treatment. The incidence and adverse outcome rates of organ dysfunction among pediatric patients with HLH and severe sepsis were compared, along with the cumulated number of complications and the correlation networks of complications, as well as laboratory characteristics. RESULTS: This study included 231 pediatric patients with HLH and 259 with severe sepsis. Adverse outcomes occurred in 15.2% of HLH patients and 18.9% of severe sepsis patients. In HLH, the most prevalent complications were hepatic injury (46.8%) and coagulopathy (43.3%), while adverse outcome rates were highest among patients who developed ARDS (81.8%) and heart failure (77.8%). In severe sepsis, the leading complications were shock (69.9%), respiratory failure (52.1%), and coagulopathy (51.0%); adverse outcome rates were highest among patients with heart failure (67.5%), hepatic failure (61.9%), and ARDS (50%). For most complications investigated, HLH showed lower incidences compared to severe sepsis, but with similar or higher adverse outcome rates. Under the same number of complications, HLH had a higher adverse outcome rates than severe sepsis. However, patients with severe sepsis tended to develop more complications (median 3 vs. 2, P < 0.0001), resulting in similar overall adverse outcome rates for these two conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, adverse outcome rates, and clustering patterns of organ dysfunction differed between HLH and severe sepsis. Strategies to improve prognosis should vary for each condition. In HLH, preventing the development of severe organ dysfunction is crucial, whereas in severe sepsis, the emphasis should be on preventing the clustering of multiple complications."
41321458,Case Report: Conservative management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with fulminant hepatic failure in a pediatric leukemia patient.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that can lead to multiorgan failure, including acute liver failure. While varicella infection in leukemia patients in remission is not uncommon, HLH complicated by fulminant hepatic failure is exceedingly rare. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an adolescent with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia in remission who developed varicella infection, followed by decompensated shock and acute liver failure (ALF). The patient met HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, including fever, pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and bone marrow hemophagocytosis. The patient received immunosuppressive therapy according to the HLH-2004 protocol, along with antiviral therapy and supportive care, and achieved full recovery without liver transplantation. To our knowledge, this is among the few reported cases of HLH-associated acute liver failure in a pediatric leukemia patient successfully managed conservatively. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of HLH in immunocompromised children, where early signs such as fever and cytopenias may be misattributed to sepsis or chemotherapy-related complications. It underscores the importance of including HLH in the differential diagnosis of ALF in high-risk patients and demonstrates that prompt recognition and targeted treatment of the hyperinflammatory state can be lifesaving, even in severe presentations."
41321456,Analysis of adverse reactions and cost-driving factors during the induction phase of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy and incurs high medical costs due to the complexity and duration of treatment. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of adverse reactions during the induction phase of ALL treatment and identify key factors influencing hospitalization costs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 292 newly diagnosed cases of ALL in children who received induction therapy at Hebei Children's Hospital (2020-2024) under the CCLG-ALL-2018 protocol. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and hospitalization cost data were collected. Adverse reactions were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Hospitalization costs were analyzed using the structural variation method and grey relational analysis. Multivariate linear regression was performed to identify cost-related factors. RESULTS: The median patient age was 4.9 years (male:female = 6:4). Most cases were B-cell ALL (88.36%), and 69.52% were classified as intermediate risk. Adverse reaction rates were relatively low, including allergic reactions (2.74%), pancreatic toxicity (3.77%), and hepatotoxicity (13.36%). Infections were common, with sepsis occurring in 49.32% and pneumonia in 32.19% of cases. The mean hospitalization costs during the induction phase decreased from 77,690 RMB in 2020 to 56,263 RMB in 2024. Diagnostic fees (37.55%) and medication (30.52%) represented the largest cost components. Hospitalization days, intravenous antifungal medication, tumor lysis syndrome, blood product usage, severe pneumonia infection, surgery performed and discharge yearwere determined to be independent predictors of increased costs. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse reactions and complications markedly burden induction treatment. Optimizing protocols, improving monitoring, and implementing cost-control measures can enhance outcomes and reduce costs. Larger sample sizes and socioeconomic variables should be included in future research."
41320998,Nomogram Prediction Model for Risk Factors of Secondary Infection in Sepsis Patients.,2025,"ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with secondary infection in patients diagnosed with sepsis.MethodsClinical data of patients diagnosed with sepsis on the first day of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV version 2.0 database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to analyze the influencing factors. A nomogram for predicting the risk of secondary infection was constructed using R software.ResultsA total of 2247 patients met the eligibility criteria for this study. Lower oxygen saturation, reduced lymphocyte proportion, decreased platelet count, higher neutrophil proportion, elevated lactic acid levels within 24 h after ICU admission, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation were identified as independent risk factors for secondary infection in sepsis patients during their ICU stay. These predictors were integrated into a nomogram to estimate the risk of secondary infection in sepsis patients, and R software was employed to construct this Nomogram.ConclusionsThe Nomogram, incorporating oxygen saturation, lymphocyte ratio, platelet count, neutrophil ratio, lactic acid levels, and mechanical ventilation, can provide individualized risk predictions for secondary infection in patients with sepsis."
41320321,Disseminated Histoplasmosis and Campylobacter jejuni Bacteremia Coinfection Revealing Autosomal Dominant NFKB1 Deficiency-Related Common Variable Immunodeficiency.,2025,"This report presents the case of a Thai male in his twenties presenting prolonged fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Blood cultures isolated Campylobacter jejuni, while lymph node cultures isolated Histoplasma capsulatum. A gene panel for immunodeficiency revealed nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) deficiency, leading to a final diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) due to autosomal dominant NFKB1 deficiency. The patient was initially treated with amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks, followed by itraconazole 200 mg orally twice daily, and received intravenous azithromycin 500 mg once daily for C. jejuni bacteremia for 14 days. After three months of treatment, the patient demonstrated partial clinical and radiologic improvement. Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to treat CVID. After 12 months of itraconazole, the follow-up computed tomography showed reduced lymphadenopathy to subcentimetric nodes and resolved hepatomegaly. Patients with disseminated atypical infections should be evaluated for primary immunodeficiency disorders, even when considered healthy."
41320315,Species Distribution and Antifungal Susceptibility of Fungal Blood Isolates over a 16-Year Period at a University Hospital.,2025,"This study aimed to investigate the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of fungal blood isolates collected at a university hospital between 2008 and 2023. A total of 395 fungal isolates were identified, with Candida albicans being the most prevalent species (46.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (23.5%), Candida glabrata (13.7%), and Candida tropicalis (6.3%). Antifungal susceptibility to three azoles and micafungin was assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, M27-A3 (2008) and M27M44S ED3 (2022). Susceptibility categorization was defined as susceptible (S) or susceptible-dose-dependent (SDD). The findings revealed high susceptibility rates for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole under the 2008 criteria (S + SDD = 89.5%-100%). In contrast, according to the 2022 criteria, C. albicans and C. parapsilosis exhibited 100% susceptibilities to fluconazole and voriconazole, whereas C. glabrata was only susceptible to fluconazole at the SDD (97.4%). Susceptibility of C. tropicalis to the tested azoles was notably lower, with rates of S + SDD = 52.4% under the 2008 criteria and S + SDD = 47.3% and 52.4% for fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively, under the 2022 criteria. Susceptibility to micafungin was high in all four common Candida species, with rates of S >/= 97.4% under the 2008 criteria and S >/= 94.7% under the 2022 criteria. These results indicate that antifungal susceptibility among fungal blood isolates has remained stable, except decreasing susceptibility of C. tropicalis to azoles. Continuous surveillance is essential to inform the optimization of treatment strategies for invasive fungal infections."
41319866,"Outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia bacteremia consequent to contaminated ultrasound gel-a report from a tertiary care centre in South Tamilnadu, India.",2026,"We report an outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia bacteremia in a cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit. Four cases of bloodstream infections were reported between August 16, 2024 and August 31, 2024. Microbiological surveillance of clean and sterile material from the unit revealed growth of B. cepacia from opened and sealed ultrasound gel bottles. Further cultures acquired from ultrasound gel containers from other units also grew B. cepacia and hence displaced by single use sterile gel. The outbreak was regarded terminated by the first week of September 2024 as no additional cases were described."
41319356,Hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction as a predictor of mortality in intensive care unit patients with septic shock.,2025,"BACKGROUND: A hyperdynamic left ventricle (ejection fraction (EF) >/=70 %) on stress imaging is closely linked to diastolic dysfunction and may indicate heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) in the right clinical context. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the underlying causes and prognostic implications of hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction (HDLVEF) in critically ill patients diagnosed with sepsis. METHODS: A total of 235 patients diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to the intensive care unit were included in this study. Diagnosis of sepsis was established based on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, which was calculated upon admission and updated every 24 h using the worst values from the prior day. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed either by the principal investigator or a certified cardiologist accredited by the Egyptian Medical Society of Echocardiography (EMSE). RESULTS: Among the 235 patients, 88 (37.4 %) died within 28 days, while 147 (62.6 %) survived. Hyperdynamic EF was significantly more prevalent in the deceased group compared to survivors, with an odds ratio of 4.822 (95 % CI: 1.467-8.852), indicating a strong association with mortality. Multivariate analysis identified several independent predictors of mortality, including older age, lower mean arterial pressure, higher SOFA scores, and elevated serum lactate levels. Additionally, the mortality rate was significantly higher among male patients. CONCLUSION: HDLVEF holds significant prognostic value in patients with sepsis in critical care. It may serve as a valuable early echocardiographic marker of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy or cardiovascular dysfunction, potentially aiding in risk assessment and early therapeutic decisions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered before patient enrolment at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID/ NCT06993948)."
41319124,Ventilator-induced brain injury: another iatrogenic complication of mechanical ventilation.,2026,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mechanical ventilation is life-saving, but is increasingly recognized to be involved in adverse neurological outcomes. Ventilator-associated brain injury (VABI) refers to primary brain dysfunction directly attributable to mechanical ventilation, independent of sedation, hypoxemia, or sepsis. This review summarizes current evidence on the pathophysiology, clinical impact, monitoring strategies, and potential therapeutic interventions for VABI. RECENT FINDINGS: A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies suggest that mechanical ventilation contributes to hippocampal apoptosis, maladaptive vagal and purinergic signaling, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, altered CO 2 regulation, and nasal airflow abolition. Clinically, VABI may manifest as delirium, disordered sleep, prolonged weaning, and long-term cognitive impairment. Monitoring tools such as electroencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, cerebral biomarkers, Doppler ultrasound, and MRI offer complementary but indirect insights. As of today, preventive and therapeutic strategies focus on lung-protective ventilation, limited sedation, early mobilization, and good quality sleep promotion. Some innovative approaches such restoration of nasal airflow, phrenic and vagal stimulation remain experimental. SUMMARY: VABI is increasingly recognized as a critical research frontier in critical care medicine. Awareness of its mechanisms and clinical impact should prompt ICU clinicians to integrate brain-oriented practices into routine care. Future trials are needed to evaluate preventive strategies and improve long-term cognitive and functional outcomes for ICU survivors."
41318782,Impact of sex on outcomes in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone.,2025,"Limited evidence exists regarding the influence of sex on the prognosis of patients with persistent septic shock following hydrocortisone treatment. This study aimed to examine sex-related differences in hydrocortisone treatment outcomes among critically ill patients with persistent septic shock. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted over 12 months, including critically ill adult patients who were admitted with persistent septic shock and were on vasopressors while receiving hydrocortisone. The primary outcome was twenty-eight-day mortality. The secondary outcomes included vasopressor support duration, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement, mechanical ventilation (MV) requirement, and seven-day mortality. In total, 621 patients were analyzed; of these, 59.3% were male. Male sex was linked to an elevated 28-day mortality risk according to univariate analysis (OR 1.543, 95% CI 1.112-2.141; p = 0.009) and multivariate adjustment (OR 1.604, 95% CI 1.142-2.253; p = 0.006). According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, a significant difference in 28-day mortality (p = 0.008) was observed, with females exhibiting consistently higher cumulative survival rates. The initial analysis of secondary outcomes showed no differences, except for the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT); however, this association did not remain significant in multivariate analysis. This study underscores significant sex differences in the outcomes of patients with persistent septic shock treated with hydrocortisone, with males exhibiting higher 28-day mortality than females. In all measured secondary outcomes, no significant differences were detected.Trial registration: This investigation was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06537180, study ID: GBD-HYDRO, 31 July 2024)."
41318616,"Changing epidemiology, prescription and outcomes of acute kidney injury patients treated by peritoneal dialysis during 20 years: a cohort study.",2025,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) for AKI patients using a flexible catheter and cycler was started in 2004 in Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study aimed to describe the main determinants of patient and technique survival, including PD treatment trends in AKI patients over time. This was a large Brazilian retrospective cohort study in which adult AKI patients with PD were studied from January/2004 to January/2024. For comparison purposes, patients were divided into two groups according to the year of treatment: 2004-2014 and 2015-2024. We included 487 patients. The mean age was 64.02 +/- 15.01 years and 327 (67.1%) patients were male. Most patients needed vasoactive drugs and mechanical ventilation (66.1% and 73.1%, respectively). The mean ATN-index specific score (ISS) was 0.61 +/- 0.2, and the median APACHE-II score was 27 (20-31). Sepsis was the primary diagnosis (33.7%), followed by cardiovascular etiologies (29.2%). Uremia or azotemia was the main indication for dialysis (46.4%). The delivered urea Kt/V was 0.55 +/- 0.18/session and 3.22 +/- 0.6/week. Over the years, the prevalence of catabolism increased from 7.6 to 26.5% (p < 0.0001), and PD has been used more in patients with liver cirrhosis (from 5.3 to 14.1%, p < 0.0001) and with nephrotoxic AKI (from 0 to 5.9%, p < 0.0001), and less in septic patients (40.1 vs. 23.2%). The groups were similar in terms of APACHE2. The indication for dialysis due to azotemia/uremia decreased from 64.9% to 16.2% (p < 0.0001) and increased by metabolic and fluid demand to capacity imbalance (from 4 to 68.1%, p < 0.0001). The prescribed dialysis PD dose decreased from 0.56 +/- 0.09 to 0.44 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.001), and there was no difference in metabolic and volume control. There was an increase in kidney function recovery from 24.8 to 35.7% (p < 0.0001) and a reduction in mortality over 30 days from 59.9% to 49.2% (p 0.02) and in technical failure (TF) from 15.6% to 5.9% (p < 0.0001). The main cause of TF was mechanical complication followed by peritonitis. Cox regression identified the period 2004-2014 as a risk factor for death and technique failure (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.16-4.93, p = 0.018, and OR 12.58, 95%CI 2.74-57.69, p = 0.001, respectively). In the second period, PD was indicated earlier and prescribed at a lower dose, with no difference in the patient's metabolic and volume control. There was an improvement in patient survival and technique over the years, suggesting better indication and management of this therapy. This is the largest cohort in the world to provide patient characteristics, clinical practice, and its relationship with clinical outcomes."
41318541,The PIK3C3/MAPK14 axis drives M1 polarization via autophagy Inhibition to exacerbate Sepsis-Induced acute lung injury.,2025,"Dysregulation of macrophage autophagy plays a critical role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI); however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the regulatory pathway involving the PIK3C3-MAPK14 signaling axis that drives ALI progression by controlling autophagy and macrophage polarization. Using machine learning transcriptomic analysis, MAPK14 was identified as a core gene associated with ALI, and multi-omics integration confirmed its upregulated expression in ALI tissues. MAPK14 localization to pro-inflammatory macrophages was determined using single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, we observed a significant positive correlation between MAPK14 and autophagy-related genes. Molecular docking and kinetic simulations revealed high-affinity interactions between PIK3C3 and MAPK14 (DeltaG-bind = -127.722 +/- 33.269 kJ/mol). In vitro experiments followed by Western Blot(WB) and RT-q polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide stimulation upregulated MAPK14 expression through downregulation of PIK3C3 expression, resulting in impaired autophagic flux (LC3-II/Ⅰ downward arrow, TOM20 upward arrow, P62 upward arrow, HSP60 upward arrow). Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed a shift toward pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization. RNA pull-down assay directly captured the PIK3C3-MAPK14 complex, and functional validation showed that PIK3C3 overexpression significantly inhibited MAPK14 protein expression, whereas PIK3C3 knockdown enhanced it. In conclusion, targeting the PIK3C3-MAPK14 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for ALI."
41318474,"Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection at a referral children's hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, 2018-2022.",2025,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a vaccine, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Studies describing S. aureus bloodstream infection (BSI) in children in Africa remain few. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH) in Cape Town, South Africa. All S. aureus positive blood culture results for the period 2018-2022 on the National Health Laboratory Service microbiology database were identified. Case records of participants with S. aureus positive blood cultures were retrieved. Demographic, clinical, antimicrobial management and participant outcome data were extracted from the case records. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges as appropriate. Parametric (Student t-test) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent variables) methods were used to compare continuous variables. Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. RStudio statistical computing software version 4.4.2 was used for the logistic regression analysis. Our findings were also compared with a similar study at our institution which analysed the epidemiology of Staphylococcus bloodstream infections between 2007 and 2011 (Naidoo et al. PLoS ONE 8(10):e78396, 2013). RESULTS: During the 5-year study period there were 245 S. aureus BSIs identified, with an overall annual incidence risk of 2.7 cases per 1000 admissions. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) caused 10% of the BSIs and was predominantly healthcare-associated (79.2%). Only 2.1% of participants were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, underweight was present in 29.2% of children with S. aureus BSI. Healthcare-associated infection comprised 33.3% of all S. aureus BSIs. 70% of BSIs had an identifiable site of infection with skin and soft tissue (25%) being the commonest. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to linezolid, teicoplanin, tigecycline and vancomycin. The mortality rate within 28 days of S. aureus BSI diagnosis was 8.3%. The commonest attributable cause of death was septic shock (25%). Requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission during a BSI, (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR): 5.4, 95% CI: 1.89-15.21) was associated with increased 28-day mortality rate. When compared to the 2007-2011 study, there has been a decline in the incidence risk of S. aureus BSI and the prevalence of healthcare-associated MRSA BSI. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus BSI remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Admission to ICU during a BSI episode was significantly associated with 28-day mortality. Furthermore, over time changes to the epidemiology of S. aureus BSI have occurred at RCWMCH. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable (study is not a clinical trial)."
41317596,Identifying Predictive Biomarkers for Sepsis in Trauma-Induced Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Using Proteomics Data.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in surveillance, protocolized resuscitation, and critical care organ support, sepsis remains a common and fatal complication in trauma. Trauma-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can mask the occurrence of sepsis, complicating the diagnosis of sepsis. Thus, it is significant to identify high-risk patients of sepsis among trauma-induced SIRS for early prevention, early diagnosis, and early intervention of sepsis. This study seeks to identify predictive biomarkers for sepsis in patients with trauma-induced SIRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The existing plasma proteomics data from 62 severe trauma patients with (38 cases) and without (24 cases) SIRS were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 38 patients with SIRS, 15 SIRS patients who subsequently developed sepsis (SDS) were assigned to SDS group, while the remaining 23 SIRS patients who did not develop sepsis (SDDS) constituted SDDS group. By comparing the SDS and SDDS groups, predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS were identified. RESULTS: Fifteen differentially expressed proteins were identified between SDS and SDDS groups. We screened top 5 differentially expressed proteins as predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS, including ANXA6 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.881), FA12 (AUC = 0.873), TRY2 (AUC = 0.868), FIBG (AUC = 0.759), and DOPD (AUC = 0.745). The combined predictive performance of these biomarkers is better (AUC = 0.9913). To balance robust predictive performance with a minimal panel size, we developed a panel consisting of ANXA6 and FIBG, which demonstrated superior predictive performance (AUC = 0.9652). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS. Notably, integrating coagulation and inflammatory markers enabled substantial reduction in the number of required modeling indicators while preserving superior diagnostic performance. These findings offer new insights into developing early predictive panels."
41316478,The impact of early nutritional support on in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis caused by bacterial or viral infections: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The impact of pathogen type on the relationship between early nutritional support and prognosis in sepsis patients remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of early nutritional support on in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis caused by viral or bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, between 2016 and 2023. Early nutritional support was defined as initiating nutritional support within 48 h of sepsis diagnosis. Patients were stratified based on pathogen type, and propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability weighting (IPW) were used to adjust for confounding factors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of early nutritional support on in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2,278 patients with sepsis were included (119 viral and 2,159 bacterial). After adjustment, in the viral sepsis group, early nutritional support was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality compared to delayed support (25.0% vs. 30.0%, aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99, p = 0.046). In contrast, in the bacterial sepsis group, early nutritional support showed no significant benefit for in-hospital mortality (16.3% vs. 18.5%, aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.06, p = 0.328). For bacterial sepsis, early support was associated with longer ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors. CONCLUSION: Early nutritional support may offer a potential survival benefit in patients with viral sepsis. Given the small size and borderline statistical significance, these findings should be interpreted with caution and require further validation through prospective randomized controlled trials."
41316420,Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in critical illness: etiology-driven management and the role of bedside transthoracic echocardiography.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is an increasingly recognized life-threatening condition in critically ill patients, with ICU mortality rates reaching 53% in septic shock populations. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has become indispensable for early detection due to its diagnostic sensitivity and real-time monitoring capabilities in ICU settings. CASES: We present three prototypical cases managed at our tertiary center: (1) A 66-year-old male with volume depletion-induced LVOTO (peak gradient 29 mmHg) reversed by fluid resuscitation; (2) A 71-year-old female developing inotrope-induced obstruction (36 mmHg gradient) requiring beta-blockade; and (3) A septic shock patient with severe LVOTO managed through combined fluid resuscitation, sedation, and vasopressor optimization. MANAGEMENT: Pathophysiology-guided interventions included: fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia (Case 1), analgesia/sedation for hypercontractility (Case 2), and norepinephrine for preload and afterload augmentation in sepsis (Case 3). Serial TTE monitoring confirmed gradient reductions. OUTCOMES: Early TTE-directed therapy achieved: (1) vasopressor weaning in 48 h (Case 1), (2) hemodynamic stabilization within 24 h (Case 2), and (3) septic shock reversal (Case 3). CONCLUSION: LVOTO is a life-threatening yet underrecognized complication in critical care, requiring prompt and tailored management based on its diverse etiologies. Bedside TTE serves as an essential tool for rapid diagnosis, guiding targeted interventions, and optimizing outcomes in these high-risk patients. It should be stressed that almost all hypotensive patients in contemporary ICUs should receive bedside TTE as a standard of care, given its critical role in identifying underlying causes and informing timely treatment decisions."
41316382,Invasive Group A Streptococcus infections in children during the post-pandemic period: results from a multicenter study in Italy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus causes pediatric infections from mild to severe forms. Since late 2022, invasive cases have increased in Europe, possibly due to reduced post-COVID-19 immunity, more respiratory virus circulation, and emergence of virulent strains. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter observational study was conducted in twelve Italian pediatric Hospitals, including patients under 18 years hospitalized with invasive or severe Group A Streptococcus infection. Data were anonymized and analyzed to identify factors associated with Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission and discharge with sequelae or death. RESULTS: Seventy-five children with invasive or severe Group A Streptococcus infection were included; the majority (69.3%) were aged 2-10 years. Invasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infection accounted for 58.7% (n = 44) and severe GAS (sGAS) infection for 41.3% (n = 31) of cases. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admission was required in 45.3% (n = 34) of the entire patient cohort, in this subgroup viral coinfection (OR 5.684, p = 0.003), sepsis/septic shock (OR 4.406, p = 0.003), iGAS diagnosis (OR 4.153, p = 0.005), and procalcitonin (PCT) > 0.5 ng/mL (OR 7.105, p = 0.019) were independently associated with admission; the use of corticosteroids (OR 4.641, p = 0.003) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (OR 16.667, p = 0.003) was also significantly more frequent. All patients received empirical beta-lactam antibiotics; anti-toxin therapy was administered in 47 patients (62.7%): clindamycin (49.3%), linezolid (16.0%), and rifampicin (1.3%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 24.0% (n = 18), and 49.3% (n = 37) underwent surgery. Post-infectious sequelae occurred in 20.0% (n = 15) and four children died, mostly due to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. CONCLUSION: Pediatric invasive group A streptococcal infection continues to pose a significant clinical challenge, with notable rates of morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for early recognition and close monitoring of high-risk patients. A widespread use of adjunctive therapies was documented. Continued surveillance and robust clinical research are essential to optimize management strategies and improve patient outcomes."
41316366,Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic duration for hospitalized patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic duration for critically ill adults with sepsis may be clinically effective and safe. However, cost-effectiveness analyses using clinical trial data for this precision medicine approach in critical care are lacking. This economic evaluation investigates the cost-effectiveness of a daily PCT-guided protocol to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment in adult patients with sepsis. METHODS: Two analyses were conducted, the first estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the ADAPT-Sepsis study, which recruited 2760 patients randomized to a daily PCT-guided protocol, a daily C-reactive protein-guided protocol and standard care. The second analysis used meta-analyzed results from ADAPT-Sepsis and other PCT-guided treatment studies and employed a lifetime horizon. Key outcomes were the incremental costs and QALYs gained from using the daily PCT-guided protocol approach compared with standard care. Other outcome measures included changes in days of antibiotics, days of hospital stay, days of intensive care unit stay, the percentage of deaths and the number of PCT tests performed. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results were driven by the assumed impact of PCT testing on mortality although the confidence/credible intervals for ADAPT-Sepsis and the meta-analyzed data both included no effect. Within ADAPT-Sepsis, the use of PCT tests cost euro427 more per patient and was associated with a small QALY loss (0.001), which suggests the daily PCT-guided protocol is dominated. Using meta-analyzed data, the daily PCT-guided protocol was assumed to cost euro330 more per patient but was associated with 0.139 more QALYs, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of euro2384. If only antibiotic use and PCT tests were assumed to differ then PCT testing is estimated to cost no more than euro110 per patient with QALYs equal in both arms regardless of whether ADAPT-Sepsis or meta-analyzed data were used. CONCLUSIONS: This economic analysis has shown that a PCT-guided protocol to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment could be cost-effective. Where only differences in antibiotic use and PCT testing are assumed, the increased costs per patient are modest which may be seen as worthwhile to safely improve antibiotic stewardship for critically ill adult patients with sepsis."
41316196,Effectiveness of B/F/TAF in adults with HIV who are viremic with M184V/I.,2025,"Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is indicated for people with HIV who are virologically suppressed, including those with M184V/I. Data on B/F/TAF effectiveness during viremia with M184V/I are limited. This observational study retrospectively collected clinical/demographic data from adults with viremia and M184V/I receiving B/F/TAF or alternate antiretroviral therapy (ART). Virologic suppression at 3 and >/= 6 months was evaluated. For participants with data, 5/5 (100%) and 7/8 (88%) on B/F/TAF and 4/6 (67%) and 7/10 (70%) on alternate ART achieved virologic suppression at 3 and >/= 6 months, respectively. Virologic suppression was achieved in most people with HIV who were viremic with M184V/I on B/F/TAF, as with alternate ART."
41316067,Maternal mortality ratio and deaths beyond 42 days up to 5-years post pregnancy in women living with HIV on life-long antiretroviral therapy in a resource limited setting.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remains poorly described in women living with HIV (WLWH), more so during this era of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: In a case-control cohort study design with HIV as the exposure variable, we determined MMRs from >/= 20 weeks' gestational age up to 42-days postpartum (PP) in WLWH and their peers living without HIV (WLWoH). Furthermore, mortality was assessed 43-days PP up to 5-years following delivery of the index baby. Study midwives administered socio-demographic, HIV-related, household water and sanitation questionnaires in pregnancy. At follow up visits, documented live births, maternal deaths, signs and symptoms of illnesses at death or verbal autopsy, including the place of death as per the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe' Serious Adverse Event Reporting requirements. In R-statistical package, using univariate and multivariate automated variable elimination (AVE) models, we assessed the risk factors associated with maternal deaths. RESULTS: Six-hundred (600) WLWoH, and 608 WLWH mainly on Tenofovir/Lamivudine/Efavirenz (89.3%), ART-naive (10.4%) and 0.3% ART-defaulters were enrolled. Eighteen maternal deaths were recorded over the 5-years with 56% occurring at home. Three pregnancy-related fatalities were recorded, all 3 occurring in WLWH; one case each in pregnancy (sepsis), childbirth (obstetric haemorrhage) and within 42-days PP (sepsis); giving a cohort MMR of 3/1202; 249.6 (51.5-727.6)/100000 live births, being 3/602;498.3 (102.9-1449.4)/100000 live births in WLWH. No deaths were recorded in WLWoH within 6-weeks PP while one death was observed well beyond six weeks post-delivery. WLWH were more likely to die compared to WLWoH, odds ratio (OR) 17 (2.29-129.9), p=0.006. Compared with their living peers, mortality in WLWH was associated with a new diagnosis of HIV infection, hence not on ART, p=0.027, and non-disclosure of HIV sero-status, p=0.014. In AVE regression models, WLWH with plasma HIV-RNA load of more than 1000 copies per mL were more likely to die compared to their alive HIV-RNA suppressed peers, OR 5 (1.2-24.8), p=0.03. CONCLUSION: WLWH were 17 times more likely to die when compared to WLWoH. Non-disclosure of HIV sero-status was associated with the increased odds of dying, probably due to poor adherence leading to suboptimal ART-exposure. In addition, a new HIV diagnosis, hence being ART-naive was also a significant contributing factor. There is need to address barriers hindering HIV counselling and testing, treatment, adherence and continuation to suppress HIV-RNA load to reduce MMR in WLWH on lifelong ART. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.

41316033,"Clostridium septicum causing aortic aneurysm, spondylodiscitis, and epidural abscess in an immunocompetent man.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium septicum is an opportunistic pathogen residing in the human gut flora. Due to its aerotolerance and production of exotoxins, dissemination is an uncommon but potentially lethal condition, often associated with underlying malignancy. This report represents the first described case of a patient with aortic, musculoskeletal and epidural infection caused by C. septicum. It illustrates an example of successful treatment and discusses specific treatment options in relation to current antibiotic and surgical recommendations. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of a 76-year-old man presenting with mild symptoms, who developed life-threatening complications caused by C. septicum including an aortic aneurysm as well as an epidural abscess and spondylodiscitis. The patient was successfully treated with endovascular stents in conjunction with a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged from the hospital with oral clindamycin. After more than a year on oral antibiotics the treatment was terminated, which promptly led to a relapse of C. septicum bacteremia and spondylodiscitis. Following a second hospitalization with IV therapy, lifelong suppressive antibiotic therapy was deemed necessary. CONCLUSION: C. septicum bacteremia is a severe condition that may cause multifocal infection although presenting with few clinical signs. This unique case reflects the aggressiveness of the bacteria and how antibiotic and surgical treatment should be thoughtfully considered in the presence of aortitis, epidural abscesses and spondylodiscitis."
41316021,Prognostic factors of sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically identify and evaluate prognostic risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis through a meta-analysis. METHODS: Chinese and English databases were comprehensively searched from the start of the study to January 2025. Observational studies reporting multi-variable adjusted risk ratios (HRS) for prognostic factors of sepsis in adults were included. Data extraction and quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1, and effect estimates were summarized using fixed or random effects models based on heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 69 potential factors were included. A meta-analysis was performed on 15 factors. Increase in age (HR: 1.01), acute kidney injury (HR: 1.48), cancer (HR: 1.21), liver disease (HR: 1.58), septic shock (HR: 2.22), APACHE II (HR: 1.06), SOFA (HR: 1.19), SAPS II score (HR: 1.02), lactate (HR: 1.07) and red blood cell distribution width (HR: 1.07) were significant risk factors. Diabetes (HR: 0.80) and urinary tract infection (HR: 0.47) were protective factors. A high degree of heterogeneity was observed in some factors. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors have a significant impact on the mortality of sepsis. Early identification of these risk factors can guide clinical intervention strategies and improve patient outcomes."
41315982,Accuracy is not enough: explainable boosting machine model and identification of candidate biomarkers for real-time sepsis risk assessment in the emergency department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis poses a significant threat in emergency settings, necessitating tools for early and interpretable risk assessment. This study aimed to develop a robust explainable boosting machine (EBM) model, one of the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies, to construct a predictive model that balances high accuracy and clinical interpretability for use in emergency departments (EDs) and to examine candidate biomarkers. METHODS: The study identified a significant class imbalance problem in the sepsis distribution among 560 sepsis and 1012 non-sepsis patients. To address the imbalance issue, SMOTE-NC was applied in the training data. The data was divided into two parts, 80% training and 20% testing. To ensure the reliability of the models and to report unbiased results, this process was repeated 100 times and the average performance was reported. To determine the best model for sepsis prediction, five different models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, LightGBM, and EBM) were trained, and their performances were evaluated. In the last stage, we presented local and global explanations of EBM. RESULTS: The EBM model achieved the highest success by reaching 79.1% F1-score, 80.9% sensitivity, and 84.8% AUC after resampling. In the global explanations, the variables with the highest weights in the model's decision process were identified as positive blood culture, oxygen saturation, and procalcitonin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EBM model accurately predicts sepsis risk based on clinically relevant biomarkers. The model's high performance and inherent transparency can foster trust among clinicians and facilitate its integration into emergency department workflows for real-time decision support."
41315087,Role of vitamin C infusion in postoperative mechanically ventilated neonates with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial.,2025,"This research investigated the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C administration in septic, mechanically ventilated (MV) full-term neonates following surgical interventions. This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 50 full-term neonates who required mechanical ventilation and developed confirmed sepsis after surgery. Neonates were randomly assigned to receive either standard sepsis management with placebo (No Vitamin C group) or standard protocol with vitamin C infusion, administered as a 0.5 g/kg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 g/kg/h over 6 h, continued for 7 to 10 days (Vitamin C group). Respiratory rate and peak inspiratory pressure were significantly lower at 24 h, 72 h, and 120 h in the Vitamin C group than in the No Vitamin C group. FiO(2) requirements were significantly reduced at 72 h and 120 h in the Vitamin C group. SpO(2)/FiO(2) did not change across groups at baseline and 24 h but were considerably higher in the Vitamin C group at 72 h and 120 h. Duration of MV (4.44 +/- 1.23 vs. 5.64 +/- 2.2 days, p = 0.021) and inotropic support needs (40% vs. 76%, p = 0.010) were significantly lower in the Vitamin C group. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality rates or the duration of hospitalization, including stays at neonatal intensive care units (NICU) or the hospital. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C infusion significantly improved respiratory parameters and reduced the duration of MV and inotropic support requirements in septic neonates following surgery, though it did not significantly affect the NICU or hospital length of stay or mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT06780345) (date: 17/1/2025). WHAT IS KNOWN: * In neonatal intensive care units (NICU), neonatal sepsis continues to be a major cause of death and morbidity. * Vitamin C has become a possible therapeutic intervention given its many pathways in sepsis control. WHAT IS NEW: * Vitamin C infusion significantly improved respiratory parameters and reduced the duration of MV and inotropic support requirements in septic neonates following surgery, though it did not significantly affect the NICU or hospital length of stay or mortality."
41314555,Decoding sepsis-associated encephalopathy: From blood-brain barrier injury to mechanism-based subphenotypes.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent but underrecognized complication of systemic infection, characterized by acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment in the absence of direct central nervous system infection. Despite its high morbidity and mortality, the mechanistic basis of SAE remains poorly defined, limiting early diagnosis and targeted intervention. This review synthesizes recent advances in the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of SAE, with emphasis on blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, glial cell activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter imbalance. We highlight the central role of BBB breakdown in facilitating peripheral-to-central immune signaling, which triggers a cascade of neuroinflammatory and metabolic events that collectively disrupt synaptic homeostasis and neuronal integrity. Emerging evidence also supports the existence of biologically distinct SAE subphenotypes, such as ischemic-hypoxic, inflammatory-dominant, and metabolic-degenerative types-each associated with specific molecular features and clinical outcomes. These insights underscore the need for biomarker-driven patient stratification and mechanism-targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research should prioritize the development of integrated diagnostic platforms, molecular phenotyping tools, and neuroprotective therapies that address the heterogeneous nature of SAE. A refined understanding of its pathogenesis holds promise for transforming the clinical management of SAE and improving long-term neurological recovery in sepsis survivors."
41314332,"Corticosteroids, rifampicin and LMWH impact plasma aMMP-8 and TIMP-1 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 molar ratio in methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.",2026,"OBJECTIVES: Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) predict outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). However, the impact of medications on MMPs and their prognostic capability in SAB lacks evaluation. METHODS: Prospective study with aMMP-8, TIMP-1, and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 determined in methicillin-sensitive SAB (MS-SAB). We evaluated the effect of the medications on MMPs. RESULTS: Overall, 395 patients with MS-SAB received 21 different medications. Most medications did not affect MMPs. Prehospital corticosteroids elevated day 3 aMMP-8 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P <0.01). In-hospital corticosteroids is associated with higher day 3 and 28 (P <0.01) aMMP-8 levels and higher day 3, 5, and 28 (P <0.01) aMMP-8/TIMP-1. Rifampicin elevated day 3, 5, and 28 aMMP-8 (P <0.01) and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P <0.05). Low-weight molecular heparin (LMWH) elevated day 3, 5, and 28 aMMP-8 and TIMP-1 (P <0.01) and day 5 and 28 aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P < 0.05). A prognostic survival value of aMMP-8/TIMP-1 in Cox Regression was observed for patients treated with corticosteroids, rifampicin, or LMWH. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids, rifampicin, and LMWH may elevate aMMP-8 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 levels in MS-SAB; however, the prognostic value of aMMP-8/TIMP-1 is not disrupted. Clinicians should consider the presence of corticosteroids, rifampicin, and LMWH when applying MMPs as biomarkers for risk stratification in patients with MS-SAB."
41314197,A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY ON THE TRENDS OF CAUSATIVE BACTERIA AND ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE PROFILES IN PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED SEPSIS FOLLOWING GASTRIC SLEEVE RESECTION.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Bacterial sepsis is a significant complication following open gastric sleeve surgery in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study describes the trends in causative bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles in patients who developed sepsis post-surgery, with inflammatory and glycemic biomarkers as supplementary data to elucidate sepsis pathophysiology. METHODS: The study included 128 patients (aged 25-40, BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2), T2DM) undergoing open gastric sleeve surgery and 40 individuals who underwent open gastric sleeve surgery but did not develop sepsis. Biomarkers (fasting glucose, HbA1c, procalcitonin [PCT], interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) were measured using Roche Cobas c111 and e411 analyzers. Bacterial pathogens were identified via VITEK 2, and antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer method. Statistical analyses used t-tests and chi-square tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Sepsis cases (n=40) showed significantly elevated biomarkers compared to controls (n=40): fasting glucose (143.28+/-37.79 vs. 82.85+/-8.12 mg/dL), PCT (7.60+/-3.07 vs. 0.055+/-0.031 ng/mL), TNF-alpha (17.23+/-5.04 vs. 6.62+/-2.10 pg/mL), IL-6 (12.47+/-4.63 vs. 3.06+/-1.35 pg/mL), and HbA1c (9.37+/-2.14% vs. 4.22+/-1.14%) (all p<0.001). Escherichia coli (70%) predominated, with high resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate (78.57%), ciprofloxacin (67.86%), and gentamicin (60.71%); carbapenems showed minimal resistance. Multidrug-resistant (60.71%) and extensively drug-resistant (21.43%) isolates were prevalent. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli dominates postoperative sepsis in this population, with significant AMR complicating treatment. These findings emphasize antibiotic management and tailored prophylaxis. Preoperative optimization efforts are supported by elevated biomarkers showing the role of inflammation and glucose imbalance in sepsis formation."
41314048,iNKT cells exacerbate Sepsis-associated acute lung injury through IFN-gamma-mediated promotion of macrophage apoptosis.,2026,"Sepsis is a lethal systemic inflammatory syndrome, frequently progresses to acute lung injury (ALI). This study integrates transcriptomics and Mendelian randomization to identify invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells as pivotal regulators of sepsis-associated ALI. Analysis of the GSE26378 dataset (|Log2FC| > 0.5, p < 0.05) with functional enrichment revealed immune dysregulation pathways. Bidirectional MR using FinnGen (R12_O15) and GWAS immune cell datasets (n = 731) confirmed iNKT's central role. In LPS-induced ALI models, CD1d(-/-) mice exhibited reduced pulmonary macrophage apoptosis and inflammation versus wild-type controls. In vitro, iNKT cell line DN32.D3 co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages under LPS/alpha-Galcer stimulation demonstrated IFN-gamma-dependent exacerbation of apoptosis and TNF-alpha/IL-6 releasing. IFN-gamma neutralization attenuated these effects. Transcriptomic profiling of activated iNKT cells identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) as a key mediator, with Western Blotting validation showing its marked upregulation in sepsis. Mechanistically, iNKT-IFN-gamma axis activation potentiates macrophage apoptotic susceptibility through ASC-driven pathways, amplifying cytokine storms that aggravate ALI. Therapeutic interventions targeting iNKT depletion or IFN-gamma blockade significantly mitigated lung injury metrics in both murine models and cellular systems. These findings establish iNKT cells as critical hubs linking innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in sepsis, with ASC serving as a novel regulatory node. The study provides a multi-omics framework for sepsis immunopathology, proposing targeted immunomodulation of the iNKT-IFN-gamma-Macrophages axis as a promising therapeutic strategy for ALI management."
41313607,The outcome and accuracy of doctors' decisions for patients referred to the fast-track pathway: a UK single-center retrospective audit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing need to provide care for people approaching their end-of-life phase. A fast-track pathway was developed in the UK to speed up funding of care for people expected to die within 3 months. However, the accuracy of doctors' prediction of death is variable. AIM: To investigate the accuracy of doctors' prediction of death for patients referred to the fast-track pathway and explore clinical criteria predicting early death. METHODS: A retrospective audit of hospitalized patients referred to the fast-track pathway was conducted. Patients were followed up from the date of referral to the date of death. The percentage of patients who died within 3 months was calculated. We compared clinical criteria for patients who died within the first 2 weeks to patients who died later. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of death </=7 days and </=14 days. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were referred to the fast-track pathway. Mean (SD) age was 81.1 (10.2) years, and the majority were females (n = 101; 54.6%). Most patients (n = 169; 91.4%) died within 3 months. Almost half of the patients (n = 84; 46%) died within 2 weeks. For death </=7 days, predictors were age >85 years, odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 3.6, p = 0.004, and admission with sepsis or acute organ failure, 2.8 (1.2 to 5.7), p = 0.03 and 2.6 (1.1 to 8.1), p = 0.03, respectively. For death </=14 days, predictors were age >85 years, 2.4 (1.3 to 4.5), p = 0.006, living in care home, 2.7 (1.3 to 5.8), p = 0.01, diagnosis of dementia, 1.7 (1.1 to 3.9), p = 0.04, and admission with sepsis or acute organ failure, 2.1 (1.2 to 5.6), p = 0.03 and 2.1 (1.0 to 8.9), p = 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: Doctors' prediction of death was good. Significant number of patients died early, especially very old patients with dementia, care home residents, and those presenting with sepsis or acute organ failure."
41313111,[Pneumococcal disease without apparent pulmonary involvement].,2025,"Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a classically monomicrobial infection most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( approximately 65%), followed by Gram-negative bacilli ( approximately 16%), and less frequently by Gram-positive diplococci such as Streptococcus pneumoniae ( approximately 7%), which typically reach the epidural space hematogenously from another focus, mainly respiratory. SEA can originate from hematogenous seeding or direct inoculation, and in approximately one-third of cases, the source of infection cannot be identified. We present a clinical case of SEA associated with pneumococcal bacteremia. A 65-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented with a 48-hour history of right-sided lower back pain, rendering her unable to sit or stand, with radiation to the thigh and associated fever. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed 5 and 6 mm collections in the posterior epidural space at the L4 and L5 levels. Blood cultures grew multi-sensitive S. pneumoniae, prompting initiation of antibiotic therapy with good clinical response. The traumatology team assessed the patient and obtained a sample from the larger collection, which also yielded the same pathogen. Isolated pneumococcal spinal infection is a rare but extremely serious condition, with a mortality rate exceeding 20%, and can lead to significant neurological consequences if not managed through a multidisciplinary approach involving broad-spectrum antibiotics and, in some cases, surgical intervention."
41313020,Clinical performance of the VITEK REVEAL fast antimicrobial susceptibility test within a real-world workflow for gram-negative bacteremia: comparison with QMAC-dRAST and conventional methods.,2026,"Fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is essential for appropriate antimicrobial therapeutic guidance in patients with bloodstream infections, reducing the time required for optimal treatment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of the VITEK REVEAL (REVEAL), a volatile organic compound-based fast AST system, compared with our already established AST workflow for bloodstream infections. We prospectively collected a total of 107 gram-negative isolates from positive blood cultures and performed rapid species identification using the BIOFIRE BCID2 panel, followed by AST using the REVEAL system. We conducted parallel comparative tests (QMAC-dRAST, VITEK 2, and ETEST for selected antimicrobials) and analyzed the results for categorical agreement (CA), essential agreement (EA), and categorical discrepancies. Moreover, we compared the time to results between the REVEAL vs QMAC-dRAST and VITEK2. Compared with QMAC-dRAST, REVEAL demonstrated 94.1% CA and 98.4% EA across 1,200 pairwise comparisons, with very major discrepancy (VMD) and major discrepancy (MD) rates of 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Compared to VITEK2 (872 comparisons), REVEAL yielded 94.5% CA and 97.9% EA, with VMD and MD of 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. For ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam, REVEAL showed 100% and 98.6% CA, respectively, compared to ETEST. The median final and per-antibiotic time to results for REVEAL were 8.00 h (range: 6.50-8.15 h) and 5.97 h (range: 3.17-8.15 h), respectively. The REVEAL system demonstrated high concordance with existing fast and conventional AST methods and enabled reliable susceptibility testing. These results support the potential integration of the REVEAL system into routine microbiological workflows for time-sensitive clinical decision-making in bloodstream infections. IMPORTANCE: Fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing is critical for initiating appropriate therapy in patients with gram-negative bacteria-induced bloodstream infections. Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods often require extended turnaround times, thereby delaying optimal treatment. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the VITEK REVEAL system, which detects bacterial growth-associated volatile organic compounds to directly determine antimicrobial susceptibility in positive blood cultures. We assessed the system against our already established identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods, including both fast and conventional platforms currently implemented in routine clinical practice. The volatile organic compounds-based system demonstrated high concordance, shorter time-to-results, and reliable performance for newer antimicrobial agents. By directly comparing its performance with established clinical diagnostic tools, this study provides relevant support for the potential integration of this approach into real-world laboratory workflows, with implications for improved patient management and antimicrobial stewardship."
41311806,Association of vitamin A and D deficiency and the presence of sepsis in the geriatric population: a cross-sectional study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Extensive research has established that vitamins A (VA) and D (VD) are essential to immune function. Deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with increased susceptibility to infections and more severe disease outcomes. However, the relationship between VA and VD deficiency and sepsis in geriatric persons (aged > 60 years) remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between sepsis incidence in persons over 60 and deficiencies in VA and VD. METHODS: 39 geriatric patients diagnosed with sepsis between August 2024 and April 2025 were consecutively enrolled. Among the sepsis patients, 15 succumbed during hospitalization. During the same period, 28 geriatric patients hospitalized with common infectious diseases were recruited as controls. Online medical files at the time of hospitalization were used to gather medical and laboratory information retrospectively. Everyone who participated had their peripheral blood samples taken, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry helped us assess serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 [25(OH)D2], and retinol (VA). The combined concentration of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 helped calculate the overall VD levels. SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) helped carry out all analyses. RESULTS: In comparison to controls, geriatric patients with sepsis demonstrated significantly lower serum VA and VD levels, alongside a notably higher deficiency rate for both vitamins. Correlation analyses revealed significant inverse associations between serum levels of VA and VD and the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin-6 (IL-6). Multivariate regression analysis showed that in persons over 60, deficiencies in either VA or VD were independently associated with significantly higher odds of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Vitamins A and VD deficiencies were associated with lower serum levels in geriatric sepsis patients and were inversely correlated with PCT and IL-6. Furthermore, deficiencies in either vitamin were independently associated with a higher prevalence of sepsis in this population."
41311783,Outcomes of Postoperative General Surgery Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND:  By identifying the risk factors that contribute to complications and difficulties in postoperative extubation, this study provides insights that can refine ICU strategies, guide clinical decisions, and ultimately enhance outcomes for surgical patients on mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in general surgery. METHODS:  This single-centre, hospital-based, prospective observational study included elective and emergency general surgery postoperative patients aged 18 years or older who required postoperative mechanical ventilation. The collected data included demographics, American Society of Anaesthesiologists scores (ASA), quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores (qSOFA), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), procalcitonin trends, and postoperative complications. The primary objective was to describe outcomes in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, with a focus on 30-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled during the study period, with 89 admitted to the ICU following emergency surgery and three after elective surgery. Within 30 days of surgery, mortality occurred in 59 patients, while 33 survived. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was significantly greater among non-survivors than among survivors. Both qSOFA >/= 2 and ASA > 3 scores were significantly associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the importance of clinical biomarkers and scoring systems, including qSOFA, APACHE II, international normalised ratio (INR), albumin, and procalcitonin in predicting mortality and guiding management strategies for general surgery patients requiring mechanical ventilation."
41311440,"Very rare combination of Pierre Robin sequence with patent ductus arteriosus, severe persistent pulmonary hypertension, and sepsis in an Afghan neonate: a case report and literature review.",2025,"Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a rare congenital abnormality that may complicate serious circumstances in infants. We report a very rare case of PRS in a five-day-old Afghan girl, accompanied by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), severe persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and low birth weight. The integration of these comorbidities with PRS makes the case noteworthy. The infant was initially admitted due to perinatal asphyxia and hypothermia and, was discharged in stable condition the next day. On the fifth day of life, she was readmitted with a diagnosis of PDA, severe PPHN, and sepsis, and received treatment for these conditions. Finally, the newborn died from cardiopulmonary arrest resulting from respiratory failure caused by severe airway obstruction and comorbidities. PRS may predispose the neonate to PDA, PPHN, perinatal asphyxia and infection. Consequently, it is important to treat coexisting morbidities that worsen prognosis, especially in resource-limited settings."
41311322,"Increased severity of two concurrent Campylobacter jejuni clones causing large outbreaks, Denmark, July to October 2025.",2025,"In July-October 2025, two concurrent Campylobacter jejuni outbreaks (clones ST49#3 and ST52#4) with 112 notified cases were detected through Denmark's whole genome sequencing surveillance programme. The outbreaks were clinically severe: 45 (40%) infected individuals were hospitalised and 16 (14%) had bacteraemia. We estimated 900 laboratory-confirmed outbreak cases. Both outbreaks originated from Danish-produced chicken meat. These outbreaks reveal the vulnerabilities in the current prevention and control framework given by the regulatory tolerance for Campylobacter in fresh poultry meat."
41310831,Daptomycin is associated with higher treatment failure rates than alternatives for Enterococcus faecium bloodstream infections in critically ill patients: a multicentric retrospective cohort.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Enterococcal infections represent 10% of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections and are associated with adverse outcomes, particularly in the case of E. faecium infections. Some studies focusing on non-critically ill patients have cast doubt on the non-inferiority of daptomycin compared to other antibiotics for these infections. We aimed to describe antibiotic treatment practices for monomicrobial E. faecium bloodstream infections (BSI) in patients admitted to the ICU, and to identify factors associated with treatment failure. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included adult patients presenting with a monomicrobial E. faecium BSI during their stay in one of 11 ICUs of Paris University hospitals between 2017 and 2022. Patients receiving daptomycin as a definitive antibiotic regimen were compared to those receiving another molecule using competing-risks models and propensity score-based analyses. The primary outcome was a composite criterion of treatment failure including: (1) prolonged bacteremia (>/=3days) under treatment and/or (2) relapse within 30 days after the end of treatment and/or (3) the need for salvage therapy within 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 166 included patients, 26 received daptomycin as a definitive antibiotic regimen, at a median dose of 10 [10-10] mg/kg/day and 140 patients received non-daptomycin-based regimens (vancomycin (69%), linezolid (19%) or a beta-lactam (11%)). Source of BSI was predominantly unknown (38%), digestive (37%) or an intravascular device (16%). All isolates were vancomycin-susceptible. Median daptomycin MIC was 3 [2-3.25] mg/L. Time to adequate antibiotic regimen (1 [0-2] vs 1 [0-2] days, p=0.22) and rates of source control (63% vs 43%, p=0.17) were not different between groups. Regarding primary outcome, daptomycin as a definitive antibiotic regimen was associated with a higher rate of treatment failure in the multivariate adjusted analysis using a Fine and Gray model (aSHR 2.53 [1.14-5.62], p=0.022). Sensitivity analyses using propensity score overlap weighting (HR 2.48 [1.05-5.86], p=0.038) or with only patients treated by vancomycin as comparators (aSHR 2.26 [1.00-5.10], p=0.051) yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter retrospective cohort of critically ill patients with monomicrobial E. faecium bloodstream infections, use of daptomycin as the definitive antibiotic regimen was associated with a higher rate of treatment failure. Further prospective studies are needed."
41310791,Association between prognostic nutritional index and 90-day mortality in septic patients: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and 90-day mortality among patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV database for patients diagnosed with sepsis. Covariates were selected using Cox regression models. The association between PNI and 90-day mortality was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. We further examined the potential nonlinear relationship using restricted cubic spline(RCS) analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for these groups, and the differences in 90-day survival rates were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 5,786 septic patients were included in the final analysis. The overall 90-day mortality rate after ICU admission was 35.0% (n = 2,027). In the fully adjusted Cox model, a higher PNI was associated with a reduced risk of 90-day mortality. Specifically, for each one-unit increase in PNI, the risk of 90-day mortality decreased by 1% (adjusted HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98 ~ 1.00, P = 0.004). The RCS analysis revealed a significant nonlinear relationship between PNI and 90-day mortality (P(nonlinearity) < 0.001). The log-rank test confirmed a statistically significant difference in survival curves between the low and high PNI groups (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: PNI demonstrates a significant nonlinear inverse association with 90-day mortality in patients with sepsis. These findings suggest that PNI could serve as a valuable prognostic tool. Clinicians may use PNI to identify high-risk patients and implement targeted interventions to potentially improve clinical outcomes."
41310736,Predictive enrichment using biomarkers in studies of critically-ill patients with sepsis: a systematic review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains one of the most prevalent conditions necessitating admission to intensive care units and is associated with high mortality. Unfortunately, randomized trials examining therapeutics for critically-ill patients with sepsis have been disproportionately negative, failing to identify effective interventions, likely due to the dilution of treatment effects across highly diverse populations. Designing trials to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from an intervention based on biologic mechanism, known as predictive enrichment, may be an effective strategy for enhancing clinical trial efficacy. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the use of biological markers (biomarkers) used for predictive enrichment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted this review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. We included RCTs that enrolled adult patients with sepsis that used molecular biomarkers for predictive enrichment in their study design. We summarize study characteristics, biomarkers used, predictive enrichment strategies, and trial outcomes narratively without statistical pooling. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Of the 1,718 citations found with the search, we included 12 eligible studies. All studies used either blood-based circulating proteins or lipopolysaccharide markers for predictive enrichment. Five studies (42%) reported statistically significant impacts on the primary outcome, with three showing patient-important benefit (reduced mortality or disease severity) and two demonstrating improvements in surrogate outcomes related to biomarkers. Interventions that demonstrated benefit included immune, antimicrobial or coagulation modulating therapies. These five trials that showed benefit used suPAR, AT, mHLA-DR, IL-6 and EAA as biomarkers for predictive enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: This review characterizes the use of biomarkers for predictive enrichment in randomized trials of critically-ill patients with sepsis. Although the studies were heterogeneous in design and limited in number, those that employed biomarker-based enrichment strategies demonstrate a promising signal for enhanced clinical trial efficiency. The use of biomarkers for predictive enrichment in critical care trial design requires further exploration, investigation and validation."
41310566,"Spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus secondary to fulminant pelvic infection: a case report.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus is an exceedingly rare and life-threatening gynecological emergency. This report details a unique case of such a rupture in a postmenopausal woman, secondary to a fulminant pelvic infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old grand multipara postmenopausal woman, with a history of recurrent lower abdominal pain, presented with severe abdominal pain, malodorous vaginal discharge, and fever of six days duration. Physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with guarding, and laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and anemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed intra-abdominal collection with an echo complex mass in the paracolic gutter, suggestive of abscess collection in the abdominoplevic cavity. Due to hemodynamic instability, the patient was resuscitated with crystalloids and underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy involving both surgical and gynecologic teams. Intraoperatively, about 2000 ml of purulent material was sucked out, and the uterine fundus was found ruptured, necrotic, and eaten up for which a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done. Microbiological analysis confirmed Escherichia coli infection, and histopathology ruled out malignancy, showing only inflammatory changes. CONCLUSION: A spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus resulted from fulminant pelvic infection, establishing chronic pelvic inflammatory disease as an etiology through direct tissue erosion. This case underscores the necessity of considering genital tract sepsis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen and highlights the critical importance of emergent surgical intervention, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and rigorous adherence to PID management guidelines for preventing this life-threatening complication."
41308922,Catheter-related bloodstream infection by Kocuria rhizophila in a dialysis patient.,2026,"Catheter related bloodstream infections are a common concern in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. We report a case of CKD with an indwelling left IJV Permacath who developed fever and chills during dialysis. Investigations showed leukocytosis, elevated CRP (75 mg/L), and procalcitonin (9.1 ng/mL). Paired blood cultures grew Kocuria rhizophila, identified by MALDI-TOF, with a two-hour difference in positivity indicating CRBSI. Vancomycin led to improvement and antibiotic lock therapy was initiated. This case highlights that rare organisms such as K. rhizophila can be true pathogens in dialysis patients, and correct identification with MALDI-TOF alongside clinical correlation is crucial for appropriate management."
41308799,Association between enoxaparin administration and ICU 28-day mortality in sepsis patients: A comparative study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on enoxaparin use in sepsis patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) with platelet counts >/=150 x 10(9)/L, and its survival benefit remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between enoxaparin administration and intensive care unit (ICU) 28-day mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study that utilized data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The relationship between enoxaparin administration and ICU 28-day mortality was primarily investigated using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPTW) based on the propensity score. RESULTS: A total of 2078 sepsis patients requiring MV with platelet counts >/=150 x 10(9)/L were included in the study. The median age of the cohort was 66 years (interquartile range, 54-76 years). Enoxaparin was administered to 483 patients (23.2 %), while 1595 patients (76.8 %) did not receive enoxaparin. Of the 483 patients who received enoxaparin, 374 patients (18.0 % of the total cohort) were administered it on the first day of ICU admission. The ICU 28-day mortality was 7.2 % (35/483) in the enoxaparin group compared to 13.9 % (222/1595) in the non-enoxaparin group. In the IPTW analysis, there was a significant association between enoxaparin administration and ICU 28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 0.6; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9; p = 0.010]. CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin administration was associated with a lower risk of ICU 28-day mortality among sepsis patients requiring MV with platelet counts >/=150 x 10(9)/L. Given the observational nature of the study, further research is needed to confirm these findings."
41308245,"Antimicrobial resistance, genomic, and public health insights into Enterococcus spp. from Australian cattle.",2026,"OBJECTIVES: Enterococci are opportunistic, sometimes life-threatening pathogens with increasing antimicrobial resistance, particularly among clinical human isolates in Australia. While recent studies have ruled out pigs and chickens as major reservoirs of resistant enterococci, the role of cattle remains unclear. This study examines the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of enterococci from Australian cattle and explores the phylogenetic relationship of bovine E. faecium with isolates from other livestock and human sepsis cases. METHODS: A total of 1001 bovine faecal samples were tested, yielding E. faecium (n = 343), E. faecalis (n = 92), and E. hirae (n = 284). Minimum inhibitory concentration assays were conducted against 15 antimicrobials. A subset of 67 isolates underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Most isolates were wild-type to all tested antimicrobials. Resistance was most common to erythromycin in E. faecium (18.7 %), daptomycin in E. faecalis (12.1 %), and tetracycline in E. hirae (13.3 %). A single E. faecalis isolate was non-wild-type to vancomycin, and nine isolates (E. faecium n = 4, E. faecalis n = 2, E. hirae n = 3) showed linezolid resistance. However, WGS did not detect known resistance genes or mutations for vancomycin or linezolid. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that bovine E. faecium clustered with other livestock isolates and vancomycin-negative human isolates. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among enterococci from Australian cattle is low. These strains are genetically distinct from vancomycin-resistant E. faecium circulating in hospitals, suggesting that cattle are not a significant source of clinically relevant AMR enterococci in Australia."
41307996,GM-CSF and specific type 2 cytokines induce CD103(+) and CD301b(+) cell states in cDC1s and cDC2s.,2025,"The heterogeneity of conventional dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1s) and type 2 (cDC2s) is well established, yet the identity and origin of CD301b(+) cDC2s remain debated. Here, we show that CD301b(+) cDC2s and CD103(+) cDC1s develop from pre-committed progenitors in response to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). While CD103(+) cDC1s acquire their phenotype and functional properties through GM-CSF-driven differentiation from pre-cDC1s, CD301b(+) cDC2s emerge as cytokine-induced states from DC2- and DC3-committed progenitors. CD103(+) cDC1s and CD301b(+) cDC2s exhibit enhanced T cell priming capacities and distinct cytokine expression profiles upon GM-CSF exposure. In vivo, DC-intrinsic GM-CSF sensing is dispensable for acquiring CD103 and CD301b expression with the notable exception of lung DCs, while specific type 2 cytokines induce CD103 and CD301b ex vivo. These findings identify GM-CSF and specific type 2 cytokines as central regulators of cDC1 and cDC2 effector differentiation and establish CD301b as a marker of a cytokine-driven cDC2 state."
41307948,Clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in hospitalized patients: a prospective cohort study in Libya.,2025,"Introduction. Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) are a major cause of mortality, with limited treatment options.Gap/Hypothesis. Despite the global rise of MDR-GNB, prospective data on their clinical impact in North Africa remain scarce, restricting evidence-based guidance for empiric therapy.Aim. To assess the prevalence, resistance patterns and clinical outcomes of MDR-GNB BSIs in Libya, and to identify predictors of 30-day mortality.Methodology. A prospective cohort study was conducted in two Libyan hospitals between November 2022 and November 2024. Adult patients with positive blood cultures were enrolled. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2023 guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality.Results. Among 673 BSI episodes, 37.4% were multidrug resistance (MDR). Escherichia coli (32.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (25.9%) predominated, while carbapenem resistance was highest in Acinetobacter baumannii (42.4%). Overall, 30-day mortality was 23.8%, and was significantly higher in MDR infections (32.1% vs 18.8%; P<0.001). Independent predictors of mortality were MDR infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.9], Intensive care Unit (ICU) admission (aOR, 2.6), Charlson Comorbidity Index >/=3 (aOR, 1.7) and inappropriate empiric therapy (aOR, 2.3).Conclusion. MDR-GNB BSIs are highly prevalent in Libya and substantially worsen outcomes. These findings highlight the urgent need for improved empiric therapy, antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes."
41306613,Identification and validation of potential shared diagnostic markers for sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy via WGCNA and machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis frequently results in complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiomyopathy. This study aims to identify common diagnostic markers and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these sepsis-induced complications. METHODS: We obtained datasets related to ARDS and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) from the GEO database and applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were integrated with key module genes. Feature genes were selected using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF) algorithms. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was constructed and its diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Machine learning algorithms effectively identified key hub genes associated with sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy, with their robustness validated through ROC analysis. A cellular model of sepsis-induced lung injury was employed to examine hub gene expression. Additionally, we investigated inflammation and immune responses by characterizing immune landscapes using CIBERSORT and performing correlation analyses among feature genes, immune infiltration, and clinical characteristics. Finally, potential small-molecule compounds were identified from the PubChem database. RESULTS: Five key genes-LCN2, AIF1L, STAT3, SOCS3 and SDHD-were identified. SOCS3 showed strong diagnostic potential with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) highlighting its role in biological processes and immune responses. SOCS3 expression correlated strongly with immune cells. Dexamethasone, resveratrol and curcumin were identified as potential SOCS3-targeting drugs. CONCLUSION: Five genes were identified as diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy, with SOCS3 serving as a key hub gene and potential therapeutic target."
41306596,First report of bloodstream infection caused by Apiotrichum veenhuisii in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,2025,"Apiotrichum veenhuisii (A. veenhuisii), a type of yeast found widely in nature, is a rare pathogen that induces human infection globally. Here, we report a case of a female patient with recurrent B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who developed severe febrile neutropenia following systemic chemotherapy. In the meantime, a certain species of fungus was repeatedly detected in her peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures. This strain was ultimately identified as A. veenhuisii through morphological examination and molecular genetic analysis. Fungemia was therefore diagnosed. After amphotericin B and voriconazole treatments, the patient's symptoms were resolved remarkably. No recurrent B-ALL was found in her bone marrow at 3 months of follow-up. This is the first evidence worldwide of bloodstream infection caused by A. veenhuisii in humans as far as we know. A precise aetiological diagnosis guides us on the correct path of antifungal treatment at a very early stage, making the patient recover with a favorable prognosis. Further functional annotation and phylogenetic analysis were performed after the whole genome was sequenced. This may help us better understand the biological characteristics and evolutionary relationships of this species."
41306522,"Predictors of mortality among neonates in Lusaka, Zambia: a comparative analysis of machine learning and traditional survival analysis techniques.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal mortality remains a critical global health issue, with 2.3 million deaths in 2022. Sub-Saharan Africa bears 57% of under five deaths despite only 30% of global births, with Zambia ranking fourth highest in terms of neonatal mortality among neighboring countries. While traditional survival analysis has identified neonatal mortality risk factors, machine learning-based prediction remains underexplored. This study aimed to identify factors associated with neonatal mortality and compare the predictive performance of traditional survival analysis and machine learning models among neonates in Lusaka, Zambia (January2018-September 2019). METHODS: Demographic and clinical data from 1,018 neonates were analyzed using seven models: Weibull, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net (regularized Cox), Random Survival Forests, DeepSurv neural networks and Gradient Boosting Machines. Model performance was evaluated using nested cross-validation with five outer folds and three inner folds for hyperparameter tuning. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the concordance index, time dependent area under the curve at 7, 14, and 28 days, brier scores, and calibration plots. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrated survival probabilities over time. RESULTS: Of the 1,018 neonates, 757 (74.3%) died. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (TR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.81) was associated with reduced survival, while higher birthweight was protective (TR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.60-2.20). Sepsis demonstrated a paradoxical association with longer survival (TR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30), which persisted in sensitivity analyses. Among predictive models, the Random Survival Forests achieved the highest discrimination (C-index = 0.731) and consistently low Brier scores, outperforming Weibull (C-index = 0.622) and penalized Cox models ( approximately 0.620). Gradient Boosting Machines were most miscalibrated, and DeepSurv showed low discrimination (C-index = 0.553). Feature importance analysis from Random Survival Forest identified birth weight as the dominant predictor, followed by sex, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. DISCUSSION: While traditional Weibull models remain valuable for interpretability, machine learning approaches provide enhanced predictive accuracy. Hybrid modeling strategies may improve early risk identification and inform neonatal care in resource-limited settings."
41306471,Infected left ventricular thrombus confirmed by FDG PET/CT presenting as persistent Streptococcus anginosus bacteraemia in ischaemic cardiomyopathy: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Infected left ventricular (LV) thrombus is a rare but serious complication in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It is associated with persistent bacteraemia, systemic embolization, and stroke. Diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion, supported by multimodal imaging and coordinated multidisciplinary management. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 69-year-old man with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), prior multi-territory stroke due to LV thrombus, and multiple comorbidities, who was admitted with reduced GCS following ICU treatment for Streptococcus anginosus septic shock. Despite several antibiotic courses, he experienced recurrent bacteraemia over 6 months with no clear source. Given his history, an infected LV thrombus and infective endocarditis were considered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated recurrence of an apical thrombus, which was confirmed on transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) without valvular vegetations. FDG positron emission tomography (PET) showed focal uptake at the LV apex in a circular pattern with central photopenia, consistent with an infected thrombus. He was managed with 6 weeks of intravenous benzylpenicillin followed by 6 months of oral amoxicillin, alongside warfarin anticoagulation. Surgery was not pursued due to frailty and comorbidities. He improved clinically with the resolution of bacteraemia. Follow-up PET and TTE were planned to assess the response. DISCUSSION: This case represents one of the few PET-confirmed infected LV thrombus presenting with persistent S. anginosus bacteraemia. It highlights the diagnostic value of multimodal imaging, particularly PET/CT in distinguishing infected thrombus from sterile thrombus and endocarditis, and underscores the importance of prolonged antibiotic therapy, anticoagulation, and multidisciplinary management."
41306437,Stress-induced hyperglycemia and mortality of non-diabetic patients with sepsis: a meta-analysis.,2025,"Stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) is a common metabolic response in critically ill patients, but its prognostic significance in non-diabetic patients with sepsis remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SIH and short-term mortality in this population. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for relevant observational studies. SIH was defined by study-specific early admission blood glucose cutoffs. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model by incorporating the influence of heterogeneity. Thirteen studies encompassing 53,073 non-diabetic septic patients were included. Overall, SIH was associated with significantly increased mortality (RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.45-2.11, p < 0.001; I(2) = 72%), with a 95% prediction interval of 1.18-2.61, indicating that the association is expected to persist in most future study populations despite heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses confirmed the association across prospective and retrospective/post-hoc studies (RR: 2.01 vs. 1.63, p = 0.29), different sepsis severities (RR: 1.60 vs. 2.26, p = 0.12), diagnostic criteria (Sepsis-2.0: 1.84 vs. Sepsis-3.0: 1.73, p = 0.80), timing of SIH assessment (at admission, within 24 h, or 48 h; p = 0.16), and glucose cutoffs (7.8, 11.1, 16.7 mmol/L; p = 0.34). Notably, SIH showed a stronger association with ICU/in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.25) compared with 1-month (1.63) or 3-12-month mortality (1.35; p = 0.001). Meta-regression showed no significant effect of study characteristics (p all > 0.05). In conclusion, SIH defined by early admission blood glucose is significantly associated with increased short-term mortality in non-diabetic septic patients. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition and monitoring of SIH in this high-risk population.

41305822,S100A12 as a key biomarker in a neutrophil-associated gene prediction model for sepsis diagnosis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. As a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units patients, it still lacks sensitive biomarkers. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a diagnostic model for sepsis and identify key driver biomarkers. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the GEO database, we constructed a diagnostic model through 113 machine learning (ML) frameworks, supplemented with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to identify pivotal genes. Results revealed a significant increase in myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the peripheral blood of sepsis patients. Screening identified 70 upregulated and 762 downregulated neutrophil-associated genes, which were intersected with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy controls and sepsis patients, yielding 13 overlapping genes - including S100A12 - as potential drivers. These 13 genes were incorporated into 113 ML models. The Random Forest (RF) model, which included S100A12, PIK3AP1, HLA-DMB, and RETN, achieved the highest mean C-index with fewer features. Its robust diagnostic performance was validated using receiver operator characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. SHAP analysis highlighted S100A12 as the most influential driver gene and identified theophylline, aspirin, and aminophylline as potential targeting compounds. In conclusion, sepsis patients show increased peripheral neutrophils, an RF model based on 4 neutrophil-associated genes demonstrates strong diagnostic ability, and S100A12 serves as a key biomarker for sepsis."
41305720,Association between neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by an imbalanced host response to infection and remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) has recently emerged as a novel biomarker that integrates information on systemic inflammation and nutritional status. However, its role in predicting outcomes among septic patients has yet to be fully clarified. This study aimed to investigate the association between NPAR and all-cause mortality at 28-day, 90-day, and 365 day in patients diagnosed with sepsis. Using the medical information mart for intensive care-IV v3.1 database, we identified 6242 patients meeting the Sepsis-3.0 definition. Participants were categorized into tertiles based on NPAR values (Q1 < 23.8; 23.8 </= Q2 < 30.1; Q3 >/= 30.1). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to analyze associations between NPAR and mortality. Restricted cubic spline models assessed nonlinear trends, while receiver operating characteristic curves evaluated discriminative ability. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to visualize survival differences across NPAR groups. Patients in the highest NPAR tertile (Q3) exhibited significantly greater disease severity and higher mortality at 28 days (34.03% vs 22.28%), 90 days (43.54% vs 28.93%), and 365 days (52.33% vs 37.72%) compared to those in the lowest tertile (Q1; all P < .001). After adjusting for confounders, elevated NPAR remained an independent predictor of mortality at 28 days (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), 90 days (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.40), and 365 days (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.35). Restricted cubic spline analyses revealed a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between NPAR and mortality (P for nonlinearity < .001). Integrating NPAR with the sequential organ failure assessment score significantly enhanced predictive accuracy compared to sequential organ failure assessment alone (area under the curve: 0.624 vs 0.599, P < .001). Subgroup analysis indicated a more pronounced association in patients with congestive heart failure (P for interaction = .002). High NPAR levels are independently associated with increased short- and long-term mortality in sepsis. Given its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, NPAR could be a useful marker for early risk assessment and clinical decision-making in septic populations."
41305715,Exploring the biomarkers for diagnostic accuracy associated with glycolysis and macrophage polarization in pediatric sepsis and performing mechanistic studies.,2025,"The pediatric sepsis (PS) is characterized by severe clinical symptoms and high mortality. There was a lack of studies on the mechanisms of glycolysis and macrophage polarization (MP) in PS. The focus of this study was to identify biomarkers associated with glycolysis and MP in PS and to conduct mechanistic studies. The GSE26440 and GSE13904 datasets, glycolysis-related genes and macrophage polarization-related genes (MPRGs) were used in this study for analysis. First, to identify differentially expressed genes in GSE26440. Next, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis was taken to obtain key modular genes related between glycolysis and MP, and differentially expressed genes were overlapped with key modular genes to identify candidate genes. Subsequently, biomarkers were detected to biomarkers by constructing a protein-protein interaction network, machine learning and expression validation. Finally, based on the biomarkers, functional enrichment, regulatory network, immune microenvironment analysis, and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. After screening, 4 biomarkers (a disintegrin and a metalloprotease9 [ADAM9], transforming growth factor alpha [TGFA], G protein subunit alpha q [GNAQ], and decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 1 [PDSS1]) were obtained. The lysosome and fc gamma r mediated phagocytosis co-targeted 4 biomarkers in gene set enrichment analysis. Spearman correlation analysis showed that ADAM9, TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1 were significantly positively related to activated dendritic cells, and had a significantly negative correlation with activated B cells. Next, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs)-MicroRNAs (miRNAs)-mRNA network containing 7 microRNAs and 23 lncRNAs was constructed. The hsa-miR-302c-5P co-targeted ADAM9, TGFA, and PDSS1. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PS samples. In this study, 4 biomarkers (ADAM9, TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1) associated with glycolysis and MP were identified to provide scientific theories for the clinical management of PS."
41305706,Impact of medical history of severe COVID-19 infection on serum cytokine levels and prognosis in patients with sepsis: A prospective observational study.,2025,"A history of severe COVID-19 may have lasting effects on immune and coagulation dysfunction, potentially influencing sepsis outcomes. This study investigates the impact of severe COVID-19 history on inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and prognosis in sepsis patients. This prospective observational study included 181 sepsis patients, comprising 28 with a history of severe COVID-19 infection and 153 without such a history, admitted between October 2021 and May 2023. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, IL-17, and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Coagulation markers activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and D-dimer (D-D), inflammatory factor procalcitonin (PCT), and severity scores sequential organ failure assessment and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II were assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate 28-day mortality and associated risk factors. Patients with severe COVID-19 history showed significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores, along with elevated APTT, PCT, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-17 levels. CRP and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not differ significantly. Among patients with poor prognosis, IL-6, IL-17, and APTT levels were higher, and a larger proportion had a history of severe COVID-19 (36.8% vs 5.6%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed reduced 28-day survival in the severe COVID-19 group. Multivariate analysis identified BMI, sex, diabetes, severe COVID-19 history, PCT, D-D, and IL-17 as independent risk factors for poor outcomes. Sepsis patients with a history of severe COVID-19 exhibit more severe disease, immune dysregulation, coagulation abnormalities, and increased mortality, indicating long-term detrimental effects of prior infection on sepsis prognosis."
41305541,Development of a Mass Antiviral Screening System Using Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus as an RNA Surrogate and Activity Confirmation with a Fish Rhabdovirus.,2025,"With emerging viruses and drug resistance on the rise, the discovery and development of innovative antiviral substances and agents are necessary for the effective treatment and control of viral outbreaks. Surrogate viruses are safer alternatives used in research to mimic dangerous or hard-to-culture viruses. They enable efficient, ethical, and cost-effective screening of antiviral compounds. In this study, we used a recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (rVHSV) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein as a surrogate for RNA viruses for the high-throughput screening of antiviral agents. An optimized mixture of viruses and EPC host cells was distributed in 96-well plates containing chemical compounds or plant extracts for screening. Using this system, 44,642 chemical compounds and 8104 plant and marine organism extracts were tested; 140 candidates were selected from primary screening, and 8 compounds and 5 plant extracts were further selected based on the selectivity index (SI), representing the ratio of the cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) to the inhibition concentration (IC(50)). Among these, compound 3, which had the highest SI value of 1046, was further tested, considering in vitro activity against VHSV and another fish rhabdovirus, snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV)."
41305493,Evaluation of the Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide in Patients with Low-Level Viremia Under Chronic Hepatitis B Treatment.,2025,"In this multicenter, retrospective study involving 62 patients, we investigated whether switching from entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) represents a superior treatment strategy for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experiencing low-level viremia (LLV). The study determined that TAF significantly improved both virological and biochemical outcomes. At 48 weeks, the complete virological response (CVR) rate was 77.8% for those who switched from ETV and 81.8% for those who switched from TDF, with Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) negativity reaching 81% by month 12. Additionally, significant normalization of liver enzymes, albumin, and platelet counts was observed across the cohort. While the switch from TDF was associated with a significant increase in triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), no such changes were detected in the ETV group. This evidence suggests that TAF provides robust virological control in LLV patients and is associated with favorable biochemical improvements. However, due to the study's limitations, the strong assertion that TAF promotes the regression of liver fibrosis and reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) must be interpreted with caution."
41305467,Simultaneous ASFV and Haptoglobin Detection by Duplex qPCR Enables Pre-Viremia Diagnosis of African Swine Fever.,2025,"African swine fever (ASF), caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), has inflicted severe economic losses on China's pig industry. Existing ASFV nucleic acid detection methods struggle to identify infected pigs in the pre-viremic stage, especially for recently emerged recombinant ASFV strains that exhibit delayed clinical symptoms and prolonged virus shedding, posing great challenges to ASF prevention and control. To fit the problem, this study established a TaqMan duplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay targeting the ASFV p72 gene and porcine Hp gene for early diagnosis of ASFV infection. The qPCR reaction system (20 muL) and conditions were optimized and showed high sensitivity, with detection limits of 1.42 x 10(1) copies/muL for Hp and 2.23 x 10(1) copies/muL for ASFV, as well as excellent specificity and reproducibility. Serum cDNA samples from pigs infected with virulent or recombinant ASFV strains were tested, and the result showed that Hp was detectable as early as 1 day post-infection (DPI), however ASFV remained undetectable until 3DPI. Then cDNA samples from cohabitation infection were tested and 80% samples were Hp-positive, although ASFV test was negative.In conclusion, this duplex qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of Hp and ASFV enables pre-viremia diagnosis of ASF, providing a valuable tool for early screening of ASFV-infected pigs."
41305422,Resistance Landscape and Clonal Dynamics of ESKAPE Pathogens in Bloodstream Infections: A Multicenter Study from Mexico.,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance in healthcare-associated infections represents one of the greatest threats to global health. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted infection control and antimicrobial stewardship, potentially affecting the prevalence of pathogens and the development of resistance. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and clonal dissemination of ESKAPE pathogens isolated from bloodstream infections during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic in four tertiary-care hospitals in Mexico. A total of 926 isolates were analyzed: Staphylococcus aureus (22.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%), Acinetobacter baumannii (21.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.8%). High rates of multidrug resistance were observed in A. baumannii (70.9% XDR) and K. pneumoniae (71% XDR plus MDR with 79% ESBL). P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae showed the highest susceptibility rates (53% and 48%, respectively) to all antimicrobials. The main beta-lactamases involved in resistance were bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), and bla(TEM) in K. pneumoniae, while the predominant carbapenemases were bla(OXA-24), bla(OXA-23) in A. baumannii, bla(NDM) in K. pneumoniae, and bla(VIM) in P. aeruginosa. Among Gram-positives, methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 33.8% of isolates, and vancomycin resistance was higher in E. faecium (28%) than in E. faecalis (1.3%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed endemic circulation of A. baumannii clones (Pulsotypes 1AC, 2AM), persistent for over a decade, and interhospital dissemination of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae clones. These findings underscore the epidemiological relevance of MDR ESKAPE pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the urgent need to optimize empirical therapy and maintain continuous genomic surveillance to enhance infection control in Mexican hospitals."
41305391,Outcomes of Hospitalized Octogenarians with E. coli Bacteremia-Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"Background:Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia is a significant cause of mortality, particularly in older adults. Limited data exists on clinical outcomes in octogenarians. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of E. coli bacteremia in octogenarians and determine whether appropriate empirical therapy leads to improved outcomes in this specific population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with E. coli bacteremia at Beilinson Hospital from January 2012 to December 2022. Clinical characteristics, bacteremia sources, antibiotic resistance patterns, and patient outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Multivariate regression was used to assess the impact of empirical antibiotic appropriateness on mortality. Results: The study included 2717 patients, of which 1042 (38%) were 80 years or older. Older patients had more comorbidities with increased rates of ischemic heart disease (20% vs. 14%, p < 0.01) and congestive heart failure (19% vs. 9%, p < 0.01). Patients with 3rd generation cephalosporin resistant strains were more likely to receive inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy (54% vs. 23%, p < 0.01). Although appropriate empirical therapy was associated with improved survival in univariate analysis (19% vs. 28%, p < 0.01), it was not an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in multivariate analysis [adjusted OR = 1.10, 95% CI (0.64-1.81), p = 0.7]. A lower SOFA score [adjusted OR = 0.17, CI95% (0.01-0.31), p < 0.01] was associated with decreased 30-day mortality. Hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality [adjusted OR = 2.49, CI95% (0.1.56-3.97), p < 0.01]. Conclusions:E. coli bacteremia in octogenarians is associated with significant mortality. While timely appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial, mortality appears to be more influenced by overall health status, comorbidities, and infection severity. Future research should focus on addressing these factors and developing personalized care strategies to improve survival in this high-risk group."
41305346,Whole Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomics of the Emerging Pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei Isolated from Two Travel-Related Infections in Hungary.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a neglected tropical pathogen that has been increasingly encountered in Europe through travel-related infections. Clinical manifestations range from localized abscesses to life-threatening sepsis, posing diagnostic challenges in non-endemic regions. METHODS: We report two travel-associated melioidosis cases confirmed in Hungary between 2008 and 2024. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and core-genome MLST (cgMLST) were performed for molecular characterization. In parallel, a systematic review of travel-related melioidosis cases reported in Europe (1980-2025) was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the PubMLST database. RESULTS: In silico MLST identified two distinct sequence types (STs): a novel ST1643, and ST1051, previously reported in Asia and Australia. Both isolates clustered within the Asian clade, confirming an imported origin. Virulence profiling revealed major determinants, including the Yersinia-like fimbriae (YLF) cluster, fhaB3, and ITS type C. The ST1643 isolate carried the bimA(Bm) variant and multiple resistance genes (blaOXA-57, blaPenI, and amrAB efflux system), while ST1051 harbored blaOXA-59. The literature review identified 82 studies encompassing 195 European cases, most originating from Southeast Asia, with pneumonia, followed by septic form and abscess as the predominant presentation. We found only eight neuromelioidosis cases in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report of neuromelioidosis in Hungary, and the first global description of ST1643. Combined genomic and epidemiological data highlight the need for improved clinical awareness, genomic surveillance, and diagnostic preparedness in non-endemic regions, as global travel and climate change expand the distribution of melioidosis."
41305178,Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Oedema Quantification: An Ex Vivo Porcine Skin Model.,2025,"Oedema is a common clinical finding in critically ill neonates and may reflect systemic illness such as congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. Oedema is characterised by tissue swelling due to water accumulation in the interstitial space. Currently, the gold standard in clinical practice is visual assessment, which is subjective and limited in accuracy. Alternative methods, such as ultrasound and bioimpedance, have been explored; however, they are unsuitable in neonates and do not provide direct water quantification. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical method that could measure water content through light interaction between near-infrared light and OH particles within the tissue. This study validated NIRS for oedema assessment using an ex vivo porcine skin model, where controlled oedema was induced by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection. Continuous spectroscopic data were collected via optical fibres positioned perpendicularly and parallel to the tissue. Regression models were developed and evaluated using the spectral data, with partial least squares (PLS) regression outperforming ridge regression (RR) and support vector regression (SVR). Notably, spectra acquired in the parallel configuration yielded superior results (R(2) = 0.97, RMSE = 0.15). These findings support the potential of NIRS as a reliable, quantitative tool for neonatal oedema assessment."
41304283,Phenyllactic Acid as a Marker of Antibiotic-Induced Metabolic Activity of Nosocomial Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae In Vitro Experiment.,2025,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a major nosocomial pathogen with increasing antibiotic resistance. Treatment failures and high mortality rates in sepsis caused by K. pneumoniae are associated with difficulties in choosing an adequate antibacterial therapy in the presence of resistance to all available antibiotics, based on the results of susceptibility tests. This study aimed to identify ""weak points"" in the metabolism of K. pneumoniae, to be able to use these features in the future. Ten nosocomial K. pneumoniae strains were incubated with fourteen broad-spectrum antibiotics representing major drug classes. Aromatic metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after 24 h exposure. Phenyllactic acid (PhLA), comprising 86% of detected phenylcarboxylic acids, served as the metabolic activity marker. Antibiotics demonstrated multidirectional effects on aromatic compound metabolism. Doxycycline, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, and tigecycline significantly suppressed metabolic activity, confirmed by decreased PhLA levels. Conversely, meropenem, cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefepime, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime), ciprofloxacin, and amikacin stimulated PhLA production, suggesting that bacterial metabolic activity was maintained despite the presence of antibiotics. PhLA is a promising biomarker for quantifying K. pneumoniae's metabolic response to antibiotics. This potentially introduces a novel approach for future investigations into resistance mechanisms and has the potential to increase the effectiveness of therapies for multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae infections by providing an additional analytical tool to traditional susceptibility testing methodologies."
41303885,"Evaluation of Hematological, Biochemical, and Coagulation Tests in Patients with Hepatitis C.",2025,"Background and Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a significant cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. While direct-acting antivirals achieve high cure rates, the interplay between viral load, gender, and routine laboratory parameters remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate hematological, biochemical, and coagulation profiles, as well as derived non-invasive indices, in HCV-infected patients, stratified by gender and viremia levels. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 367 patients with HCV infection (223 males and 144 females). Patients were divided into four groups: high viremia males (hiVM), high viremia females (hiVF), low viremia males (loVM), and low viremia females (loVF), using 800,000 IU/mL as the threshold. Routine hematological, biochemical, and coagulation tests were conducted, and derived indices (FIB-4, APRI, AST/ALT ratio, PLR, NLR, SII, AISI, PNI, HALP, PAR, NAR) were calculated. Results: Significant gender- and viremia-specific differences were observed. hiVM showed higher erythrocyte indices and altered coagulation parameters, whereas hiVF had increased lymphocyte counts and AST/ALT ratio elevation. loVM displayed reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit, along with worse coagulation results. Biochemical analysis revealed gender differences in GGT, bilirubin, and albumin levels. Among derived indices, FIB-4 and APRI were higher in loVM, while SII and PLR were elevated in loVF. At the second visit after 17+/-4 weeks, when patients had no detectable HCV DNA in the peripheral blood, most indices improved significantly across groups. Conclusions: HCV infection affects laboratory profiles depending on gender and viremia levels. Non-invasive indices from routine tests offer valuable insights into inflammatory and nutritional status. Using these indices alongside traditional markers may aid hypothesis generation or clinical assessment and help prioritize further assessment for HCV patients."
41303672,Integrated Transcriptomic Analysis of S100A8/A9 as a Key Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Sepsis Pathogenesis and AI Drug Repurposing.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition driven by a dysregulated immune response, leading to systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure. Among the key molecular regulators, S100A8/A9 has emerged as a critical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, amplifying pro-inflammatory signaling via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways. Elevated S100A8/A9 levels correlate with disease severity, making it a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. To unravel the role of S100A8/A9 in sepsis, we integrate scRNA-seq and RNA-seq approaches. scRNA-seq enables cell-type-specific resolution of immune responses, uncovering cellular heterogeneity, state transitions, and inflammatory pathways at the single-cell level. In contrast, RNA-seq provides a comprehensive view of global transcriptomic alterations, allowing robust statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes. The integration of both approaches enables precise deconvolution of immune cell contributions, validation of cell-specific markers, and identification of potential therapeutic targets. Our findings highlight the S100A8/A9-driven inflammatory cascade, its impact on immune cell interactions, and its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in sepsis. Eight protein targets resulted from the integrative transcriptomics studies (corresponding to S100A8, S100A9, S100A6, NAMPT, FTH1, B2M, KLF6 and SRGN) have been used to predict interaction affinities with 2958 ChEMBL approved drugs, by using a pre-trained AI models (PLAPT) in order to point directions on drug repurposing in sepsis. The strongest predicted interactions have been confirmed with molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis. This study underscores the power of combining high-throughput transcriptomics to advance our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and develop precision medicine strategies."
41303442,"The Endocannabinoid-Microbiota-Neuroimmune Super-System: A Unifying Feedback Architecture for Systems Resilience, Collapse Trajectories, and Precision Feedback Medicine.",2025,"Modern biomedicine frequently contextualizes disease around isolated molecular or organ-specific mechanisms, but numerous chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, diabetes, and sepsis, share common trajectories of systemic destabilization. An increasing body of evidence indicates that health is not a property of single organs but the emergent property of interdependent feedback networks linking the microbiome, endocannabinoidome, neuroimmune system, and metabolic regulators. We propose the Endocannabinoid-Microbiota-Neuroimmune Super-System (EMN-S) as an evolutionarily conserved conceptual model that describes how these fields of influence reciprocally interact through feedback control. The microbial communities constituting the EMN-S encode environmental and dietary inputs, endocannabinoid signaling serves as an integrative regulator that synchronizes neural and immune activity, and neuroimmune circuits effectuate adaptive behaviors that alter microbiotal and lipid ecosystems. This review formalizes the EMN-S, contending that it is a unitary and cohesive model of physiological resilience, as well as offering a framework for precision feedback therapeutics. We describe how three mechanisms-encoder drift, integrator detuning, and executor overutilization-convert stabilizing negative feedback into runaway feedback cascades that underlie chronic, recurrent, and multisystemic disease. We then specify the EMN-S signature-integrated microbiome, lipidomic, and immune readouts-as an early indicator of resilience collapse and prospective preclinical state. Finally, we recapitulate the potential of AI-driven digital twins to illuminate feedback collapse, predict tipping points, and direct closed-loop intervention and treatments to restore dynamic equilibrium. By anchoring complexity in concrete and measurable feedback principles, the EMN-S shifts focus to investigate pathophysiology as opposed to reductionist lesion models of systemic derangements and embraces a systemic, empirically testable theory of stability."
41303181,Association Between the Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-Creatinine Ratio Trajectories and Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients: Insights from MIMIC-IV Database.,2025,"Background: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) accounts for approximately 30% of all stroke cases and has high mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUNCR) is a potential biomarker of catabolic stress in critically ill patients. Meanwhile, its dynamic prognostic value in ICU-admitted HS patients remains unclear. This study utilized Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) to investigate associations between early BUNCR patterns and mortality. Methods: This study was conducted using data from the MIMIC-IV (v2.2) database. HS cases were identified via ICD-9/10. BUNCR trajectories were assessed by applying GBTM during the first 7 days. Outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM) on day 28, on day 90, and at 1 year, with ICU and in-hospital mortality also evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test compared survival across groups. Multivariable Cox proportional models adjusted for confounders and subgroup analysis assessed robustness. Results: Among 2559 patients (52.48% male), mortality was 10.16% (ICU), 14.07% (in-hospital), 17.00% (28-day), 22.43% (90-day), and 36.97% (1-year). Three BUNCR trajectories were identified: Group 1 (upward-downward, n = 655), Group 2 (stable upward, n = 1270), and Group 3 (downward-upward, n = 634). Group 2 had the highest ACM risk at 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year (p < 0.01), and was identified as a significant risk factor in multivariate Cox regression. Subgroup revealed significant interactions of BUNCR trajectories with age and sepsis. Conclusions: Distinct BUNCR trajectories were significantly associated with ACM in critically ill HS patients. Persistently increasing BUNCR predicted the poorest outcomes, underscoring its potential as a dynamic biomarker for timely risk stratification and informed ICU decisions."
41303127,Diagnostic Utility of Monocyte Distribution Width for Early Sepsis Detection in Cancer-Enriched Emergency Cohort.,2025,"Background: Timely recognition of sepsis remains a critical clinical challenge, particularly in cancer patients, who are at higher risk due to immunosuppression. Monocyte distribution width (MDW) has emerged as a biomarker with potential utility in the early detection of sepsis. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 1167 patients who presented to the emergency department of a cancer specialty hospital in Republic of Korea. Patients were classified according to Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 criteria, and the diagnostic performance of MDW was compared with conventional biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on malignancy status, leukopenia, and initial signs of infection. Additionally, turnaround times (TATs) were compared among the biomarkers. Results: MDW demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of CRP and PCT for identifying sepsis and infection across both Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 criteria. In the context of diagnosing sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria, MDW yielded the highest area under the curve (0.869), sensitivity (91.0%), and negative predictive value (98%). Notably, in cancer patients, MDW maintained strong diagnostic reliability. It also demonstrated high diagnostic capability in patients with leukopenia or presenting with initial signs of infection. Moreover, the TAT was significantly shorter for MDW (median 59 min) than for CRP (105 min) or PCT (111 min). Conclusions: MDW is a rapid and accessible biomarker with demonstrated value for early sepsis detection in emergency settings. Its balanced diagnostic profile and consistent performance across diverse patient subgroups support its integration into routine clinical workflows, especially as part of multimodal sepsis screening strategies."
41302180,Guiding Antibiotic Therapy with Machine Learning: Real-World Applications of a CDSS in Bacteremia Management.,2025,"Bacteremia is a life-threatening condition contributing significantly to sepsis-related mortality worldwide. With delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy, mortality increases by 20% regardless of antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluated the perceived clinical utility of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) (OneChoice and OneChoice Fusion) among specialist physicians managing bacteremia cases. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 65 unique specialist physicians from multiple medical specialties who were presented with clinical vignettes describing patients with bacteremia and 90 corresponding AI-CDSS recommendations. Participants assessed the perceived helpfulness of AI decision-making, the impact of AI recommendations on their own clinical judgment, and the concordance between AI recommendations and their own clinical judgment, as well as the validity of changing therapy based on CDSS recommendations. The study encompassed a diverse range of bacterial pathogens, with Escherichia coli representing 38.7% of the isolates and 30% being extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Findings show that 97.8% [(95% CI: 92.2-99.7%)] of physicians reported that AI facilitated decision-making and substantial concordance (87.8% [95% CI: 79.2-93.7%; Cohen's kappa = 0.76]) between AI recommendations and physicians' therapeutic recommendations. Stratification by pathogen revealed the highest concordance for Escherichia coli bacteremia (96.6%, 28/29 cases). Implementation analysis revealed a meaningful clinical impact, with 68.9% [(95% CI: 58.3-78.2%)] of cases resulting in AI-guided treatment modifications. These findings indicate that AI-powered CDSSs effectively bridge critical gaps in infectious disease expertise and antimicrobial stewardship, providing clinicians with evidence-based therapeutic recommendations that can be integrated into routine practice to optimize antibiotic selection, particularly in settings with limited access to infectious disease specialists. For optimal clinical integration, we recommend that clinicians utilize AI-CDSS recommendations as an adjunct to clinical judgment rather than a replacement, particularly in complex cases involving immunocompromised hosts or polymicrobial infections. Future research should prioritize prospective clinical trials that evaluate direct patient outcomes to establish evidence of broader clinical effectiveness and applicability across diverse healthcare settings."
41302151,The Predictive Value of Umbilical Cord Interleukin-6: Implications for Neonatal Care-A Narrative Review of Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.,2025,"(1) Background: The assessment of neonatal health and prognosis is one of the most critical areas in pediatric medicine. Intrauterine inflammation and the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) are increasingly recognized as major determinants of neonatal morbidity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), measured in the umbilical cord (UC) blood, has emerged as a promising biomarker, reflecting both intrauterine conditions and early neonatal risk. This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence on the predictive value of umbilical cord blood IL-6 for neonatal outcome, including sepsis, respiratory distress, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and mortality. (2) Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies reporting umbilical cord IL-6 levels in relation to neonatal outcomes were analyzed and summarized narratively. (3) Results: Evidence consistently indicates that elevated umbilical cord IL-6 is associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and respiratory complications, and provides prognostic insight into neurological outcomes, even though results are influenced by gestational age (GA), mode of delivery, and the presence of chorioamnionitis. (4) Conclusions: UC IL-6 represents a valuable early biomarker for neonatal risk stratification and supports clinical decision-making. Future research should prioritize assay standardization, reference interval development, and prospective multicenter studies to validate its integration into routine neonatal care."
41302085,Adaptation of Endoluminal Vacuum Therapy via Extra-Luminal Access in the Treatment of a High Pharyngeal Fistula: Technical Feasibility and Outcome.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Perforation of the piriform sinus is a rare but severe clinical event that can lead to cervico-thoracic mediastinitis, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent multidisciplinary intervention. Among its etiologies, accidental ingestion of foreign bodies, including dental prostheses, is uncommon but poses significant risks due to the anatomical vulnerability of the hypopharyngeal structures. METHODS: We report a rare case of right piriform sinus perforation secondary to the ingestion of a dental prosthesis, complicated by cervico-mediastinitis, sepsis, tracheostomy, and sacral pressure ulcer. The clinical course required emergency surgical intervention and intensive supportive care. RESULTS: A novel aspect of this case was the use of the Endoscopic Vacuum-Assisted Closure (EVAC) irrigation system as an adjunctive technique in the management of deep cervical drainage. Rather than approaching the fistula from within the lumen, the team created a controlled external drainage system, adaptation of the vacuum-assisted closure therapy directly over the fistulous tract. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, high clinical suspicion and coordinated management in the treatment of piriform sinus perforations. It also illustrates the potential applicability of modern technologies such as negative pressure irrigation in the complex management of deep neck infections and mediastinitis."
41301983,Novel Neutrophilic Parameters of the Sysmex XN-1000V for the Prediction of Inflammation in Dogs.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a common reason for dogs to present to veterinary clinics. Early diagnosis of systemic inflammation is important. Acute phase proteins, like C-reactive protein, are useful but not specific to infection. In human medicine, the intensive care infection score (ICIS) offers a faster, cost-effective alternative using advanced hematological parameters. While ICIS is not available for veterinary use, some components (e.g., neutrophil side fluorescent light) can be measured using analyzers like the Sysmex XN-1000V. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to establish a control group of healthy dogs for the novel parameters neutrophil side fluorescent light (NE-SFL), neutrophil side scattered light (NE-SSC), and neutrophil forward scattered light (NE-FSC) and assess their utility in detecting inflammation in diseases such as sepsis, pyometra, steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis (SRMA), and idiopathic epilepsy. METHODS & RESULTS: Value ranges were calculated based on 21 healthy dogs. Compared to controls, NE-SFL levels were significantly elevated in sepsis, pyometra, and SRMA, while NE-SSC was only elevated in sepsis and pyometra and NE-FSC only in sepsis. No increases were observed in idiopathic epilepsy. Manual gating of the white blood cell differential scattergram was necessary in samples showing high neutrophil toxicity and the presence of bands. CONCLUSION: NE-SFL and NE-SSC, obtainable from routine complete blood count, may serve as novel, accessible markers for inflammation in dogs. Further research is needed to validate their broader diagnostic use."
41301767,"Calprotectin, Azurocidin, and Interleukin-8: Neutrophil Signatures with Diagnostic and Prognostic Value in Sepsis.",2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and limited-resource countries. Despite over a century of research, accurate biomarkers for reliable diagnosis and prognosis in critically ill patients have yet to be established. Methods: This multicenter retrospective observational study aims to evaluate serum levels of Calprotectin, Azurocidin, cytokines, chemokines, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in 15 healthy volunteers (controls), 15 non-infectious SIRS patients, 92 alive septic patients (Sepsis_A) and 29 dead septic patients (Sepsis_D). Results: Most biomarkers showed significantly higher serum concentrations in septic patients compared with controls, with IL-4 being increased only in the Sepsis_D group. In addition, several markers, including Calprotectin, Azurocidin, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-35, were progressively elevated from SIRS to Sepsis_A and Sepsis_D cohorts, reflecting disease severity. All biomarkers showed good diagnostic performance for predicting Gram-negative bacteremia, although their accuracy in discriminating survivors from non-survivors was relatively low. Conclusions: In conclusion, calprotectin, azurocidin, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-35 may assist clinicians in identifying Gram-negative bacteremia in septic patients; however, their prognostic value appears to be limited."
41301751,"Early Diagnostic Markers and Risk Stratification in Sepsis: Prognostic Value of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, Platelets, and the Carmeli Score.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, where immune-inflammatory and thrombo-inflammation drive organ dysfunction. Early recognition of high-risk patients is essential. In addition, the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens complicates therapeutic strategies, as delays in appropriate antimicrobial therapy are strongly associated with poor outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study including 120 critically ill patients fulfilling Sepsis-3 criteria. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 48 h, and 72 h. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated from complete blood counts. At the same time, the Carmeli score was used as a surrogate for MDR infection risk. Prognostic accuracy was assessed using ROC curve analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Persistently elevated NLR at 72 h and a delayed decline in platelet counts were associated with higher mortality. NLR at 72 h showed good predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.765; 95% CI 0.668-0.863), and the combination of APACHE II and NLR improved prognostic performance (AUC = 0.827). Importantly, the Carmeli score, reflecting MDR infection risk, was an independent predictor of outcome, linking antimicrobial resistance risk with sepsis prognosis. Conclusions: Dynamic immune-inflammatory biomarkers (NLR, platelets), when integrated with MDR risk assessment through the Carmeli score, provide a simple and cost-effective strategy for early prognostic stratification in sepsis. This combined approach may help facilitate early therapeutic decisions and patient care triage."
41301539,Circulating microRNAs and Plasma Gelsolin as Biomarkers of Sepsis: Molecular Insights and Prospects for Precision Medicine.,2025,"Sepsis is a major medical emergency, characterized by a dysfunctional immune response to infection, which often progresses to multiple organ failure and death. Early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation present significant challenges due to limitations in the specificity and sensitivity of traditional biomarkers. This narrative review summarizes recent evidence on the potential of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-150, miR-146a, miR-223, miR-155, miR-122, and miR-4772-5p and plasma gelsolin (pGSN) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in sepsis. We discuss mechanisms involved and their potential for integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in personalized medicine. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature. Original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses focused on the diagnostic or prognostic value of circulating miRNAs or pGSN in sepsis were included; opinion papers and case reports were excluded. Altered expression of certain circulating microRNAs correlates with disease severity and mortality. Among circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-122 and miR-150 have become the most consistently validated biomarkers in clinical studies, associated with sepsis severity and death rates. Additionally, other miRNAs such as miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 play roles in modulating immune and endothelial responses, highlighting the complex regulation of sepsis pathophysiology. Low pGSN concentrations at admission are associated with severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and serve as an independent predictor of mortality. Preclinical studies suggest that supplementation with exogenous pGSN could increase survival. AI algorithms show promising results for early sepsis detection and optimization of therapeutic decisions. However, combining circulating miRNAs and plasma gelsolin (pGSN) into AI-based models is still an exploratory idea that needs prospective validation, assay standardization, and multicenter studies before it can be used clinically."
41301165,Enhancing Clinical Decision-Making in Pediatric Monitoring: Learning Threshold Alarm Patterns to Predict Critical Illness.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Patient monitors assist caregivers in identifying deterioration earlier by using threshold alarms. Not all of the threshold alarms necessitate immediate action, but some are a result of the triggering of a physiological event. We aim to use pattern recognition techniques to identify threshold alarm signal patterns before the onset of critical illness, thereby enabling the faster and more effective detection of clinical deterioration and supporting better clinical decision-making. METHOD: Secondary data from 774 pediatric patients were extracted from the IMPALA Project conducted in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at Queen Elizabeth and Zomba Central Hospitals in Malawi. The threshold alarm data were generated from the vital signs using WHO age cut-offs and GOAL3 age cut-offs. Time-segmented alarm analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of threshold alarms around each vital sign 8 h before the onset of critical illness events. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) was used to generate threshold alarm signal patterns for each signal per individual before the onset of a critical illness event. We used three machine learning approaches, random forest, support vector machine, and decision tree, to learn threshold alarm patterns in signals preceding critical illness events. RESULTS: The total threshold alarm summed up to (3,910,083) in total for WHO and (2,041,740) for GOAL3. Temporal distributions of ECGRR, ECGHR and oxygen saturation rate (SPO2) threshold alarms were observed, revealing patterns before the onset of the critical illness events. A pattern of most threshold alarms was distributed around (40-60) for ECGRR upper threshold alarms and (0-20) for ECGRR lower threshold alarms, (80-85) for ECGHR lower threshold alarms and (140-160) for ECGHR upper threshold alarms, and (85-90) for SPO2 for death (CPR and PICU), around WHO threshold alarms. For sepsis, most of these threshold alarms were distributed around (40-50) of ECGRR upper threshold alarms and (0-20) for ECGRR lower threshold alarms, (150-180) for ECGHR upper threshold alarms, and (85) for SPO2 for WHO threshold alarms, and most of the threshold alarms had a duration of less than 30 s. The results indicate that the random forest classifier performed better in learning the threshold patterns, with an accuracy of 93% and an area under the curve of 92, compared to using the support vector machine learning model and decision tree, which had an accuracy from a classification report of 85% and 94%, with low death and sepsis precision, recall, and F1-Score. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of threshold alarm data before critical illness events has provided valuable insights into threshold alarm patterns associated with death and sepsis. The data revealed distinct patterns in ECGRR, ECGHR, and SPO2 signals, and most of the threshold alarms were in the lower duration. The random forest classifier effectively distinguished these learned patterns around death and sepsis events compared to other algorithms. Further studies are required on the use of algorithms on all vital sign signal features in clinical settings."
41300951,The Interleukin Network in Sepsis: From Cytokine Storm to Clinical Applications.,2025,"Background and Objectives: Despite major advances in medical science and critical care, sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide: it arises from dysregulated host response to infections and may culminate in organ dysfunction. A hallmark of its pathogenesis is the cytokine storm, in which interleukins (ILs) serve as central mediators of both protective and deleterious immune responses. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of ILs in sepsis, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Material and Methods: We analyzed recent clinical and experimental studies focusing on the most studied ILs-including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-17-in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Attention was given to mechanistic insights, prognostic significance, and therapeutic strategies targeting IL pathways. Results: IL-1 and IL-6 emerged as key pro-inflammatory mediators, amplifying vascular permeability, coagulation activation, and shock, with IL-6 validated as a robust prognostic biomarker. IL-10 was identified as a pivotal anti-inflammatory cytokine, limiting tissue injury but fostering immunosuppression and secondary infections. Other ILs, such as IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-17, contributed to neutrophil recruitment, Th1/Th17 activation, organ-specific injury, and sepsis susceptibility. Therapeutic interventions targeting ILs, including the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab, have shown promise in selected patient subgroups. Conclusions: ILs are central to the immunopathology of sepsis, acting both as drivers of hyperinflammation and mediators of immunosuppression. Their dual role underscores the relevance of ILs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as context-dependent therapeutic targets. Future approaches should prioritize precision immunomodulation aligned with the principles of personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes in sepsis."
41300910,Research Progress on Sepsis Diagnosis and Monitoring Based on Omics Technologies: A Review.,2025,"Sepsis poses a significant global health burden, with millions of cases and high mortality rates annually, largely due to challenges in early diagnosis and monitoring. Traditional methods, reliant on nonspecific clinical manifestations and limited biomarkers like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, often fail to distinguish infection from non-infectious inflammation or capture disease heterogeneity. This review synthesizes recent progress in omics technologies-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-for advancing sepsis management. Genomics, via metagenomic next-generation sequencing, enables rapid pathogen identification and genetic variant analysis for susceptibility and prognosis. Transcriptomics reveals molecular subtypes and immune dynamics through RNA sequencing and single-cell approaches. Proteomics and metabolomics uncover protein and metabolite profiles linked to immune imbalance, organ damage, and metabolic disorders. Multi-omics integration, enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning, facilitates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and predictive modeling, bridging laboratory findings to bedside applications like rapid diagnostic tools and clinical decision support systems. Despite advancements, challenges including data heterogeneity, high costs, and ethical concerns persist. Future directions emphasize single-cell and spatial omics, AI-driven personalization, and ethical frameworks to transform sepsis care from reactive to proactive, ultimately improving outcomes."
41300689,MicroRNA Profiling as a Novel Tool in the Diagnostics of Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Scoping Review.,2025,"Background/Objectives: The incidence of late-onset sepsis (LOS) has increased with improved survival rates in premature infants. Blood culture, the diagnostic ""gold standard"", requires at least 36-72 h for results, leading to empiric antibiotic use and potential resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for sepsis in adults, but their role in neonatal LOS remains unclear. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the miRNA expression profiles of bacterial LOS in neonates. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was performed between 1 November 2023 and 31 December 2024. Results: Twelve studies fulfilled our criteria and were included in the review. Despite the considerable heterogeneity among the studies, most focused on detecting and quantifying serum microRNAs using real-time PCR, while some examined correlations with other biomarkers, such as CRP. The few microRNAs identified as common across multiple studies showed similar patterns of regulation in LOS cases. Compared to controls (no LOS), neonates with LOS exhibited significant alterations in miRNA expression. More precisely, in LOS, miRNA-181a, miRNA-23b, miRNA-181b5p, miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-34a5p, miRNA-199a3p, miRNA-1184 and miRNA-1295p were downregulated, while miRNA-16, miRNA-146a, miRNA-101, miRNA-187, miRNA-21, miRNA-15a/16 and miRNA-455-5p were upregulated. Conclusions: Currently, there is limited data regarding miRNA expression in LOS. Many studies showed altered expression of specific miRNAs in septic neonates; however, these observations need further validation in larger cohorts and/or randomized controlled trials to confirm their diagnostic potential."
41299676,ICOSL: more than a trigger of ICOS function.,2025,"Inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) and its ligand ICOSL are members of the CD28 and B7 receptor families that play central roles in immune regulation. While the role of ICOS in T-cell activation and differentiation has been widely studied, increasing evidence indicates that ICOSL, which is broadly expressed across both immune and nonimmune cell types, also functions as a signaling receptor. This review focuses on ICOSL-mediated reverse signaling and its ability to modulate the behavior of ICOSL-expressing immune and stromal cells. In vitro, ICOSL activation induces cell type-specific responses, most notably regulating cell migration. In vivo, ICOSL signaling influences key processes such as tumor growth, bone remodeling, wound healing, liver regeneration, and sepsis. Taken together, these findings expand the conventional view of ICOSL as a passive ligand and suggest that ICOSL is a versatile immune modulator with therapeutic relevance in cancer, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases."
41299607,Cefazolin-induced coagulopathy: a case report.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: We report a case of cefazolin-induced coagulopathy, highlighting the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for this rare adverse effect of cefazolin. SETTING: Department of intensive care, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon Hospital, Petach Tikvah, Israel. PATIENT: A patient presented with shortness of breath, pleural effusion, iatrogenic pneumothorax, and bacteremia (positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus). INTERVENTIONS: Multiple thoracic drains and high-dose cefazolin therapy (2 gr intravenously three times per day). CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of mild renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and morbid obesity was admitted to the Emergency Medicine Ward with new-onset shortness of breath. Initial evaluation revealed pleural effusion and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Consequently, high-dose intravenous cefazolin (2 gr three times per day) was initiated. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated, necessitating mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. Management included echocardiography, placement of three pleural drains to address pneumothoraces, and intravenous antibiotic therapy. On the fourth day of cefazolin treatment, the patient experienced a significant rise in international normalized ratio (inr = 20 at day 4) levels, reaching 15-20, despite the absence of overt bleeding. After ruling-out primary hematologic disorders, cefazolin-induced coagulopathy was suspected. Cefazolin was discontinued, and vitamin K supplementation was promptly administered. This intervention led to a rapid normalization of international normalized ratio levels. CONCLUSION: Cefazolin-induced coagulopathy is a potentially life-threatening complication that may present with or without overt bleeding a few days after initiating intravenous cefazolin therapy. Owing to its rarity, this adverse effect requires heightened awareness and familiarity with predisposing risk factors to ensure timely recognition and management."
41299319,Association between serum uric acid to serum creatinine ratio and in-hospital mortality in patients with severe acute pancreatitis: a retrospective study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Serum uric acid/creatinine (SUA/Cr) can reflect the metabolic status of the body. However, the effect of SUA/Cr on the prognosis of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SUA/Cr on in-hospital mortality in SAP patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective study involving 224 SAP patients admitted to the ICU of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from January 2020 to April 2024. The primary outcome for patient inclusion was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome include acute kidney injury (AKI), liver dysfunction, sepsis, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, bacteremia, septicemia, respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), etc. The data on serum uric acid and serum creatinine were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 software. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to determine the cutoff value of SUA/Cr. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between SUA/Cr and in-hospital mortality in SAP patients. RESULTS: A total of the 224 SAP patients included in the study, 88 (39.3%) had low SUA/Cr, while 136 (61.7%) had high SUA/Cr. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in survival, AKI, sepsis, septic shock, septicemia, MODS, ICU days, and length of hospital stay (P < 0.001). Models I, II and III of in-hospital mortality in SAP patients adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), sex, diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, respectively. The results of model I showed that the OR of SUA was 1.002 (P = 0.601), and SCR was 1.009 (P = 0.027). In Model II, compared with the high SUA/Cr group, the OR of the low group was 8.027 (95%CI:1.447-14.511, P = 0.017). In Model III, SUA/Cr OR was 0.456 (95%CI: 0.239-0.872, P = 0.018). Meanwhile, age, BMI, APACHE-II scores, and mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for death in SAP patients. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that SAP patients in the low SUA/Cr group have worse prognosis and higher in-hospital mortality, and low SUA/Cr is independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. SUA/Cr may serve as a prognostic biomarker for SAP patients."
41299314,"Clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and outcomes of Corynebacterium bacteremia: a 15-year retrospective study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium species are often regarded as blood culture contaminants, but they are increasingly recognized as true pathogens. However, their clinical significance, resistance patterns, and prognostic factors remain poorly defined. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and factors associated with true bacteremia compared with isolates considered contaminants, as well as all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a 15-year retrospective cohort study of adults with at least one Corynebacterium-positive blood culture at a tertiary-care university hospital in southern Thailand (2009-2024). Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS from 2017 onward. True bacteremia was defined by clinical and microbiologic criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of true bacteremia, and Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Among the 437 patients, 192 (44%) were classified as having true bacteremia. Independent predictors included hematologic malignancy (aOR 3.75; 95% CI: 1.40-10.73), central venous catheter use (aOR 2.39; 95% CI: 1.49-3.84), non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (aOR 2.83; 95% CI: 1.11-7.66), and hypertension (aOR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.20-3.08). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was significantly greater in true bacteremia patients (43.8% vs. 23.3%, p < 0.001). In the Cox proportional hazards model, hematologic malignancy (aHR 2.32, 95% CI 1.35-4.00) and central venous catheter use (aHR 2.34, 95% CI 1.46-3.74) were identified as independent predictors of 30-day mortality. C. striatum was the most common species (29.5%), highly resistant to penicillin (96.7%) and clindamycin (98.4%), but universally susceptible to vancomycin CONCLUSION: Nearly half of Corynebacterium-positive blood cultures represented true infections with high mortality. Vancomycin remains the most reliable empiric therapy. Species-level identification and susceptibility testing are essential for accurate diagnosis and management CLINICAL TRIAL: Not applicable."
41299255,Differential protein expression and enriched pathways in pediatric sepsis: identification of novel brain-associated biomarkers revealed through proteomic profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, defined by confirmed or suspected infection with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, requires robust biomarker identification. Proteomics enables protein quantification and expression analysis across disease states. This study investigated differential protein expression patterns, particularly brain-associated proteins, between sepsis patients and healthy controls, while evaluating temporal variations and relevant molecular pathways. METHODS: Study participants were prospectively enrolled based on established pediatric sepsis criteria with clinical and blood samples collected. Plasma protein concentrations were quantified using Nucleic Acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay methodology. Statistical analyses incorporated conventional statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. RESULTS: The study cohorts comprised 23 age- and sex-matched participants: pediatric sepsis patients (median 11 years, IQR 9.5-14) and healthy controls (median 11 years, IQR 7.8-13; P = 0.809). Analyses revealed 59 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) on Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Day 1 (PICU D1). Random Forest Classification (RFC) with Boruta feature selection identified 29 proteins that facilitated distinct group stratification. Comparison between PICU D1 and D3 samples yielded 34 DEPs, with RFC and Boruta feature selection isolating 9 discriminatory proteins. Multiple proteins were correlated with PELOD-2 scores and mortality (P < 0.05). Novel brain-associated proteins demonstrated significant differential expression patterns between PICU D1 and healthy controls, and over 3 days of PICU stay in sepsis patients. PICU D1 samples demonstrated significant pathway upregulation when compared to healthy controls, including ""Signaling by Interleukins"", ""Cytokine Signaling in Immune system"", and ""Interleukin-10 signaling"". By PICU D3, pathways associated with ""Generic Transcription Pathway"", ""RNA Polymerase II Transcription"", and ""Gene expression (Transcription)"" exhibited significant downregulation. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed TNF and IL1B as critical bridging proteins linking inflammatory and neurological processes. Disease enrichment analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of respiratory pathology-associated genes, with respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome as the most enriched categories. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation revealed distinct proteomic signatures in inflammatory and transcriptional pathways, including brain-associated processes, that differentiated pediatric sepsis patients from healthy control participants and exhibited temporal dynamics. The identification of TNF and IL1B as bridging proteins between systemic inflammation and neurological processes, combined with respiratory-centric disease enrichment patterns, provides mechanistic insights into sepsis pathophysiology. These alterations may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated encephalopathy and lingering cognitive impairment in sepsis survivors, warranting further investigation in future studies. The identified molecular signatures present potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pediatric sepsis management.

41299237,Prognostic value of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been utilized as a prognostic indicator for sepsis patients; however, the findings have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis seeks to elucidate the prognostic significance of MCP-1 in individuals diagnosed with sepsis. METHODS: We systematically queried four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) to identify studies published from the establishment of the databases until January 2025. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were employed to evaluate the prognostic significance of MCP-1 in this patient population. In our study, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was evaluated for quality assessment, and Funnel plot was used for publication offset. RESULTS: A total of 592 patients from eight studies were included in the evaluation. The findings revealed that MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to those who survived [SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.25-0.82, P = 0.0002]. Our study demonstrated that elevated levels of MCP-1 were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with sepsis, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-1.48; P < 0.00001) using a random-effects model. The funnel plot indicated no publication bias. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that elevated levels of MCP-1 could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator in sepsis patients, however, this conclusion still requires validation through higher-quality studies with longer-term follow-up."
41299099,"Development and Validation of a Diagnostic Prediction Model for Neonatal Sepsis in a Low-Resource Setting, Ethiopia.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of preventable neonatal mortality globally, yet diagnosis remains difficult in low-resource settings due to the inaccessibility and the long turnaround time of blood culture. Clinical prediction models can support the early detection and management of sepsis. OBJECTIVE: To develop and internally validate a diagnostic prediction model for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in a low-resource setting, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2022 to December 2024. We collected data through medical record review among 607 newborns with suspected sepsis. Predictors were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and then subjected to multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed to assess the model's internal validity, and clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis. External validation was not performed. The R statistical software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of sepsis was 36.1% (95% CI: 32.3, 39.9). The final model incorporated maternal anemia, fever, antibiotic use during pregnancy, temperature abnormality, presence of a focus of infection, invasive procedure before admission, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.87(95% CI: 0.84, 0.90) and good calibration. The model achieved a sensitivity of 86.8%, specificity of 71.1%, negative predictive value of 90.5%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.0. The decision curve analysis showed a higher net benefit than the ""treat-all"" or ""treat-none"" strategies. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a diagnostic prediction model for neonatal sepsis, demonstrating good discrimination, high sensitivity, and negative predictive value, with a modest positive likelihood ratio, reflecting its utility for ruling in or out sepsis. The model can be incorporated into routine neonatal care practices and quality improvement initiatives following external validation."
41298591,Inflammatory response in bacteremia survivors and non-survivors: a case-control study.,2025,"Survival in bacteremia is influenced by host comorbidities, pathogen virulence, immune response, and the quality of medical care. A deeper understanding of host inflammatory responses may help identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes. In this study, we analyzed plasma samples from adult patients with bacteremia who presented to the emergency department. Patients who died within seven days (n = 44) were compared to matched survivors (n = 44) who lived at least 90 days, with matching based on age, sex, and causative bacterium. Relative concentrations of 92 inflammation-related plasma proteins were measured using the proximity extension assay (Olink Proteomics AB). Of these, 82 proteins were successfully quantified. Thirty proteins, including IL-20RA, CD40, and HGF, were significantly elevated in non-survivors, while three proteins-IFNG, Flt3L, and TNFB-were significantly reduced. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed activation of multiple proinflammatory signaling cascades in non-survivors, particularly those involving IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17. Logistic regression identified HGF, IL-17 C, and Flt3L as key discriminative proteins between groups. These findings indicate that the host inflammatory profile in bacteremia differs markedly between survivors and early non-survivors. Our results highlight potential diagnostic biomarkers for identifying high-risk patients and point to promising therapeutic targets in the management of bacteremia."
41297582,Beyond hyponatremia: The crucial role of hypernatremia and hypokalemia in pediatric intussusception surgical outcomes.,2025,"BACKGROUND: While hyponatremia is a recognized marker of disease severity in certain pediatric gastrointestinal conditions, the prognostic value of serum potassium and a comprehensive assessment of electrolyte imbalances in intussusception outcomes remain limited. We aimed to quantify the association between dysnatremia and dyskalemia at presentation and major surgical complications in children with intussusception. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study utilized de-identified data from the TriNetX Global Research Network, covering over 150 healthcare organizations. We included 11,111 pediatric patients (</=18 years) with intussusception who had baseline serum sodium and potassium levels documented within one day of diagnosis. We evaluated a gradient of surgical outcomes-open reduction (C1), bowel perforation or resection (C2), and peritonitis or sepsis (C3)-using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age group (0-3 vs. 3-18 years) and sex. RESULTS: Electrolyte disturbances were prevalent: hyponatremia (9.3 %), hypernatremia (1.8 %), hypokalemia (4.7 %), and hyperkalemia (2.8 %). Surgical complication rates were significantly higher in abnormal groups (e.g., 6.2 % for normonatremia vs. 42.2 % for hypernatremia). After adjustment, hypernatremia demonstrated the most potent association across all outcomes, especially with C3 (aHR 7.89; 95 % CI: 4.41-14.10) and C2 (aHR 6.65; 95 % CI: 3.82-11.58). Hypokalemia was also strongly and independently associated with C3 (aHR 4.20) and C2 (aHR 2.69). Hyponatremia was independently associated with all three surgical outcomes with more modest effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypernatremia and hypokalemia, are crucial and objective early indicators of surgical risk in pediatric intussusception. Routine assessment of serum sodium and potassium at presentation can support timely triage and inform operative decision-making."
41297233,Discriminative power of organ-specific SOFA assessment in burn sepsis: A temporal biomarker analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Severe burn patients face diagnostic challenges in distinguishing sepsis from systemic inflammation using Sepsis-3 criteria. Current Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) validation studies focus on composite scores, neglecting subsystem-level analysis in burn-specific pathophysiology. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 55 severe burn patients (TBSA>30 %) from a Chinese burn center (2021-2022), comparing 19 sepsis cases with 36 controls. We analyzed SOFA subsystems and biomarkers (creatinine, platelet count, NT-proBNP, and PCT) during both the early phase (days 1 and 3 post-burn) and the late phase (after day 3 post-burn), performed TBSA-adjusted logistic regression, and constructed a nomogram. RESULTS: Cardiovascular (84.2 % vs 2.8 %, p < 0.001), renal (31.6 % vs 0 %, p < 0.001), and coagulation (42.1 % vs 5.6 %, p < 0.001) subsystems showed superior diagnostic specificity. Platelet trajectories revealed critical divergence at day 3 (septic: 66 vs control: 120 x10(9)/L, p < 0.001), while creatinine elevation persisted across phases (day 1: 100 vs 62 mumol/L, p < 0.001, day 3: 84 vs 65 mumol/L, and late phase: 118 vs 58mumol/L, p < 0.001). PCT demonstrated isolated diagnostic utility confined to the late phase (6.12 vs 0.55 mug/L, p < 0.001). Day 3 platelet count, late-phase creatinine, and PCT were incorporated into the nomogram, which achieved an AUC of 0.930 in ROC analysis. CONCLUSION: Subsystem-specific SOFA analysis identifies creatinine elevation and thrombocytopenia as key sepsis indicators in burns. Serial platelet and creatinine monitoring from day 3 post-injury enhances early detection, while PCT demonstrates diagnostic utility only in the late phase. A clinically applicable nomogram was developed to predict sepsis risk. These findings suggest that these specific organ systems are the principal contributors to the SOFA score in burn-related sepsis."
41297074,The effect of milrinone on short- and mid-term outcomes in patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury: A propensity score matched retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury is a significant contributor to adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The impact of milrinone on the prognosis of patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury remains limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate whether milrinone treatment improves short- and mid-term prognoses in patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the MIMIC-IV version 3.1 database, involving 94,458 ICU admissions. Among these, 41,295 were diagnosed with sepsis according to Sepsis-3 criteria, leading to the identification of 22,376 patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury. We established 565 matched pairs of milrinone and non-milrinone users through 1:1 propensity score matching based on demographics, organ function status, and laboratory indicators. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to visualize survival distributions, and log-rank tests were performed to compare group survival. The primary outcomes were the 90-day and 365-day survival rates. RESULTS: Before matching, the 90-day survival rates were 67.5% for the milrinone group versus 72.1% for the non-milrinone group (p = 0.078). The 365-day survival rates were 62.0% vs. 58.4% (p = 0.092). After matching, the 90-day survival rates were 71.3% vs. 72.2% (p = 0.801), while the 365-day rates were 66.7% vs. 59.7% (p = 0.013). Notably, milrinone benefited patients aged >/=65 and those with specific risk factors, with low-dose milrinone showing higher survival rates (70.0% vs 62.4%, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone treatment may improve long-term survival rates in patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury. Future research should focus on refining treatment protocols and tailoring therapeutic approaches based on individual patient characteristics."
41296831,A rapid time-resolved host gene expression signature predicts responses to antibiotic treatment in neonatal bacterial sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates yet remains difficult to diagnose. This leads to widespread empiric antibiotic therapy, which can facilitate the development of antimicrobial resistance. How the dysregulated host response to infection and sepsis evolves after antibiotic treatment is poorly understood. Temporal gene expression in neonates with microbiologically confirmed sepsis, treated with the antibiotic vancomycin as part of a randomized controlled trial, was profiled to reveal a treatment-responsive gene signature. The signature exhibited a rapid reversal of the septic state, observable within 24 hours of the initiation of therapy. Unexpectedly, response rates associated with the adaptive immune system were among the fastest, and these changes were reproduced in both pediatric and adult patients with sepsis, indicating conservation and reversibility of sepsis signatures across the life course. We demonstrated how these treatment-responsive genes could be translated into a prognostic clinical measure, exhibiting strong agreement with clinical assessments. Network modeling of sepsis-responsive genes identified a signature associated with treatment comprising an early transient elevation of antimicrobial defensive genes, suggesting an impaired bactericidal response in neonatal sepsis. These findings suggest that the host response is regulated in sepsis and offer insights into early prognostic approaches for reducing antibiotic overuse."
41296392,Research Progress on Signalling Pathways Related to Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury in Children.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a prevalent and life-threatening complication in critically ill children, contributing to high mortality rates (up to 30%) and long-term renal dysfunction in pediatric intensive care units. This review synthesizes recent advances in the signalling pathways underlying SA-AKI, emphasizing pediatric-specific mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. This review covers inflammatory cascades via TLR/NF-kappaB leading to cytokine storms (IL-6, TNF-alpha); apoptosis and necrosis involving mitochondrial Bcl-2 dysregulation and OLFM4; and emerging processes like pyroptosis (NF-kappaB-mediated), metabolic reprogramming (choline deficiency and Nrf2-mitophagy), and novel routes such as cGAS-STING and TGF-beta signalling. Biomarkers like urinary OLFM4, DKK3, NGAL, and serum suPAR, alanine, and Penkid enable early diagnosis and risk stratification, with models like PERSEVERE-II enhancing prognostic accuracy. Therapeutic strategies include fluid optimization, renal replacement therapies (CRRT, SLED-f), and pathway-targeted interventions such as choline supplementation, oXiris for cytokine removal, Humanin for immunomodulation, and investigational cGAS-STING inhibitors. Despite progress, challenges persist in translating animal models to pediatric trials and addressing heterogeneity. Integrating multi-omics and precision medicine holds promise for improving outcomes, underscoring the need for multicenter studies in children."
41296074,Sepsis and heatstroke: overlapping and distinct mechanisms of systemic inflammation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and heatstroke, although arising from microbial infection or environmental heat exposure, converge upon similar pathophysiological systemic inflammatory responses that include immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial injury, and multiorgan failure. Despite this overlap, important mechanistic differences, especially in the initiating triggers and immune response dynamics, distinguish their clinical manifestations and therapeutic strategies. FINDINGS: Sepsis is initiated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptors, whereas heatstroke stems from the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in response to thermal injury. Both syndromes disrupt mitochondrial integrity, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, an excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the release of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome C, which further amplify inflammation and promote cell death. Leukocytes undergo diverse forms of death-including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis-compounding immune dysfunction. Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation are prevalent in both conditions, driven by endothelial injury, platelet activation, and NET formation, although microbial toxins intensify this response in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This review synthesizes current evidence to delineate the converging and diverging pathways of sepsis and heatstroke, with a focus on mitochondrial injury, immune paralysis, and thromboinflammation. We also explore emerging biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, including mitochondrial stabilizers and modulators of cell death. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms can inform precision medicine strategies and improve outcomes in both syndromes."
41295242,"From Data to Decisions: Harnessing Multi-Agent Systems for Safer, Smarter, and More Personalized Perioperative Care.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied across the perioperative continuum, with potential benefits in efficiency, personalization, and patient safety. Unfortunately, most such tools are developed in isolation, limiting their clinical utility. Multi-Agent Systems for Healthcare (MASH), in which autonomous AI agents coordinate tasks across multiple domains, may provide the necessary framework for integrated perioperative care. This critical review synthesizes current AI applications in anesthesiology and considers their integration within a MASH architecture. This is the first review to advance MASH as a conceptual and practical framework for anesthesiology, uniquely contributing to the AI discourse by proposing its potential to unify isolated innovations into adaptive and collaborative systems. Methods: A critical review was conducted using PubMed and Google Search to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025. The search strategy combined controlled vocabulary and free-text terms for AI, anesthesiology, perioperative care, critical care, and pain management. Results were filtered for randomized controlled trials and clinical trials. Data were extracted and organized by perioperative phase. Results: The 16 studies (6 from database search, 10 from prior work) included in this review demonstrated AI applications across the perioperative timeline. Preoperatively, predictive models such as POTTER improved surgical risk stratification. Intraoperative trials evaluated systems like SmartPilot and Navigator, enhancing anesthetic dosing and physiologic stability. In critical care, algorithms including NAVOY Sepsis and VentAI supported early detection of sepsis and optimized ventilatory management. In pain medicine, AI assisted with opioid risk assessment and individualized pain-control regimens. While these trials demonstrated clinical utility, most applications remain domain-specific and unconnected from one another. Conclusions: AI has broad potential to improve perioperative care, but its impact depends on coordinated deployment. MASH offers a unifying framework to integrate diverse agents into adaptive networks, enabling more personalized anesthetic care that is safer and more efficient."
41295239,"Identifying Risk Groups in 73,000 Patients with Diabetes Receiving Total Hip Replacement: A Machine Learning Clustering Analysis.",2025,"Background/Objective: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent condition that contributes to adverse outcomes in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study applied machine learning clustering algorithms to identify comorbidity profiles among diabetic THA patients and evaluate their association with postoperative outcomes. Methods: The 2015-2021 National Inpatient Sample was queried using ICD-10 CM/PCS codes to identify DM patients undergoing THA. Forty-nine comorbidities, complications, and clinical covariates were incorporated into clustering analysis. The Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices determined the optimal number of clusters. Multivariate logistic regression assessed risk of non-routine discharge (NRD), and Kruskal-Wallis H testing evaluated length-of-stay (LOS) differences. Results: A total of 73,606 patients were included. Six clusters were identified, ranging from 107 to 61,505 patients. Cluster 6, enriched for urinary tract infection and sepsis, had the highest risk of NRD (OR 7.83, p < 0.001) and the longest median LOS (9.0 days). Clusters 1-4 had shorter recoveries with median LOS of 2.0 days and narrow variability, while Cluster 5 showed intermediate outcomes. Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc testing confirmed significant differences across clusters (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Machine learning clustering of diabetic THA patients revealed six distinct groups with varied comorbidity profiles. Infection-driven clusters carried the highest risk for non-routine discharge and prolonged hospitalization. This approach provides a novel framework for risk stratification and may inform targeted perioperative management strategies."
41294916,Toxic Shock Syndrome in a 45-Year-Old Woman Possibly Associated with Tampon Use: A Case Report of Multiorgan Failure Due to Streptococcus agalactiae.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. However, other streptococcal species, including Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus (GBS)), can also cause TSS, sometimes leading to severe complications, such as multiorgan failure. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who developed TSS associated with tampon use. She presented with fever, chills, hypotension, and leg pain, progressing rapidly to septic shock and multiorgan failure. Blood and urine cultures revealed S. agalactiae group B, while a gynecological examination identified Ureaplasma urealyticum and S. agalactiae. Imaging demonstrated bilateral pneumonic infiltrates and pleural effusion. The patient required intensive care, vasopressor support, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, leading to full clinical recovery. DISCUSSION: Despite advances in tampon design, menstrual TSS remains a significant clinical concern. Early symptoms may be nonspecific, but rapid progression highlights the need for timely recognition and intervention. Although S. agalactiae is an uncommon cause of TSS, it should be considered in relevant clinical scenarios. Prompt empirical antibiotic therapy, followed by targeted treatment based on culture results, along with supportive intensive care, is essential to improve outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Menstrual TSS continues to pose a serious health risk. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in tampon users presenting with fever, rash, and shock. Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality."
41294727,NanoArrayPAD-X: Nanoprobe Array and 3D-microPAD for the Simultaneous Detection of Respiratory Pathogens and Biomarkers at the Point of Care.,2025,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs) are ideal for point-of-care diagnostics due to their low cost, compact size, and ease of use. However, current designs have limited multiplexing capabilities, making it difficult to simultaneously detect pathogens and biomarkers in the same sample. In this work, we introduce NanoArrayPAD-X, a novel microPAD design that combines wax-printed microfluidic networks with an array of nanoprobes for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. This is achieved by distributing the sample through the microfluidic network containing X detection areas. There, targets are captured through physical interactions and recognized by specific antibody-coated nanoprobes released from the nanoprobe array. This generates X dots whose color depends on the concentration of the targets in the sample. A NanoArrayPAD-5 platform capable of detecting five targets was developed to aid in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sensor array could detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and the inflammatory biomarker myeloperoxidase (MPO) with a total turnaround time of 25 min, which is faster than waiting for an overnight culture and the results of an ELISA. Notably, our prototype successfully detected the targets in 87 bronchial aspirate (BAS) specimens, thus demonstrating the suitability of the platform for analyzing complex samples with sputum-like qualities. These findings establish NanoArrayPAD-X as a promising tool for the rapid, multiplexed screening of respiratory pathogens and biomarkers, with potential for guiding personalized antimicrobial therapy in suspected cases of nosocomial pneumonia."
41294166,The difference in hematocrit and albumin levels and the risk of sepsis for patients with acute pancreatitis: a retrospective cohort study based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a major cause of gastrointestinal hospitalization, with an annual global incidence of 3.07%. Severe AP develops in up to 20% of cases, with sepsis occurring in 40-70% of such cases, leading to higher mortality. The early detection of sepsis is crucial. Hematocrit (HCT) and albumin (ALB) levels are individually linked to sepsis. Their combined measure, HCT-ALB, indicates blood and nutritional health. HCT-ALB can predict sepsis and infection outcomes; however, its effectiveness in treating AP-related sepsis has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between HCT-ALB values and sepsis risk in patients with AP. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Medical Information Market for Intensive Care IV database data. The primary outcome was the risk of sepsis in patients with AP. The HCT-ALB value refers to the difference between HCT and ALB levels, which we categorized into three groups according to quantiles: < 0.5, 0.5-7.6, and >/= 7.6. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between HCT-ALB values and sepsis. The predictive value of HCT-ALB was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Subgroup analyses were conducted for different subgroups. RESULTS: Among 565 patients with AP, 163 developed sepsis. In the multivariable model, HCT-ALB >/= 7.60 was associated with sepsis risk for patients with AP [odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-3.14]. The area under the curve (AUC) value of HCT-ALB in predicting sepsis risk among patients with AP was 0.599 (95% CI 0.544-0.654), which was higher than that of the bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis score (AUC 0.558, 95% CI 0.509-0.607). Subgroup analysis showed that HCT-ALB was only related to sepsis risk in male patients with acute kidney injury and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment in < 2 subgroups. CONCLUSION: HCT-ALB values >/= 7.6 were associated with increased sepsis risk in patients with AP. HCTALB may contribute to identifying the risk of sepsis in patients with AP."
41293879,Quantification of Candida spp. using fluorescence and SERS spectroscopy for bloodstream infection diagnosis.,2025,"Bloodstream infections caused by Candida spp. are among the leading hospital-acquired infections, but their diagnosis remains slow and challenging with conventional culture-based methods, which often require days to deliver results. This study aimed to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic strategy for the detection and quantification of Candida spp. directly from blood samples. We designed a workflow combining antibody-modified magnetic beads for pathogen isolation, magnetic SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering)-encoded tags for multiplexed detection, and fluorescence microscopy for rapid prescreening. Data analysis was automated using machine learning, including convolutional neural networks for image classification and self-organizing maps for spectral analysis. This method enabled the detection and quantification of seven clinically relevant Candida species (C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. auris, C. haemulonii, C. dubliniensis, and C. parapsilosis) in 7.5 mL of whole blood at septicemia-relevant concentrations as low as 2 CFU mL(-1), with the results obtained in 4-5 hours. High specificity was demonstrated, with minimal cross-reactivity against bacterial controls. This integrated approach represents a rapid, sensitive, and multiplex alternative to current diagnostics, with the potential to improve the early detection and targeted treatment of candidemia, thereby enhancing the clinical outcomes and reducing the healthcare burden."
41293540,"Serum-soluble SDC1 in septic patients is rich in heparan sulfate, which affects the ELISA quantification values.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Soluble syndecan (sSDC) 1, which is released into the blood by shedding of the SDC1 ectodomain, is a potent biomarker of various inflammatory diseases and cancers. However, the characteristics of serum sSDC1 and methods for its quantification have not been thoroughly investigated. We investigated the properties of sSDC1 in the serum of patients with sepsis and their effects on measurement values. METHODS: Serum sSDC1 levels in patients with and without sepsis were determined using dot blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The molecular characteristics of serum sSDC1 were evaluated using western blotting and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Serum sSDC1 ELISA values were more clearly able to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients than dot blot intensities. Serum sSDC1 mainly exists as the derivatives of the SDC1 ectodomain with molecular masses of 150-200 and 75 kDa, which were more prevalent in septic patients than non-septic patients. The former derivatives showed significant susceptibility to heparinase III. The presence of high-molecular-weight sSDC1 (>200 kDa), immunoprecipitated with an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody, was also characteristic of the serum of patients with sepsis. The 150-200 and 75 kDa forms may have been derived from this high-molecular-weight HS-rich sSDC1. Importantly, the serum sSDC1 ELISA values for patients with sepsis showed a significant increase after treatment with heparinase III. CONCLUSIONS: sSDC1 molecules generated by sepsis-induced pathological shedding may be rich in HS and heterogeneous compared to those generated by physiological shedding. The HS content affected the ELISA quantification values of serum sSDC1."
41293365,Nivolumab-Induced Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in a Patient With Metastatic Melanoma: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2025,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer therapy, particularly in melanoma. However, their immune-enhancing mechanisms can lead to rare but severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a hyperinflammatory syndrome marked by uncontrolled immune activation. HLH is challenging to diagnose due to symptom overlap with sepsis, disease progression, and other irAEs. This study presents a case of steroid-refractory HLH following nivolumab therapy and a literature review of published cases to highlight patterns in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. We conducted a chart review of a 79-year-old male patient with metastatic melanoma who developed HLH after nivolumab therapy at a community hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois. Additionally, a literature review (2018-2024) was performed using PubMed Central to identify HLH cases linked to ICIs. Inclusion criteria required clear reporting of the ICI used, underlying malignancy, time to HLH onset, diagnostic approach, treatment, and clinical outcomes. The patient developed HLH after his second nivolumab dose. Initial immunosuppressive therapy, including dexamethasone, tocilizumab, anakinra, and ruxolitinib, was ineffective. Improvement occurred only after initiating the HLH-2004 protocol with etoposide and adjunctive cyclosporine. His course was complicated by infections and neutropenia, but recovery was achieved after 10 weeks. The literature review included 16 publications. HLH typically develops within 1-6 weeks of ICI initiation, most often with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. While corticosteroids were first-line therapy, escalation to etoposide, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or cytokine inhibitors was common in severe cases. Approximately 70-75% of patients recovered. HLH is a rare but potentially fatal irAE of ICIs. Early recognition and aggressive treatment are essential. Oncology-specific diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines are needed to improve outcomes as immunotherapy use expands."
41293346,Pattern of Independent Factors Influencing Preterm Infants' Chance of Survival to Discharge Without Any Significant Morbidities.,2025,"Background Recognizing the factors that contribute to significant morbidity in preterm infants is essential for effective clinical management and parental counseling. However, current knowledge in this area remains limited. Methods This retrospective single-center study aimed to identify the predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in surviving infants born between 22 and 32 weeks of gestation. Of the 443 infants studied, 269 did not have any of these conditions, while 174 had at least one. Among the latter group, 110 infants had one, and 64 had more than one disease. We conducted group-based comparisons of 33 maternal, intrapartum, and neonatal factors, which helped identify 15 potentially significant predictors. These were included in regression models to identify those that predicted survival without BPD, IVH, and ROP, as well as survival with one or more of these morbidities. The models presented odds ratios (ORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The likelihood of survival without BPD, IVH, and ROP was decreased in infants born with a gestational age of 22-27 weeks (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48, 0.97), who were mechanically ventilated (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35, 0.98), or diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35, 0.79), sepsis (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56, 0.97), or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.22, 0.91), but was increased in the presence of maternal pre-eclampsia (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05, 1.97). The presence of intrapartum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, thrombocytopenia, and NEC predicted the finding of a single morbidity, whereas a gestational age of 22-27 weeks, mechanical ventilation, and thrombocytopenia predicted more than one morbidity in these infants. Conclusion Extreme prematurity, mechanical ventilation, and thrombocytopenia are important factors, and their presence or absence can help distinguish infants who will survive without BPD, IVH, and ROP from those who will have two or three morbidities. Further validation of these findings is necessary before their application in clinical practice."
41293242,Recent advances in understanding oxidative stress in sepsis: pathogenic roles and antioxidant therapeutic prospects - a narrative review.,2025,"Sepsis remains a major global health challenge, exerting a particularly severe toll in low- and middle-income countries. Despite advances in antimicrobial and supportive care, sepsis continues to defy effective control due to its complex pathophysiology and multi-organ involvement. Central to this complexity is a dysregulated host response, driven by hyperinflammation, immune suppression, and profound mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction. A critical mediator of this dysregulation is oxidative stress, which exacerbates cellular injury through reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, disrupting mitochondrial integrity and redox balance. This review synthesizes current insights into the mechanistic interplay between oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunopathology in sepsis. It further evaluates the therapeutic potential of endogenous antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione, as well as exogenous agents including vitamins A, C, E, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, and carnosine. While translational gaps persist, particularly in dosing, timing, and patient stratification, emerging strategies including mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, nanotherapeutics, and biomarker-guided interventions hold promise for restoring redox homeostasis and improving clinical outcomes. This review aims to serve as a contemporary resource for researchers and clinicians striving to decode the oxidative basis of sepsis and accelerate the development of precision antioxidant therapies."
41293058,The accuracy of heparin-binding protein and interleukin-6 in predicting prognosis of severe pneumonia with sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early warning is critical for improving prognosis in patients with severe pneumonia-induced sepsis. Conventional biomarkers and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score have notable limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of serum heparin-binding protein (HBP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), assess their correlation with clinical outcomes, and compare their predictive performance against traditional biomarkers and the SOFA score. METHODS: A total of 171 patients with severe pneumonia complicated by sepsis were enrolled and stratified into survivor (n=96) and non-survivor (n=75) groups based on 28-day mortality. Baseline characteristics, including demographic data, comorbidities, and laboratory markers-HBP, IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate (Lac)-as well as SOFA scores, were collected upon admission. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. Predictive accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with pairwise comparisons of area under the curve (AUC) conducted via DeLong's test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the association between biomarker levels and organ dysfunction severity. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. RESULT: Non-survivors had significantly higher HBP, IL-6, PCT, CRP, Lac, and SOFA scores than survivors (all P<0.05). IL-6 was markedly elevated in blood culture-positive patients (P<0.05), suggesting value in detecting bloodstream infections. Multivariate analysis confirmed HBP (OR = 1.006, 95% CI:1.002-1.011), IL-6 (OR = 1.004, 95% CI:1.001-1.007), and SOFA score (OR = 1.026, 95% CI:1.145-1.484) as independent prognostic factors (all P<0.05). ROC analysis showed IL-6 had the highest AUC (0.80), followed by SOFA (0.78) and HBP (0.73), with no significant AUC differences between IL-6 and SOFA (P = 0.719) or HBP and CRP/PCT (both P>0.05). Optimal cut-offs were 55.90 ng/mL for HBP (sensitivity 82.7%, specificity 53.1%) and 32.62 pg/mL for IL-6 (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 69.8%). HBP correlated strongest with SOFA (r=0.60, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum HBP and IL-6 have comparable predictive efficacy to SOFA score and are numerically superior to PCT, CRP, and Lac. IL-6 also aids early identification of bloodstream infections. However, their cut-offs are from a single-center cohort and require external validation; combined use with SOFA score is recommended clinically."
41292579,Improving Sepsis Mortality Prediction With Machine Learning Using Full Region Synthetic Sampling Approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and remains a leading cause of mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Accurate mortality prediction is crucial for optimizing ICU resource allocation. However, severe class imbalance in ICU datasets hampers the generalization performance of machine learning models. METHODS: This study proposes a Full Region Synthetic Sampling Approach (FRSSA), a novel data augmentation method that dynamically balances the minority class distribution based on regional density. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Tuning (ASST), an optimization-based strategy that adjusts augmentation weights to enhance model performance. To evaluate model fairness and clinical utility, we propose the Balanced Performance Score (BPS), which integrates accuracy, precision, and recall for personalized ICU risk assessment. Also, we compare two augmentation strategies: (1) Pre-Splitting: Augmentation occurs before data set splitting, and (2) Post-Splitting: Augmentation is applied only to the training set to ensure fair evaluation. We utilize publicly available ICU datasets from both the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases and evaluate the performance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models, with hyperparameters optimized using RandomizedSearchCV on the training set. RESULTS: The Pre-Splitting strategy achieved 89.64% accuracy and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.968, but posed a risk of test-set contamination. In contrast, the Post-Splitting strategy yielded 78.31% accuracy and an AUROC of 0.7241, ensuring better real-world generalization. The ASST mechanism optimally balanced 65% interpolation (FRSSA) and 35% expansion (FRSSA), reducing false positive rates and enhancing model fairness. CONCLUSION: FRSSA preserves regional data distribution by generating synthetic samples near the imbalanced regions. ASST dynamically adjusts augmentation ratios to maximize classification performance and generalization. The BPS score-fusion metric offers a flexible evaluation framework, accommodating varying clinical priorities in ICU settings. Our findings demonstrate that Post-Splitting augmentation with FRSSA and ASST produces a fairer and more reliable ICU mortality prediction model."
41291942,TIGRIS and EUPHRATES eventually join and provide new evidence: a narrative review of the polymyxin B hemoperfusion.,2025,"Septic shock driven by endotoxemia is associated with high mortality despite advances in supportive care. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) selectively removes circulating endotoxin and has shown variable efficacy in randomized trials. While earlier studies, such as EUPHAS, suggested benefit, subsequent trials, including ABDO-MIX and EUPHRATES, yielded neutral results, partly due to heterogeneous patient selection. The recently completed TIGRIS trial addressed these limitations by enrolling septic shock patients with intermediate endotoxin activity (EAA: 0.60-0.89) and high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS > 9) using a Bayesian design. In 151 evaluable patients, PMX-HP achieved the primary endpoint, with a 95.3% posterior probability of 28-day survival benefit (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.67; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 6.4%). At 90 days, mortality reduction was greater (ARR: 17.4%; adjusted OR: 0.54; > 99% posterior probability of benefit), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 8.1. These results support the targeted use of PMX-HP in a biomarker-defined subgroup and may facilitate broader regulatory approval."
41291594,Central retinal artery occlusion as a rare complication of trichoderma-associated acute invasive fungal sinusitis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFRS) is a life-threatening infection characterized by fungal hyphen invading the nasal mucosal, blood vessels, and nerves, leading to tissue necrosis. It often complicates intracranial infection with a high mortality rate. Ocular manifestations can indicate intracranial or systemic infection. This article reports a rare case of AIFRS complicated by central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) caused by Trichoderma infection to provide a reference for early diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old male with undiagnosed diabetes presented with left facial numbness, periodontal pain, and progressive vision loss. Initial misdiagnosis of the patient as having facial neuritis delayed anti-fungal therapy. Despite intensive care unit (ICU) admission and surgical debridement, the patient succumbed to sepsis and intracranial infection. Ophthalmic imaging confirmed CRAO, with fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) revealing arterial occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the need for early recognition of AIFRS in high-risk patients and systematic ophthalmic evaluation in cases of rapid vision loss. Multidisciplinary collaboration and cautious use of corticosteroids are critical. International guidelines recommend prompt anti-fungal therapy, but thrombolysis for CRAO remains controversial in systemic fungal infections."
41291529,Factors affecting response to furosemide stress test among critically ill hypoalbuminemic patients with AKI without prior albumin infusion.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition often associated with hypoalbuminemia, which can influence the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of diuretics like furosemide. In critically ill patients, sepsis is the major cause of AKI, accounting for nearly 50% of cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether AKI patients with hypoalbuminemia can respond to FST without albumin supplementation. METHODS: This is a prospective quasi-experimental study. Patients were obtained from the intensive care unit of Cairo University Hospital with AKI stages 1 and 2 with hypoalbuminemia. A bolus of furosemide was administered at a dose calculated to be 1-1.5 mg/kg in a single dose to patients without a prior diagnosis of kidney disease and clinical signs of hypovolemia. RESULTS: A total of 41 critically ill patients with AKI were enrolled, aged between 18 and 80 years, of whom 56.10% had diabetes mellitus, 53.70% were on at least one nephrotoxic medication, and 56.10% had sepsis as the cause of AKI. The median (IQR) albumin level was 1.9 g/dL (1.4-2.7). Among 41 hypoalbuminemic AKI patients included, 80.50% responded to FST without prior albumin infusion. Non-responders had significantly lower baseline serum albumin levels, median (IQR) 1(1-2) vs. 2 (1-3) g/dL, p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: AKI patients with mild-to-moderate hypoalbuminemia may still respond to FST without albumin infusion, although response rates decline with the increasing severity of hypoalbuminemia. The FST remains a valuable predictive tool in hypoalbuminemic AKI patients but warrants further investigation to optimize its utility in this population. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41290778,Serum zinc dynamics as a diagnostic and immunomodulatory biomarker in neonatal sepsis.,2025,"This study aimed to investigate serum zinc levels in term neonates with sepsis, evaluate its correlation with immune parameters, and assess zinc's diagnostic efficacy in identifying neonatal sepsis. A prospective cohort study was conducted, involving two groups: 52 neonates diagnosed with sepsis who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of our hospital between January 2022 and June 2023, and 50 healthy controls matched for gestational age and birth weight. Serum zinc levels, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in both cohorts. No statistically significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between the sepsis group (n = 52) and the healthy controls group (n = 50). Neonates with sepsis exhibited significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to controls (52.6 +/- 17.4 microg/dL vs. 83.2 +/- 21.4 microg/dL, P < 0.05), alongside markedly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], interleukin-10 [IL-10], and interleukin-12 [IL-12]). Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant associations: serum zinc levels showed a strong negative correlation with IL-6 (r = -0.510, P < 0.05) and IL-8 (r = -0.625, P < 0.05), while a positive correlation was observed with IL-12 (r = 0.627, P < 0.05). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated serum zinc's moderate diagnostic utility for neonatal sepsis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.812, P < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 76.9%, respectively. These findings highlight zinc's potential role in sepsis pathophysiology and diagnostic utility, despite its inferior performance compared to CRP (AUC = 0.865, P < 0.0001). Our findings demonstrate an inverse correlation between serum zinc levels and inflammatory response intensity in neonatal sepsis. Zinc deficiency may serve as a diagnostic biomarker, given its significant negative association with pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) and its moderate predictive accuracy for disease detection."
41290495,"Artificial intelligence in neonatal sepsis: Scope, challenges, and potential solutions!",2026,"Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths globally. Despite advances, accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by the limited performance of the current clinical approaches, imperfect laboratory biomarkers, and long turnaround time of blood cultures. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its ability to identify patterns and learn continuously (machine learning), seems promising. Basic steps in model development include data filtration, train: test split, feature selection, choosing appropriate algorithms, and evaluating performance using a reference standard. In neonatal sepsis, the role of AI spans from predicting sepsis and related outcomes to formulating an individualized treatment approach for the neonate. Existing models, largely from high-income countries, report encouraging diagnostic accuracy but face methodological limitations, lack external validation, and remain somewhat distant from bedside application. Additional barriers to their generalizability include lack of uniform definition of sepsis, variations in disease and pathogen profiles in different settings (particularly in developing countries), availability of electronic health data, tweaks in feature selection, and ethical and legal challenges. This review synthesizes current evidence, highlights gaps, and outlines priorities for future research. We call for a collaborative effort from AI and neonatal experts to devise robust, context-specific solutions."
41289621,A review on pathological implications and therapeutic interventions of sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a serious form of acute cerebral dysfunction that is seen in the ICU and is characterised by high mortality and long-term neuropsychiatric disabilities. This condition is not caused by a direct central nervous system infection; instead, it develops through a complex cascade of the systemic inflammatory response involving cytokine release, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Since there are no approved drugs that specifically protect the brain during the development of SAE, natural and synthetic compounds that modulate a variety of target sites offer a highly attractive therapeutic option. This review integrates preclinical findings from rodent models of SAE induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cecal-ligation-and-puncture (CLP) models. The findings suggest that certain plant-derived phytochemicals, along with various investigational agents, have effective neuroprotective activity and target the complex pathophysiology of SAE in a multi-faceted manner. These bioactive compounds efficiently suppress neuroinflammatory responses, the production of reactive species, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and apoptosis of neuronal cells in these experimental models. These data firmly suggest that the multi-target nature of these molecules makes them highly appropriate for the treatment of SAE. Extensive translational research is now required to confirm these promising findings in human septic patient populations."
41289132,Integrated Photoacoustic-Metabolomic Platform for Multimodal Assessment of Sepsis-Induced Brain Dysfunction.,2025,"Sepsis-induced brain dysfunction (SIBD), a critical determinant of mortality and long-term neurological sequelae in sepsis patients. The mechanistic understanding of SIBD has been limited by conventional single-modality approaches, which fail to capture the complex oxygenation-metabolism interplay. Here, we present an integrated photoacoustic-metabolomic platform that combines high-resolution photoacoustic imaging with targeted metabolomics to comprehensively assess cerebral oxygenation and metabolic alterations during sepsis. Our imaging system provides high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling mapping of key parameters, including cerebral oxygen saturation (sO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and the spatial heterogeneity of oxygen metabolism. By integrating these imaging capabilities with region-specific metabolomic profiling, we uncover a dynamic relationship between sepsis-driven oxygenation disruptions and metabolic reprogramming. Specifically, we demonstrate that sepsis induces heterogeneous cortical hypoxia, dysregulated OEF dynamics, and a metabolic shift marked by enhanced glycolysis and suppressed pentose phosphate pathway activity in high-OEF regions. This multimodal platform not only advances our understanding of the pathophysiology of SIBD but also offers a powerful tool for early diagnosis, personalized therapeutic strategies, highlighting the promise in bedside monitoring and precision medicine applications in sepsis management."
41288863,Early diagnosis of bloodstream infections by Neutrophil-Reactive Intensity (NEUT-RI): a retrospective analysis.,2025,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are serious conditions caused by the presence of microorganisms in the blood. Although blood culture remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is time-consuming. Neutrophil activation plays a central role in the early immune response to infection and can be quantified using the Neutrophil-Reactive Intensity (NEUT-RI) parameter, derived from hematological analyzer using the fluorescence flow cytometry technology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate NEUT-RI as an early marker of BSI and compare its diagnostic performance with standard infection biomarkers. We conducted a retrospective study involving 120 inpatients with documented BSI. Each inpatient underwent blood testing for PCT (Procalcitonin), serum CRP (C-Reactive Protein), WBCs (White Blood Cells), neutrophil absolute count within 12 h prior to blood culture sampling. NEUT-RI values were retrieved from the complete blood count. A control group of 52 inpatients with negative blood cultures was also analyzed. Median NEUT-RI was significantly higher in BSI patients than in controls (53.43 FI vs 48.65 FI; p < 0.001). ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis showed an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.785 for NEUT-RI, with 72.5% sensitivity and 76.9% specificity at a cut-off of 50.7 FI. Only Procalcitonin (AUC 0.882) outperformed NEUT-RI (p = 0.01). Our findings suggest that NEUT-RI increases in the early stages of bacteremia and may serve as a useful early indicator of bloodstream infection. NEUT-RI could be integrated into multi-parametric diagnostic algorithms to improve early detection of BSIs. Further studies are warranted to validate these preliminary results."
41288552,"Pediatric Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Admissions and Outcome at Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: The burden, profile, and outcomes of pediatric HIV have not been exhaustively studied in developing countries. The present study hopes to fill some of the research gaps. AIM: This study aimed to document the burden and profile of pediatric HIV admission at Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa. Nigeria, with emphasis on highlighting peculiarities in our setting. METHODS: A retrospective study of case records of all HIV infected children admitted and managed on the pediatric infectious ward over 15 years. The data generated from the records were analyzed, and inferences were made. RESULTS: The total 35 children population studied consisted of 18 (51.4%) boys and 17 (48.6%) girls with a mean age of 4.04 +/- 3.73. Transmission of HIV was vertical in all, whereas diagnosis of HIV infection was made during admission in 31 (88.6%). Tuberculosis, community-acquired pneumonia, severe malaria, Pneumocystis jeroveci pneumonia, and sepsis accounted for more than 70% of admissions. Severe malaria was more common in the above 5 years age group. Candida and scabies were the most common coinfections and infestations, respectively. More than 50% of admissions were complicated by anemia and hypoxemia. A total of six deaths, accounting for 8.6% of the total HIV infected enrolled patients, were recorded. Hypoxemia and AIDS states were significantly associated with death (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Childhood HIV infections are a significant contributor to pediatric infectious morbidity, with high HIV case mortality rates. Vertical HIV transmission rates and age at detection of HIV in this series are high and need to be reversed urgently."
41288437,Diagnostic Accuracy of Presepsin for Early Diagnosis of Sepsis in Critically Ill Obstetrics Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a significant maternal health issue; presepsin (sCD14-ST) has emerged as a novel biomarker for diagnosis of sepsis. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin for prediction of sepsis in critically ill obstetric patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in the Obstetrics Intensive Care Unit (ICU), over 18-month duration, involving 156 critically ill obstetric patients. Biomarkers including presepsin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and total leukocyte count (TLC) were measured on day 1 and day 3 of ICU admission. Presepsin was measured in serum sample by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using ELISA kit. RESULTS: 44.9% critically ill obstetrics patients developed sepsis in ICU. The most common comorbidity was acute kidney injury (AKI; 20.0%), and AKI was 28.5% in septic patients. Maternal death occurred in 17.9%, with a significantly higher mortality among those who had sepsis (32.9%) compared to those without sepsis (5.8%). Presepsin levels significantly increased from day 1 value of 260 pg/mL to day 3 value of 350 pg/ml, after the development of sepsis ( P < 0.001). Those who did not develop sepsis (controls) levels were decreased. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed presepsin had good diagnostic accuracy for prediction of sepsis presepsin at a cutoff value of >/=245 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 80.0%, at the area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.892, with confidence interval of 95% (AUC day 3 > day 1). Presepsin outperformed CRP and TLC in early sepsis detection. CONCLUSION: Presepsin is a reliable early marker for sepsis in critically ill obstetric patients, with better diagnostic accuracy than CRP and TLC. Its serial monitoring may offer valuable prognostic insight."
41288393,A Comparison of a Solid Organ Transplant Population-Specific Antibiogram With the Hospital-Wide Antibiogram.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are vulnerable to infections with multidrug-resistant organisms, and they often do not receive adequate empiric antimicrobials for serious Gram-negative infections. Knowledge of differences in antimicrobial resistance rates in this specific population can help guide empiric antimicrobial choices. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative organisms isolated from the adult SOT recipients with documented sepsis with the hospital-wide inpatient antibiogram. To evaluate empiric antimicrobial coverage, we constructed a Weighted-Incidence Syndromic Combination Antibiogram (WISCA) by calculating the proportion of susceptible isolates per antimicrobial agent. We then compared the coverage rates against our institution's sepsis treatment guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 90 Gram-negative isolates comprised the SOT cohort, while the inpatient antibiogram cohort had 1328 isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%) and Escherichia coli (31%) were the most common isolates in the SOT and inpatient antibiogram cohorts, respectively. Overall, antimicrobial resistance rates were higher in the SOT population compared to the hospital-wide inpatient antibiogram population. WISCA analysis showed imipenem was active for 59% of isolates as opposed to the institutional recommendation of piperacillin-tazobactam, which covered 39% of SOT isolates. CONCLUSION: Current empiric antimicrobial recommendations for SOT patients are based on data from the general patient population, which may not accurately reflect the resistance patterns in this unique population. Utilizing patient population-specific antibiograms may improve empiric antimicrobial therapy and warrants further research."
41288027,Antibiotic use rate in neonates: A comparison of categorical risk assessment and the sepsis calculator.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is defined as an infection with a positive blood culture within the first 7 days of life. The categorical risk assessment guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is used to manage high-risk infants, but it often results in a high rate of antibiotic use. A neonatal early-onset sepsis calculator (EOS calculator) was developed to reduce the overuse of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among infants born >/=35 weeks' gestation admitted to Vajira Hospital between October 1, 2018, and September 30, 2019. Infants were included if they had at least one risk factor for EOS or symptoms suggesting EOS. Relevant data were collected to assess antibiotic use rates based on the categorical risk assessment and the EOS calculator. Antibiotic use rates between the two methods were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 177 infants were included in this study. The mean gestational age (+/-SD) was 38.5 +/- 1.7 weeks, and the mean birth weight (+/-SD) was 2923.9 +/- 516.3 g. According to local guidelines, antibiotics were administered to 73 infants (41.2%). One infant had culture-proven EOS, yielding a prevalence among the total live births born at >/=35 weeks' gestation of 0.49 per 1000 live births (1/2031). No deaths were observed. Antibiotic use rates were 45.2% using the categorical risk assessment and 31.6% using the EOS calculator (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The rate of antibiotic use was lower with the EOS calculator than with the categorical risk assessment."
41288008,Percutaneous Management of Radial Artery Pseudoaneurysm: Two Illustrative Cases and a Literature Overview.,2026,"Radial artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA) is an uncommon but clinically relevant complication increasingly encountered with the expanding use of radial access in cardiology and critical care. Presentation and management vary widely according to etiology, patient frailty, and arterial wall integrity. We describe two representative cases: an elderly diabetic woman who developed a PSA after complex transradial coronary stenting and was successfully treated with selective coil embolization, and a man with cardiogenic shock and sepsis who developed a PSA following prolonged invasive monitoring and was managed with vascular plug devices. These cases illustrate the heterogeneous mechanisms leading to PSA and emphasize the need for individualized endovascular strategies in complex patients."
41287943,[Clinical features and prognostic risk assessment of pediatric sepsis].,2025,"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological features of pediatric sepsis in the Kashgar region and investigate factors associated with its prognosis, thereby providing evidence for implementing regional public health prevention and control policies. Methods: A single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted on the clinical data of pediatric sepsis patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of The First People's Hospital of Kashgar between January 2022 and December 2023. For the assessment of clinical outcomes, this study utilized a composite endpoint comprising ""length of hospital stay and survival status"", classifying patients into two groups: Group A (survived with hospital stay <28 days) and Group B (hospital stay >/=28 days or in-hospital mortality). Univariate and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with prognosis. Results: This study included a total of 79 pediatric patients with sepsis, with an age range of 1 month to 14 years and a median age of 8 months. Males accounted for 62.0% (49 males, 30 females). The rates of comorbid septic shock, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury were 73.4% (58/79), 24.1% (19/79), and 16.5% (13/79), respectively. The primary site of infection was the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for 34.2% (27/79), followed by the respiratory tract at 30.4% (24/79). Pathogens were detected in 59.5% (47/79) of the patients, with Staphylococcus aureus identified in 11 cases, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli in 6 cases each, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 5 cases, and Candida albicans in 3 cases. The mechanical ventilation rate was 59.5% (47/79). The total hospital length of stay ranged from 1 to 55 days, with a median of 14 days, while the ICU length of stay ranged from 1 to 29 days, with a median of 6 days. In-hospital mortality occurred in 15 cases (19.0%). Group A comprised 56 patients (70.9%), and Group B comprised 23 patients (29.1%). Univariate analysis revealed that Group A had significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), pediatric critical illness score (PCIS), and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (all P<0.05), and significantly lower pediatric risk of mortality Ⅲ (PRISM Ⅲ), pediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), lactate levels, pediatric multiple organ dysfunction score (P-MODS), pediatric sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA), septic shock rate, and mechanical ventilation rate compared to Group B (all P<0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis identified a high PELOD-2 score (OR: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.16-1.64, P<0.001) as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, while a high GCS (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.74-0.88, P<0.001) served as a protective factor against poor prognosis. The combination of PELOD2 and GCS demonstrated good predictive ability for in-hospital outcomes in pediatric sepsis patients, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.82 (95%CI: 0.72-0.92). Conclusion: In children with sepsis in the Kashgar region, gastrointestinal tract infection represents the most common source of infection. Elevated PELOD-2 scores and reduced GCS are both indicative of a poorer prognosis, and a combined model integrating these two scoring systems may serve as a valuable tool for prognostic assessment."
41287679,Spontaneous Perforation of Meckel's Diverticulum in a 37-Year-Old Woman: A Case Report.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Meckel's diverticulum (MD), the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, typically presents in an asymptomatic manner. However, peritonitis occurring as a result of ruptured MD is extremely rare in adults, and this may make diagnosis even more challenging. This presentation can often imitate other acute GI emergencies like appendicitis or even some gynecological conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of a 37-year-old female patient presenting with lower abdominal pain radiating to the right iliac fossa for three days, progressing to generalized abdominal pain along with signs of peritonitis. On exploratory laparotomy, findings included a severely congested and edematous MD with a large 1 cm perforation, as well as a mass of hard tissue within its wall. Segmental enterectomy with primary end-to-end anastomosis and an appendectomy was performed. DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis of ruptured MD should never be overlooked in adult patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and generalized peritonitis, even though it is very rare. Diagnosis of this disease preoperatively is extremely complex due to the fact that radiological findings are usually not specific and may imitate other acute abdominal or gynecological emergencies. For this reason, immediate surgical intervention is crucial to prevent complications such as widespread sepsis and chronic illness. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the importance of keeping the differential of ruptured MD under consideration when dealing with adults presenting with acute abdominal pain, even if a gynecological cause is initially suspected. Thus, early detection and immediate surgical intervention are key factors for more positive patient outcomes."
41287667,Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis in a Patient With Crohn's Disease Receiving Infliximab: A Diagnostic Challenge.,2025,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by uncontrolled immune activation. While pediatric HLH is well-recognized, adult cases often mimic sepsis or autoimmune flares, delaying diagnosis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its immunosuppressive treatments, including infliximab, have been increasingly linked to HLH. We report a 65-year-old man with Crohn's disease on infliximab who presented with persistent fever, chills, night sweats, headaches, and bradycardia. Laboratory testing revealed pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia (32,531 ng/mL), hypertriglyceridemia (11.5 mmol/L), hypofibrinogenemia (0.3 g/L), and elevated inflammatory markers. Infectious and autoimmune workups were negative, while CT imaging showed right upper lobe ground-glass opacities. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated histiocytic hyperplasia with hemophagocytosis. The patient fulfilled HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria and had a high H-score. Infliximab was discontinued, and high-dose corticosteroids were initiated, resulting in marked clinical improvement without the need for etoposide. This case highlights infliximab-associated HLH in an IBD patient and emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis using established criteria. Clinicians should consider HLH in immunosuppressed patients presenting with unexplained systemic inflammation and cytopenias, as timely recognition and tailored therapy can significantly improve survival."
41287109,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts mortality for sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis often leads to coagulation dysfunction, potentially progressing to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to higher mortality. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), an early stage of DIC, benefits from early detection and intervention. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) predicts mortality in inflammatory diseases, but its link to SIC mortality is unclear. This study explored NLR's relevance to clinical outcomes in SIC patients. METHODS: SIC patients from the MIMIC-IV database were divided into four groups by NLR quartiles. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, while secondary outcomes included 90-day and 1-year mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality. The association between NLR and clinical outcomes in SIC patients was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. RESULTS: Among 5323 SIC patients (60.49% male), the median NLR was 7.64 (IQR: 4.30-14.82). The 28-day mortality rate was 16.96% (903), with a higher NLR in non-survivors (12.01 vs. 7.02, P < 0.001), and with a difference of 4.99 (95% CI 3.38-4.62; Z = 13.5). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher NLR was linked to increased short- and long-term mortality. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that elevated NLR was significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.16-1.59; P < 0.001). RCS analysis indicated a J-shaped relationship between NLR and mortality, with the lowest risk at the second quartile (Q2). ROC analysis showed that NLR had modest predictive value for mortality risk, with an AUC of 0.642 (95% CI 0.622-0.663) for 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: NLR is significantly associated with mortality in SIC patients and can predict short-and long-term mortality. This finding suggests that the NLR may be useful in identifying patients with SIC at high risk of mortality. Elevated NLR is significantly associated with increased mortality in SIC patients and can predict short-and long-term mortality. The relationship between NLR and mortality risk is J-shaped, with the lowest risk observed in the second quartile. While NLR demonstrates modest predictive value, its accessibility and ease of use make it a potentially valuable tool for early risk stratification and informing clinical decision-making in SIC patients, especially in emergencies or resource-limited settings."
41286688,Analysis of risk factors and establishment of a predictive model for brain injury in neonates with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is prevalent among preterm neonates and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. While surgical intervention remains essential for advanced NEC, postoperative neonates exhibit an elevated risk of brain injury. However, which surgery-related factors exacerbate neonatal brain damage remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to identify risk factors for brain injury in neonates with surgical NEC and establish a predictive model to facilitate early identification and intervention, which may ultimately decrease neurodevelopmental impairment rates. METHODS: This study analyzed 181 consecutive NEC surgical cases at our tertiary referral center (2017-2023). Brain injury was confirmed by cranial MRI. Primary analysis was used to compare groups via Student's t test for normally distributed data and the Mann‒Whitney U/chi(2) test for nonparametric variables. Significant predictors (p < 0.05) were incorporated into multivariate logistic regression, with model performance validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed six independent risk factors (all p < 0.05): lower gestational age (GA) (OR 0.85 [95% CI: 0.73-0.98]; p = 0.028), higher procalcitonin (PCT) levels at surgery (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 1.01-1.06]; p = 0.017), postoperative sepsis (OR 3.46 [95% CI: 1.36-8.76]; p = 0.009), transmural necrosis with perforation (OR 3.03 [95% CI: 1.18-7.78]; p = 0.021), longer diagnosis-to-surgery intervals (> 24 h) (OR 3.52 [95% CI: 1.23-10.08]; p = 0.019), and retention of the necrotic bowel (OR 4.88 [95% CI: 1.50-15.91]; p = 0.009). The ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 for the prediction model. CONCLUSION: The incidence of brain injury in neonates with surgical NEC is independently associated with elevated PCT levels at surgery, the presence of sepsis, and the occurrence of transmural necrosis with perforation. Conversely, increased GA, early surgical recognition and intervention, and complete resection of the necrotic bowel may serve as potential protective factors against brain injury. The predictive model constructed on the basis of these findings demonstrated strong discriminative ability and we propose immediate neuroprotective intervention when model-predicted risk exceeds the 53% threshold."
41286668,Platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio as a novel prognostic biomarker in sepsis-associated AKI: a multicenter cohort study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury (SA-AKI) is a major complication in critically ill patients, yet early predictive biomarkers remain limited. Given the interplay between coagulation, inflammation, and microcirculatory dysfunction in SA-AKI pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio (PHR) and SA-AKI development in multicenter intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. METHODS: We extracted patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) databases. Based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, patients were stratified into AKI (n = 4,825) and non-AKI (n = 3,390) cohorts. Multiple statistical approaches-including multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability weighting (IPW)-were employed to adjust for confounders. The primary outcome was SA-AKI incidence. RESULTS: Elevated PHR was consistently associated with increased SA-AKI risk. In the adjusted logistic regression model, PHR remained independently predictive (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05-1.07; P < 0.001). This association was validated through PSM (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.11-1.13; P < 0.001) and IPW (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03; P < 0.001). The incidence of AKI significantly increases when PHR > 20. Generalized additive model (GAM) analysis revealed a linear correlation between PHR > 22 and SA-AKI mortality (P < 0.001), though PHR showed no significant association with AKI severity (P = 0.029). Our study demonstrates that the emerging biomarker PHR alone achieved an AUC of 0.845 for prognostic prediction and 0.584 for diagnostic performance. When combined with SOFA and SAPS-II, the prognostic model (Model 4) significantly improved (AUC = 0.906 and 0.713), outperforming individual components. CONCLUSIONS: PHR demonstrates a statistically significant association with SA-AKI risk in our analyses, its modest discriminative capacity highlights its role as a complementary rather than standalone predictor. These findings support further validation of PHR as a pragmatic biomarker to identify high-risk sepsis patients who may benefit from intensified hemodynamic or coagulation monitoring.

41286650,Capillary leak syndrome in sepsis: the role of intrinsic coagulation pathway activation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The coagulation system is closely linked to the inflammatory response and kinin system activation in sepsis, but its contribution to sepsis-associated capillary leak syndrome (SACLS) remains elusive. This study explored the underlying role of the coagulation system in SACLS. METHODS: Patients with sepsis were recruited to evaluate the early predictive potential of coagulation function-related indicators for capillary leakage. Patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and scrub typhus, conditions featuring SACLS as a typical manifestation, were selected to validate the predictive value of coagulation-related indicators in SACLS. The levels of coagulation factors in patients with sepsis were analyzed to elucidate the altered mechanisms in the coagulation system. Additionally, rat SACLS models were established via an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide to corroborate the changes and potential effects of the coagulation system during SACLS. RESULTS: Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) exhibited predictive potential for diagnosing capillary leak syndrome in patients with sepsis. APTT displayed higher sensitivity than PT in detecting SACLS at an early stage. Compared with the findings in patients with sepsis and normal APTT, the activities of coagulation factor Ⅺ (FXI) and FXII in plasma and levels of complement 3 and 4 in serum were significantly decreased in patients with APTT prolongation (all P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with APTT prolongation (all P < 0.05). FXI and FXII activities were decreased in the plasma of SACLS model rats (P < 0.001). Conversely, FXII and complement levels were elevated in the lungs (both P < 0.05), accompanied by elevated bradykinin levels (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APTT is a sensitive indicator for predicting SACLS. APTT prolongation in plasma might be attributable to the enrichment of FXII in the microcirculation. The microcirculatory enrichment of FXII might activate the kinin and complement systems, contributing to the process of capillary leakage."
41286089,Development and validation of a machine learning model for predicting mortality risk in veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients.,2025,"This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based mortality risk prediction model for V-A ECMO patients to improve the precision of clinical decision-making. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 280 patients receiving V-A ECMO from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Yulin First People's Hospital, and the MIMIC-IV database. The data from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and the MIMIC-IV database were merged and randomly divided in a 7:3 ratio into a training set and an internal validation set, respectively. The dataset from Yulin First People's Hospital was reserved as an external validation cohort. The primary study outcome was defined as in-hospital mortality.Feature selection was conducted using Lasso regression, followed by the development of six machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LightGBM, and CatBoost. Model performance was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Model validation was performed through calibration and decision curve analysis. Feature importance was evaluated using SHAP, and subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the model's applicability across different clinical scenarios. In internal validation, the Logistic Regression model performed the best, with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.93), accuracy of 0.76, sensitivity of 0.73, specificity of 0.79, and an F1 score of 0.73. It outperformed other models (RF: AUC = 0.79, DNN: AUC = 0.78, SVM: AUC = 0.76, LightGBM: AUC = 0.71, CatBoost: AUC = 0.77). External validation yielded consistent results, with the Logistic Regression model's AUC at 0.75 (95% CI: 0.56-0.92), accuracy of 0.69, sensitivity of 0.64, specificity of 0.73, and an F1 score of 0.66. Calibration curve analysis revealed that the Logistic Regression model had the lowest Brier score (0.1496), indicating the most reliable predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model provided the highest net benefit across most decision thresholds. SHAP analysis identified lactate, age, and albumin as key predictors of mortality, with lactate and age positively correlated, and albumin negatively correlated. Subgroup analysis revealed better performance in the cardiac arrest group (AUC = 0.81), non-sepsis group (AUC = 0.75), and non-diabetes group (AUC = 0.78). The Logistic Regression-based mortality risk prediction model for V-A ECMO patients demonstrated comparable or even favorable performance to more complex machine learning models, with the advantage of higher interpretability.By explicitly incorporating lactate, age, and albumin as the principal predictors, this model facilitates precise risk stratification and provides practical support for clinical decision-making in ECMO management."
41285832,Explainable AI unravels sepsis heterogeneity via coagulation-inflammation profiles for prognosis and stratification.,2025,"Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital mortality, and its significant heterogeneity complicates prognosis and stratification. To address this challenge, we developed an explainable artificial intelligence prognostic model (SepsisFormer, a transformer-based neural network) and an automated risk-stratification tool (SMART) for sepsis. In a multi-center retrospective study of 12,408 sepsis patients, SepsisFormer achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.9301, sensitivity: 0.9346, and specificity: 0.8312). SMART (AUC: 0.7360) surpassed most established scoring systems. Seven coagulation-inflammatory routine laboratory measurements and patient age were identified to classify patients' four risk levels (mild, moderate, severe, dangerous) and two subphenotypes (CIS1 and CIS2), each with distinct clinical characteristics and mortality rates. Notably, patients with moderate/severe levels or CIS2 derive more significant benefits from anticoagulant treatment. Our work, therefore, offers a set of simple, real-time executable tools for sepsis heterogeneity, demonstrating the potential to enhance sepsis clinical practice globally, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare settings."
41285725,Deriving consensus sepsis clusters via goal-directed subgroup identification in multi-omics study.,2025,"Sepsis, a syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host responses to infection, exhibits profound pathobiological heterogeneity, hindering the development of effective therapies. Current subtyping approaches, often reliant on single-omics data or unsupervised clustering, yield poorly reproducible and therapeutically misaligned classifications. Here, we introduce a goal-directed subgroup identification (GD-SI) framework that optimizes patient stratification for differential treatment responses, integrating longitudinal multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, phenomic) from 1327 subjects across 43 hospitals. While supervised multi-omics integration frameworks (e.g., DIABLO) effectively capture shared biological signals, our approach anchors subgroup discovery directly to treatment-effect optimization. This strategy achieves substantial cross-omic concordance and, crucially, generalizes to predict differential treatment response across international critical care databases. Patients stratified by GD-SI-derived benefit scores for restrictive versus liberal fluid resuscitation exhibited marked survival differences, with similar advantages observed for ulinastatin immunomodulation. External validations in MIMIC-IV and ZiGongDB confirm prognostic generalizability. This framework reconciles biological heterogeneity with clinical actionability, offering a scalable infrastructure for precision trial design and personalized sepsis management. Our findings underscore the translational potential of omics-driven, goal-directed stratification to overcome decades of therapeutic stagnation in critical care."
41285675,Sepsis management in the antimicrobial resistance era.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide. Its lethality, along with the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, is worsened by rising antibiotic resistance. Managing sepsis and septic shock is challenging, as underlying conditions can limit the reliability of many biomarkers used for early diagnosis. AREAS COVERED: This review comprehensively overviews the epidemiologic characteristics of sepsis, with particular emphasis on the key biomarkers used to support early diagnosis. Additionally, it explores emerging techniques for rapid microbiological identification of sepsis caused by multidrug- resistant organisms and evaluates the effectiveness of newly introduced antibiotics. EXPERT OPINION: In severe cases progressing to septic shock, timely and accurate diagnosis is critical. It is mandatory to make every effort to shorten the time to diagnosis in order to enable appropriate supportive care and targeted antibiotic therapy. In this context, novel microbiological diagnostic methods should be considered to facilitate early detection of multidrug-resistant organisms and promote the initiation of effective empiric antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the development of new molecules with innovative mechanisms of action, alongside therapeutic strategies targeting specific patterns of the immune response, is expected to improve the patient survival rates."
41285673,Enhanced CRISPR-Cas12a Fluorescent Assay for Detecting Trace Levels of Procalcitonin.,2025,"Rapid and accurate detection of procalcitonin (PCT), a major biomarker for bacterial infections and sepsis, remains a pressing need in clinical diagnostics because sepsis progresses rapidly and may initially present with nonspecific or even subtle symptoms. Herein, we report a CRISPR-Cas12a-based fluorescence biosensing platform for ultrasensitive detection of PCT. The platform employs antibody-functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) for specific protein enrichment and antibody- and oligonucleotide- dual-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for high-density DNA payload. After sandwich complex formation with the target PCT, a programmed ssDNA strand is released by thermal denaturation, which then activates Cas12a collateral cleavage, thereby generating a fluorescence signal. Thorough physicochemical characterizations, including zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, UV-vis spectroscopy, and TEM, were carried out to confirm the successful functionalization of MBs and AuNPs. The developed PCT sensor was highly sensitive with a limit of detection (LOD) reaching 3 pg/mL. Moreover, the biosensor exhibited an excellent specificity toward PCT against clinically relevant interferents such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2beta (IL-2beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), human serum albumin (HSA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and simulated serum sample analysis was successfully carried out with the recoveries ranging from 108 to 122%. The PCT sensing technique developed in this work offers the potential to be expanded to construct a multiplexing platform for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarker species for early and accurate disease diagnosis."
41284646,Prediction of graft loss in living donor liver transplantation during the early postoperative period.,2025,"Liver transplantation is almost the only way to save patients with end-stage liver disease. Particularly, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained importance in recent years thanks to the shorter waiting times and better graft quality than with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some patients experience graft loss due to unexpected infections, sepsis, or immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted organ. An urgent need exists to clarify which patients experience graft loss. Several models have been proposed, but most analyze the classic DDLT, and knowledge about LDLT is lacking. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 748 patients who underwent LDLT. By adapting machine learning methods, we predicted early graft loss (within 180 days postoperatively) with better performance than conventional models. The model enabled us to stratify a highly heterogeneous sample of patients into five groups. By focusing on survival time, we next categorized the patients into three groups with early, intermediate, and late or no graft loss. Notably, we identified the intermediate-loss group as a distinct population similar to the early-loss population but with different survival times. Additionally, by proposing a hierarchical prediction method, we developed an approach to distinguish these populations using data up to 30 days postoperatively. Our findings will enable the early identification of individuals at risk of graft loss, particularly those in the early- and intermediate-loss groups. This will allow for appropriate patient care, such as switching to DDLT, identifying other living donors for LDLT, or preparing for re-transplantation, leading to a bottom-up improvement in transplant success rates."
41284248,The Effect of Extracorporeal Hemopurification Combined With Conventional Anti-Infection on Clinical Prognosis and Immune Function in Sepsis: A Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Aims/Background Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide, with conventional treatments showing limited efficacy. Extracorporeal hemopurification (EH) techniques have emerged as promising adjunctive therapies. This study aims to explore the impact of EH techniques, including hemofiltration, hemoperfusion, hemodialysis, and hemosorption, on the clinical prognosis and immune function of patients with sepsis. Methods We searched relevant literature describing patients with a precise clinical diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock across various databases, including MEDLINE, AMED, Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu, and Wanfang, published from January 2010 to October 2023. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included to compare those receiving EH and conventional anti-infective treatment. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software after two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information, and evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome indicators included in-hospital mortality (IHM) and length of ICU stay (LOS-ICU). Furthermore, the changes in T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) levels were analyzed and expressed as relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), or mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) as appropriate for the type of outcome measure. Results This analysis included 30 studies (n = 2262) (1267 in the EH group and 995 in the conventional treatment group). We observed that EH treatment, such as hemopurification, hemofiltration, hemoperfusion, hemodialysis, and hemoadsorption, significantly reduced IHM in sepsis patients (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.68-0.84, p < 0.00001). However, there was no significant impact on LOS-ICU (MD = -0.44, 95% CI: -2.29-1.41, p = 0.64). Subgroup analyses suggested that cytokine adsorption (OR = 0.69, p = 0.17) or polymyxin B blood perfusion (OR = 0.73, p = 0.06) did not reduce IHM in sepsis patients. Similarly, EH did not improve IHM in patients with septic acute renal failure (RR = 0.82, p = 0.27) and IHM in patients with burn-induced sepsis (RR = 0.59, p = 0.07). For sepsis patients with improved Th1/Th2 value of immune factor levels by EH, IHM was not significantly reduced (RR = 0.61, p = 0.08), and LOS-ICU also showed no significant difference (MD = 0.34, 95% CI: -5.92-6.60, p = 0.92). Conclusion For sepsis patients without relevant contraindications, EH holds promise as an adjunctive therapy, but the modulation of immune factor levels during treatment does not consistently influence the LOS-ICU."
41284003,Volumetric analysis of term-equivalent age MRI in post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation reveals association between deep grey matter volume and developmental outcomes.,2025,"AIM: This study aimed to identify factors influencing brain volumes at term-equivalent age (TEA) in preterm infants with post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) and explore how these volumes, and other factors, correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome (NDO). METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of 84 infants with PHVD managed on a standardised pathway at a single centre between 2012 and 2020. Brain volumes were measured from TEA MRI scans in 31 infants. NDO was assessed at one and two years. Primary analyses included the 31 infants with measured brain volumes. Sensitivity analysis included all 84 infants using multiple imputation for missing brain volumes. RESULTS: Sepsis (-12.75mL, 95% CI -17.89 to -7.61) was linked to smaller cerebellar volume. Intubation (-0.09mL/day, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.04) and inotropic support (-3.19mL, 95% CI -6.18 to -0.20) were associated with reduced deep grey matter (dGM) volume. Larger dGM volume predicted lower odds of poor NDO at two years (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94). Sensitivity analysis supported these findings. INTERPRETATION: dGM volume at TEA could predict NDO among infants with PHVD. Addressing modifiable factors influencing dGM volume may improve outcomes. Understanding associations of independent variables with NDO is essential to evaluate the impact of neurosurgical interventions. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: - Among infants with post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation: - Sepsis was associated with smaller cerebellar volumes at term-equivalent age. - Intubation and inotrope use were associated with smaller deep grey matter volumes at term-equivalent age. - Larger deep grey matter volume at term-equivalent age was associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcome at two years."
41283732,The utility of T. pallidum PCR testing in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis: a systematic review.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital syphilis (CS) due to maternal transmission of Treponema pallidum is rising. The interpretation of conventional diagnostic methods is complicated by maternal antibody transfer. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) syphilis testing has been widely studied in adults. PCR is reliable, fast, and can be performed on a variety of sample types. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to evaluate existing data and summarise current international recommendations on the use of PCR testing on placental and neonatal samples for the diagnosis of CS. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases was conducted, alongside an internet search of international congenital syphilis guidelines. The review was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies: The PRISMA-DTA statement. The review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Studies reporting PCR testing on placental or neonatal samples in infants born to mothers with syphilis were included. Guidelines with specific recommendations for congenital syphilis PCR testing were included. RESULTS: Of 221 studies screened, 21 were included, comprising 146 placental and 828 neonatal PCR samples. Only 4 multicentre studies were included. 8 studies included 5 or fewer PCR samples, including 5 single-patient case reports. Five international guidelines were included; all reserved PCR's application for high-risk infants with no clear guidance for low-risk infants. DISCUSSION: PCR shows promise as an adjunct diagnostic tool for congenital syphilis. However, evidence remains limited. Multicentre diagnostic accuracy studies are urgently needed to inform international recommendations and optimise diagnostic strategies."
41283169,Mycotic Pseudoaneurysms of the Superior Mesenteric and Splenic Artery: A Case Report.,2025,"Visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are defined as aneurysms of the splenic, superior mesenteric, or inferior mesenteric arteries and their respective branches. Mycotic aneurysms, defined as aneurysms of the arterial wall caused by bacterial or fungal embolization, are a rapidly progressive and often fatal form of arterial aneurysms that can form in the visceral arteries. Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms of the visceral arteries most commonly present as abdominal pain. The ambiguity with which they often present, paired with their high risk of rupture and hemorrhage, creates a highly precarious situation for clinicians. Failure to identify an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the visceral arteries in time can be a fatal mistake. We present a case of mycotic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery and splenic artery secondary to infective endocarditis managed with open surgical resection, coil embolization, and splenectomy in a 36-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use. The patient presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and confusion. He was admitted for sepsis and work-up of suspected bacteremia and endocarditis. MRI revealed multiple cortical infarcts suggestive of an embolic shower, and transesophageal echocardiogram showed mitral valve vegetations. CT imaging showed an aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery, later determined to be a pseudoaneurysm. The patient underwent emergent open superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm resection as well as splenectomy due to intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysms and associated necrosis and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Our case highlights the importance of considering visceral artery aneurysms when formulating a list of differential diagnoses for patients presenting with abdominal pain due to their vague presenting symptoms in conjunction with their potential to rapidly progress to aneurysmal rupture and catastrophic hemorrhage."
41282281,"Severe, refractory paraneoplastic aplastic anemia secondary to primary peritoneal carcinoma: a case report.",2025,"Acquired aplastic anemia may rarely present as a paraneoplastic syndrome primarily associated with thymomas and lymphoma. We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of paraneoplastic aplastic anemia secondary to high-grade serous primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC). A 63-year-old female with a pathogenic germline BRCA1 mutation was found to have pancytopenia at the time of PPC diagnosis. She received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic, and immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone prior to primary cytoreductive surgery to no apparent gross residual disease. Stage IIIC2 PPC was confirmed on pathology. Her post-operative course was complicated by a large bowel anastomotic leak and sepsis in the setting of neutropenia. Persistent pancytopenia led to the diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia on serial bone marrow biopsies. She was treated with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin and subsequent addition of weekly paclitaxel, resulting in reduction in her serum Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) and no radiographic evidence of disease. Despite initial response, her clinical deterioration and her decision to forego further cancer- or aplastic anemia-directed therapy resulted in transition to home hospice care, and she was discharged 119 days after admission. This case report highlights the importance of multi-disciplinary collaboration to manage the medical complexities of paraneoplastic aplastic anemia secondary to a gynecologic malignancy."
41281995,Attenuation of sepsis-induced myocardial injury by Xiangdan injection via mitochondrial protection and inflammation suppression in mice.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a leading cause of organ dysfunction and mortality in septic patients. Effective myocardial-protective therapies remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cardioprotective effects of Xiangdan injection in murine SIMI models caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to sham, sepsis, and three Xiangdan dose groups for each bacterial model using a randomization schedule. Xiangdan injection was administered by oral gavage 12 h before and immediately after bacterial challenge (prophylaxis/early intervention). Outcomes included survival, serum inflammatory cytokines, cardiac biomarkers, histopathology, and ultrastructural mitochondrial integrity. RESULTS: Xiangdan injection markedly improved survival, reduced inflammatory cytokines and cardiac biomarkers, ameliorated myocardial histopathology, and preserved mitochondrial integrity in a dose-dependent manner in both sepsis models (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Xiangdan injection conferred robust cardioprotection in sepsis, combining anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of cardiac injury markers, and preservation of mitochondrial structure. These outcomes are consistent with the known capacity of traditional Chinese medicine formulations to modulate TLR4/NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, thereby supporting mechanistic suppression of these cascades in our model."
41281283,"Predicting acute kidney injury in children with sepsis using red blood cell distribution and biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C).",2025,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a risk score model for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) in children with sepsis, using red blood cell distribution width (RDW), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and additional biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C) based on logistic regression (LR) analysis. METHODS: Children treated in the ICU of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from July 2021 to August 2022 were enrolled. The experimental group (Exp) included 155 children with sepsis, while the control group (Ctrl) consisted of 70 children. LR analysis was employed to identify factors associated with AKI risk. The Exp was further divided into two subgroups: the routine group (RG, n=77) and the intervention group (IG, n=78). The IG received intervention based on the risk score model, while the RG received routine treatment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: The two groups observed significant differences in white blood cell count (WBC) and RDW levels. The development of AKI in sepsis patients was strongly associated with RDW, APACHE II score, and the biomarkers PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C. After the intervention, the incidence of AKI and AKI grade 3 significantly decreased, along with lower rates of renal replacement therapy and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The LR-based model integrating RDW, APACHE II score, and biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, cystatin C) effectively predicts the risk of AKI in children with sepsis, offering a valuable tool for early intervention and improved patient outcomes."
41281040,"Comparison of Procalcitonin, C-reactive Protein, and Interleukin-6 in the Postoperative Course After Lung Decortication Surgery: A Prospective Observational Study.",2025,"Introduction Lung decortication is a surgical intervention performed to remove the fibrous pleural layer in conditions like pleural empyema or chronic pleuritis. Despite its therapeutic benefits, the postoperative period poses a high risk for complications such as infections and sepsis, which can significantly affect recovery. Biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) are increasingly employed to aid early detection of such complications. Objectives To evaluate and compare the roles of IL-6, CRP, and PCT in detecting postoperative sepsis in patients undergoing lung decortication and to determine their clinical utility in guiding early management decisions. Methods This observational study was conducted in the Departments of Anaesthesiology and General Surgery, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. A total of 112 patients aged 18-65 years with clinically proven pleural empyema undergoing elective lung decortication were enrolled. Patients on preoperative anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5, biomarkers were analyzed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US), applying t-tests, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significance threshold of p<0.05. Results Of 112 patients, 44 (39.3%) developed sepsis. Septic patients were older (mean age 40.84+/-14.08 years) than non-septic patients (mean age 28.09+/-8.00 years). PCT levels were significantly higher in septic patients across all time points (p<0.001), declining over time postoperatively. CRP levels were significantly elevated in septic patients on days 3 and 5. IL-6 and CRP showed limited but supportive diagnostic value. Mortality was higher in the septic group (6.8%), though not statistically significant. Conclusion Procalcitonin is the most reliable biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of postoperative sepsis following lung decortication. Combining PCT with CRP and IL-6 enhances diagnostic accuracy and informs timely therapeutic interventions."
41280255,Death of a Child With Celiac Disease and Cerebral Bleeding Requires Extensive Post-Mortem Analysis to Clarify the Underlying Pathophysiology.,2025,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is characterized by vasogenic edema, which presents as hyperintense diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintense apparent diffusion coefficient maps on multimodal magnetic resonance imaging. PRES often occurs in association with hypertension, renal failure, and sepsis. Before diagnosing PRES, infections and autoimmune encephalitis, vasculitis, venous sinus thrombosis, hemorrhagic stroke, and lymphoma should be carefully ruled out. Differentiating PRES is crucial because its treatment differs significantly from these other conditions."
41278526,Clinical Insights and Brief Research Report on Mesh Erosion Into Bowel Following Hernia Repair: A Single-Centre Series of Eight Cases.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Mesh erosion into the bowel is a rare but severe complication following hernia repair. Though synthetic mesh reduces recurrence rates, it carries risks of chronic infection, adhesion, and erosion. Literature is limited to isolated reports, and this case series aims to provide clinical insights into diagnosis and management challenges. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed eight patients with mesh-bowel erosion at a tertiary care centre in Delhi, India (2016-2025). Data on clinical presentation, surgical history, imaging, and management were analyzed. All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy with bowel resection and mesh removal when feasible. RESULTS: The series included eight patients with a median age of 67 (range: 50-75). The time from initial surgery to erosion was highly variable, ranging from weeks to over 20 years. These complications arose from meshes placed in various anatomical planes, including onlay, preperitoneal, retrorectus, and intraperitoneal positions. The predominant clinical presentation was an enterocutaneous fistula (7/8 patients), with the small bowel as the most common erosion site. Preoperative imaging often underestimated the extent of erosion, which was confirmed intraoperatively. All patients required laparotomy; management included bowel resection (n = 7), mesh explantation (n = 6), and stoma formation (n = 5). One patient died from sepsis. CONCLUSION: Mesh erosion into the bowel, though infrequent, leads to significant morbidity and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with vague abdominal complaints and history of hernioplasty. Timely diagnosis, aggressive surgical management, and multidisciplinary care are key to optimizing outcomes."
41278405,Multiple Pyogenic Arthritis Caused by Edwardsiella tarda Bacteremia: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2025,"Infection with Edwardsiella tarda, a Gram-negative rod found in freshwater and seawater, is typically associated with the ingestion of raw fish and commonly causes enteritis, liver abscess, cholangitis, and cholecystitis in humans. However, multiple pyogenic arthritis, which have not been previously reported, are considered exceedingly rare. Herein, we report a case of E. tarda bacteremia that resulted in multiple pyogenic arthritis and septic shock, which was successfully treated with intensive care. An 84-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease was transferred to our hospital for swelling and pain in the left shoulder, following initial treatment for pyogenic arthritis of the left hip at a previous hospital. Imaging revealed the formation of abscesses in the shoulders and hips. He underwent emergent debridement of the left shoulder abscess and was admitted to the ICU. E. tarda was identified from blood cultures on Day 3 of hospitalization. The patient developed septic shock and required vasopressor support. Intensive care, including the administration of appropriate antibiotics and surgical debridement, yielded clinical improvement. The patient was discharged from the ICU on Day 8. Cases of multiple pyogenic arthritis caused by E. tarda bacteremia have the potential for rapid clinical deterioration. Our patient had multiple risk factors, including cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, which might have predisposed him to a severe disease course. Early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement, and intensive care are crucial for patient survival, and early transfer to a tertiary center may improve outcomes. Even rare infections, such as E. tarda, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of immunocompromised patients."
41278291,Resistance to imatinib in a ETV6::PDGFRB rearranged myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with high-risk mutations: a case report.,2025,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB)-rearranged myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) are rare hematologic malignancies typically responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib. However, resistance-particularly in the context of co-occurring high-risk mutations-is uncommon and poorly characterized. We report a case of a 65-year-old man diagnosed with a ETV6::PDGFRB-translocated MLN, presenting as atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), who exhibited a brief response with development of resistance to imatinib. Although the patient initially achieved hematologic and partial cytogenetic remission, residual fibrosis and cytogenetic abnormalities persisted despite dose escalation. Molecular profiling revealed high-risk mutations in ASXL1, KRAS, NRAS, SETBP1, and SRSF2, along with a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in IDH2. The patient progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) within 11 months despite sequential therapies including dasatinib and azacitidine-venetoclax, ultimately succumbing to sepsis. This case highlights the limitations of TKI monotherapy in MLNs with PDGFRB rearrangements and co-existing high-risk mutations, underscoring the importance of early molecular profiling and consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in cases with poor risk features."
41278078,Reverse Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Woman With Clostridioides difficile Colitis and a Sepsis-Like Syndrome: A Case Study.,2025,"In this report, we present a case of reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (rTTC) in an elderly female, 74 years old, with Clostridioides difficile colitis and sepsis-like features complicated by hypotension and arrhythmias. The diagnosis was eventually established through echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Supportive therapy favored recovery after diagnosis. This case of rTTC highlights a serious, although rare, cardiac condition that emphasizes the importance of workup and recognition to support optimal management and recovery and underscores the need to keep stress-induced cardiomyopathies in mind in critically ill patients."
41278032,Identification of novel phenotypes in pediatric sepsis based on blood glucose trajectories.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Metabolic heterogeneity in sepsis is a critical determinant of prognosis. This study applied group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify blood glucose trajectory phenotypes in pediatric sepsis and elucidate their associations with clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling 1,178 pediatric patients diagnosed with sepsis who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between 2014 and 2022. Dynamic blood glucose data were collected within 72 h of ICU admission, and GBTM was employed to classify trajectory phenotypes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. A subgroup analysis focused specifically on patients with septic shock. RESULTS: The analysis identified four distinct blood glucose trajectory phenotypes: Group 1 (7.3%): Slow-recovery hypoglycemia, predominantly among infants with severe liver injury, coagulopathy, and hyperlactatemia (in-hospital mortality: 13.79%). Group 2 (59.9%): Normoglycemia with minimal organ dysfunction (reference group; mortality: 5.10%). Group 3 (27.7%): Persistent mild hyperglycemia, characterized by elevated inflammatory markers and mild organ injury (mortality: 8.26%). Group 4 (4.9%): Persistent severe hyperglycemia associated with renal impairment and lactate accumulation (mortality: 17.24%). Multivariate analysis revealed Group 4 as an independent risk factor for mortality (aOR = 3.13, 95% CI 1.38-7.07). In the septic shock subgroup, the mortality risks for Group 1 and Group 4 increased by 5.2-fold and 8.28-fold, respectively (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: GBTM effectively stratifies pediatric sepsis into distinct blood glucose trajectory phenotypes. Persistent severe hyperglycemia (Group 4) independently predicts in-hospital mortality, while slow-recovery hypoglycemia (Group 1) indicates a poor prognosis in septic shock. Phenotype-guided interventions are recommended: early insulin therapy (target blood glucose <10 mmol/L) for Group 4 and prophylactic glucose infusion (target >3.8 mmol/L) for Group 1."
41277208,Prevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance of Nontyphoidal Salmonellosis in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a significant cause of food- and water-transmitted illness in the world, with the burden amplified in low-socioeconomic countries such as India. While most infections present as self-limiting gastroenteritis, vulnerable populations may develop invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis (iNTS). This study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical spectrum, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of NTS isolates in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 NTS isolates were recovered from clinical samples, including stool, blood, pus, and urine. Identification was performed using the VITEK-2 system, and serotyping of fifteen isolates was done at the National Salmonella and Escherichia Center, Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the VITEK-2 compact system. RESULTS: The prevalence of NTS among 1,08,468 samples was 0.056%. Most isolates were from stool samples, followed by blood, pus, and urine. Most patients presented with acute gastroenteritis (56%), often associated with outside food consumption. S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium were the most common serovars isolated. Extraintestinal manifestations included diabetic cellulitis, sepsis, and a rare case of generalized lymphadenopathy in a child, later diagnosed with Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD), and a case of neonatal meningitis in a 15-day-old infant. All isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem (100%). However, resistance to ceftriaxone was 22.9%, ciprofloxacin 31.1%, ampicillin 14.7% and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 3.27%. CONCLUSION: Nontyphoidal Salmonella continues to pose a public health threat in India, particularly with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. These findings underscore the importance of prudent antibiotic usage, robust surveillance systems, and public health interventions focused on food safety, sanitation, and targeted education."
41276946,"CRISPR in MOF Formulation with Enhanced Stability, Activity, and Altered PAM Specificity for Broad-Spectrum Diagnosis of Bacterial Sepsis.",2026,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by polymicrobial infections and remains a global health emergency that requires rapid and broad-spectrum diagnostics. Existing CRISPR-based assays face two major limitations that restrict their application for sepsis: narrow protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site compatibility and poor enzyme stability under clinical and environmental stresses. A modular diagnostic platform is presented, CRISPR-FLEXMO (CRISPR with flexible PAM in metal-organic framework encapsulation, MOF), which integrates a PAM-relaxed Cas12a variant (K607R) with a manganese-coordinated MOF (Mn-MOF) for stable and specific detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. The system targets a conserved region upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 16S rRNA gene containing a universal TTCC PAM, enabling broad-spectrum detection with a single universal primer pair across Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. The K607R variant shows enhanced cis- and trans-cleavage activity, while Mn-MOF encapsulation maintains enzyme functionality under ambient, thermal, and chaotropic stress. The assay detects as low as 10 CFU mL(-1) in bacterial lysates following amplification and achieves 100% sensitivity and specificity in serum samples from 15 sepsis patients and 3 healthy individuals, with no cross-reactivity to six respiratory viruses. The platform retains over 78% activity after 12 weeks of room-temperature storage, offering a field-deployable CRISPR diagnostic solution for next-generation infectious disease detection."
41276942,High BMI and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence are associated with increased risk of severe bacterial infections in adulthood.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Obesity and poor physical fitness in youth are established risk factors for future cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, their potential impact on the risk of severe bacterial infections later in life remains unclear. METHODS: This register-based cohort study followed almost 1 million Swedish conscripts (mean age 18.3 years) over a period of three decades. Measured body mass index (BMI) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) at conscription to military service served as exposure variables, whereas outcomes included morbidity and mortality attributed to bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and infective endocarditis. RESULTS: High BMI and low CRF in late adolescence were strongly associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and infective endocarditis in adulthood. The highest risk was seen among the obese for sepsis (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1 (2.7-3.5)), with elevated hazards observed already at high-normal BMI levels (22.5-25 kg/m(2)), compared with BMI 18.5-19.9. The risk of dying due to bacterial infections increased gradually with higher BMI. High, compared with low CRF, was associated with lower risk of contracting bacterial infections (0.78, 0.76-0.80), and dying from them (0.58, 0.51-0.65). CONCLUSION: High BMI and low CRF in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of contracting and dying of severe bacterial infections later in life. Hence, addressing these preventable risk factors in youths may serve as an effective measure to improve their long-term health."
41276893,Does ethnicity impact the long-term outcome after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis?,2025,"BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic disparities were reported to impact the phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease and its treatment. The impact of race/ethnicity on ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA's) outcomes is unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether it impacts IPAA's outcomes. METHODS: A prospectively maintained IPAA database(1983-2022) was searched to identify patients with IPAA who had race/ethnicity data available regardless of diagnosis. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: Whites and Non-Whites. We analysed patients' demographics, postoperative complications, Kaplan-Meier pouch survival, function (stool number, seepage), quality of life (QoL) scores, social, dietary and sexual restrictions. RESULTS: A total of 4954 patients were included, with 4674 whites and 280 non-whites. Non-Whites consisted of Black (123, 44%), Asians (23, 8.2%) and Hispanics (134, 48%). The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender and pathological diagnosis (p = 0.16). The rate of long-term anastomotic leaks, pelvic sepsis and strictures was not significantly different between groups. There was a higher rate of pouchitis in White (29%) vs. Non-White (18%) (p < 0.001); fistula [White (8%) vs. Non-White (4.5%) (p = 0.04)] and postoperative obstruction [White (13%) vs. Non-White (9%) (p = 0.04)]. The Kaplan-Meier pouch retention was similar (97% at 5 years, 96% at 10 years and 95% at 15 years) in White and Non-White patients. The average QoL scores were comparable between Non-White (7.7 +/- 2.5) and White (7.9 +/- 2.4) (p = 0.34). Non-Whites had more social restrictions (25%) vs. Whites (15%) (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In a large IPAA cohort, more White patients had pouchitis compared to Non-White patients. Social restrictions were more prevalent in Non-White patients compared to those in White patients over the long term. More research is needed to understand how race/ethnicity impacts the IPAA outcomes."
41276020,Genetic plasticity of Escherichia coli causing bloodstream infections in India: A focus on phylogroups A to F.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is a major pathogen in bloodstream infections (BSIs), with increasing concern over antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the evolving pathogenic potential of phylogroups traditionally considered commensal. This study investigates the genetic characteristics of E. coli isolates causing BSIs in India, with a focus on phylogroups A to F. METHODS: 204 E. coli bloodstream isolates received at a tertiary hospital in India were whole genome sequenced. Phylogroups, sequence types (STs), antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factors (VFs), and plasmid replicon types were determined. Bioinformatics analyses include MLST, ResFinder, VirulenceFinder, PlasmidFinder, and ClermonTyping for phylogroup assignment. RESULTS: Phylogroup B2 (35 %) was the most prevalent, followed by phylogroup A (32 %) and D (19 %). ST131 (B2) emerged as the dominant clone (22 %). Phylogroup A isolates, previously considered commensal and primarily associated with high AMR, now demonstrated notable acquisition of virulence factors such as fimH and iutA, indicating an emerging role as significant BSI pathogens. These isolates also showed high clonal diversity (e.g., ST167, ST410, ST617). Key resistance genes included blaCTX-M (53 %) and blaTEM (25 %), frequently associated with IncF plasmids. Multi-replicon plasmid profiles, particularly IncF variants, were significantly associated with co-carriage of both AMR and VF genes, contributing to enhanced pathogenicity. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the emerging role of phylogroup A E. coli, traditionally commensal and AMR-rich as a leading cause of BSIs in India following the acquisition of virulence factors. In parallel, B2 clones like ST131 continue to drive infections through their established virulence and resistance repertoire. Such multi-replicon IncF plasmids driving AMR-VF co-selection, calls for focused surveillance and intervention in E. coli BSIs."
41276017,A national cohort study examined the risk of severe infection and infection-related mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease with lupus nephritis in comparison to other chronic kidney disease etiologies.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: The co-occurrence of lupus nephritis (LN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an excess risk of infection. However, it remains unknown whether the infection risk differs between LN with moderate and advanced CKD (LN-CKD) and other CKD etiologies. METHODS: Using data from the Swedish Renal registry 2006-2021, we identified 14,128 patients (median age 68 years, 64% men, median estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 ml/min per 1.73m(2)) that included 317 patients with LN-CKD, 783 patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) vasculitis , 8877 patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), 1855 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and 2296 patients with primary glomerular disease (PGD). Multivariable Poisson models and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to compare the risk of all-cause- and site-specific infection-related hospitalizations (including sepsis, respiratory-, genitourinary-, gastrointestinal related infections and infection of other/unspecified sites), and death due to infection, between patients with LN-CKD and the other CKD etiologies. RESULTS: In LN-CKD, the three-year absolute risks of all-cause infection-related hospitalization and death due to infection were 31% and 4% respectively. The risk of all-cause infection-hospitalization was higher in LN-CKD than in ANCA vasculitis but similar between LN-CKD and DKD. LN-CKD was associated with a higher risk of all-cause infection-related hospitalization and death due to infection than ADPDK (adjusted hazard ratio 1.46 [1.18-1.8] and 2.47 [1.35-4.5], respectively) and PGD (1.90 [1.54-2.34] and 2.97 [1.71- 5.18], respectively). The results were consistent across the site-specific infection-related hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LN exhibited a higher risk of severe infection compared to patients with ANCA vasculitis, ADPKD and PGD. LN-CKD and DKD had similar infection-risks. This highlights the need for prevention and tailored immunosuppressive therapy in the LN-population with CKD."
41275751,AI-driven rapid identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens in blood smears of septic patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacterial and 3 fungal species from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of blood samples from sepsis patients. METHOD: ology: A total of 16 637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. Novelty of our technological workflow lies in combination of the Cellpose 3 model for robust and precise segmentation of microbial cells, followed by Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for sophisticated and context-aware classification. This comprehensive approach allows effective analysis of complex image data, overcoming limitations of standard single-instance classification in heterogeneous samples. RESULTS: Our model achieved high classification accuracy: 77.15 % for bacteria and 71.39 % for fungi, with ROC AUC values of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. Most accurate results, reaching up to 96.2 %, were obtained for: Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Nakaseomyces glabratus. We observed some classification difficulties in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and within Candida albicans. KEY CONTRIBUTIONS: Despite these challenges, the study confirms the model's significant potential. Our approach achieves microscopy image-based diagnosis while reducing the microbial diagnostic time. By identifying specific bacteria or fungal infection species, this technique improves sepsis diagnosis and its subsequent treatment. This is a simple and accessible alternative to current laborious methods and achieves high performance in species-specific classification. These results indicate the benefits of using artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical diagnosis of sepsis."
41275300,Impact of a persuasive antimicrobial stewardship program on antibiotic use in patients admitted to emergency department for urinary tract infections: a multicentre prospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The spread of antibiotic resistance makes it necessary to implement Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Programs; the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an AMS program in the management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in emergency setting. METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was conducted enrolling all adult patients admitted to one of the 8 emergency departments participating in the study with a diagnosis of UTI from February 2023 to July 2024. Only one of the eight centers received a persuasive AMS program. The primary outcome evaluated was the prevalence of empirical antimicrobial prescription belonging to Access class according to WHO classification in AMS and non-AMS ED; secondary outcomes included the prevalence of etiologial diagnosis, the clinical response and seven-day and 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: During the study period, 657 patients were enrolled, 135 in the AMS and 522 in the non-AMS group, with a median age of 71 years (IQR 58-79). Patients in the AMS group had a more severe disease with a higher rate of sepsis or septic shock at admission (p < 0.001). In the AMS group, the percentage of patients with a microbiological diagnosis was higher (67% vs 43.1% p < 0.001); regarding empirical antibiotic therapy, drugs of the Access class were more frequently prescribed as empirical treatment in the AMS group (48.3 vs 37%, p = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of 7- and 30-day mortality and 7-day clinical response between the 2 groups, despite the higher severity of patients in the AMS group. CONCLUSIONS: In the centre where an AMS program was conducted, an increase in the number of positive urine cultures (67% vs 43.1%) has been observed, and a higher rate of prescriptions for Access class antibiotics. Further prospective data are needed to evaluate the impact of AMS intervention on antimicrobial prescribing in emergency setting."
41275087,"Prevalence, symptoms, risk factors and impact of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in emergency department patients: a case-control study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Global sepsis statistics exhibit a morbidity of 48.9 million with 11.0 million sepsis-related deaths. Despite ongoing research and guideline updates it remains a serious epidemiological concern. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the more dangerous sepsis complications, due to its potential to cause permanent central nervous system damage. This study aimed to examine the prevalence, symptoms, risk factors, and impact of SAE on disease course in emergency department patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in an emergency department of a university hospital. We analyzed medical records of patients from January 2021 till the end of December 2022. All admitted patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the sepsis-3 consensus were included. Patients with disseminated neoplastic disease, chronic neurological conditions with impact on cognitive and communicative functions, and pediatric patients were excluded. Based on laboratory tests and clinical symptoms of encephalopathy, the patients were divided into SAE and non-SAE groups. Chi-square test was used to assess results' significance. RESULTS: A total of 443 patients with sepsis were included in the study, of whom 240 presented with SAE. The most common SAE symptoms include general consciousness deterioration, disorientation, and somnolence. Patients with SAE were older and had heart failure more frequently. Mortality rate in the SAE group was significantly higher and equaled 45.42% vs 7.88% in the non-SAE group (p-value < 0.001). The most commonly identified pathogens in the blood cultures were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: The study showed that SAE is a common sepsis complication (54% prevalence) that significantly increases in-hospital mortality. Older patients with chronic neurological disorders and heart failure are particularly vulnerable. The SOFA, NEWS, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores have proven to be reliable predictors of SAE occurrence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is not a clinical trial."
41275079,Exploring vasopressin use in septic shock: a retrospective cohort study from Turkiye (VASCO-TURK).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vasopressin is a peptide hormone and often added to reduce catecholamine dose and side effects according to recent guidelines. Despite increasing global interest in vasopressin use in septic shock, real-world data from low- to middle-income countries, including Turkiye, remain scarce. MATERIAL-METHOD: This study was conducted as a single-center, retrospective, observational study in a tertiary intensive care unit, with the diagnosis of septic shock according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines and who received norepinephrine alone and both norepinephrine with vasopressin as an adjunctive vasopressor. RESULTS: A total of 146 septic shock patients were included in the study, with 113 (77.4%) in the norepinephrine group and 33 (22.6%) in the patients receiving adjunctive vasopressin therapy. Overall survival: 24.2% in adjunctive vasopressin group vs. 24.8% in norepinephrine group (p = 1.000). Median norepinephrine dose decreased significantly from 0.55 mcg/kg/min (IQR: 0.44-0.84) at baseline to 0.43 mcg/kg/min (IQR: 0.27-0.72) by the 6th hour (p = 0.010), supporting a vasopressor-sparing effect of vasopressin. Adjunctive vasopressin initiation time was 14 h (IQR 5-25 h), and the initial norepinephrine dose at the time of vasopressin introduction was, 0.56 mcg/kg/min (IQR 0.445-0.880). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), improved from 60 mmHg (IQR: 54-66) at hour 0 to 70 mmHg (IQR: 63.08-75.75) at hour 2 and 74 mmHg (IQR: 61.75-83.5) at hour 6 (p < 0.001). Heart rate initially remained stable between baseline and the 2nd hour (110 vs. 110 bpm), but decreased significantly by the 6th hour to a median of 97.5 bpm (IQR: 88.75-120.5; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This single center study, with a limited number of patients, is valuable as it reflects the first national experience with vasopressin. In this study, no difference in mortality was observed between patients receiving norepinephrine alone and those receiving vasopressin in combination with norepinephrine. Vasopressin demonstrated a significant norepinephrine-sparing effect, improved heart rate control, and increased mean arterial pressure, suggesting potential hemodynamic stabilization. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06953297). Public release date: April 23, 2025."
41275063,Antibiotic use in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy undergoing therapeutic hypothermia: time to rethink universal empirical treatment.,2025,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) can alter the immune system and may present symptoms similar to sepsis. This has led to widespread use of empirical antibiotics, despite limited evidence that support the need for universal empirical treatment. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of culture-proven sepsis and current antibiotic use patterns in neonates undergoing TH. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including term and near-term neonates with HIE treated with TH in two European NICUs with different antibiotic strategies: one with universal empirical antibiotics (Italy, n = 228) and one with selective use (Belgium, n = 74). We collected data on blood culture results, antibiotic exposure, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, PCT, leukocytes), and clinical outcomes. Of 302 newborns (276 term and 26 late preterm) who underwent TH, 278 (92%) received antibiotics at birth, with varying regimens for a median of 6 days. Blood cultures were performed in 228 Italian babies and in 72/74 Belgian infants (300 in total, equal to 99.3%), revealing only 2 cases of culture-confirmed early-onset sepsis (0.6%). In Belgium, all cultures from eight infants with clinical suspicion of sepsis were negative, resulting in a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 111 to prevent one confirmed infection. Late-onset sepsis occurred in four of 302 patients (1.3%). Biomarkers (CRP, PCT, leukocytes) fluctuated during cooling and rewarming but were not predictive of EOS. CONCLUSION: The incidence of confirmed early-onset sepsis in neonates with HIE undergoing TH was very low, despite extensive empirical antibiotic use. These findings question the necessity for routine universal empiric antibiotics and advocate for a selective risk-based approach based on clinical assessment. Careful monitoring and prudent antibiotic use are crucial to reduce unnecessary exposure and its potential harms in this vulnerable population. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Distinguishing the symptoms of HIE from those of EOS at birth or shortly thereafter is very complex, as they are often similar and can mimic one another. * Most newborns receiving hypothermic treatment are treated with empirical antibiotics in the suspicion of sepsis, even though the incidence of early-onset sepsis in the European healthcare context is very low. WHAT IS NEW: * Our multicentric study found a remarkably low incidence of confirmed EOS in newborns undergoing TH, irrespective of the antibiotic strategy used in each single center. * We provide data that can support a restriction on the use of empirical antibiotic therapy in neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, also considering the bacterial resistance that the imprudent use of antibiotics is turning into a global emergency."
41274972,"hsa_circ_0001818 regulates the function of macrophages in sepsis by inhibiting miR-17-3p, miR-433-3p, and miR-642a-5p.",2025,"Sepsis is a leading cause of death due to severe infections. Macrophages are important players in regulating the development of sepsis. Notably, hsa_circ_0001818 is highly expressed in the serum exosomes of sepsis patients and has shown potential as a diagnostic marker for the condition. However, its regulatory role in sepsis remains unclear. Here, we reported that hsa_circ_0001818 expression in macrophages is increased in sepsis. After hsa_circ_0001818 silencing, the apoptotic rate and release of inflammatory cytokines decreased, while phagocytic function of macrophages increased. In contrast, after hsa_circ_0001818 overexpression, the apoptotic rate and the release of inflammatory factors increased, whereas phagocytic function of macrophages decreased. In addition, mechanistic studies and rescue experiments confirmed that hsa_circ_0001818 adsorbs miR-17-3p, miR-433-3p, and miR-642a-5p as sponges, competitively inhibiting the expression of downstream target genes and regulating macrophage function. That is, hsa_circ_0001818 increased the apoptosis rate of macrophages through the miR-17-3p/caspase-3 (CASP3) axis, inhibited the phagocytic function of macrophages by adsorbing miR-433-3p and miR-642a-5p, and increased the secretion level of macrophage inflammatory factors by regulating the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 20 (ZBTB20)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) axis through miR-433-3p and miR-642a-5p. This study revealed the important role of hsa_circ_0001818 in sepsis and provided a new theoretical basis for the precise treatment of sepsis."
41273933,False-positive results of the turbidimetric beta-D-glucan assay in patients with bacteremia.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The presence of bacteremia is described as a cause of false-positive (FP) elevation of serum (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels measured with the Fungitell colorimetric assay. The experience with the increasingly used turbidimetric Wako BDG assay in this scenario is limited. METHODS: We recruited 58 patients with proven bacteremia and no clinical suspicion of invasive fungal disease between October 2022 and July 2023. Serum BDG was assessed by the Wako test in blood samples collected immediately upon the confirmation of blood culture positivity (median interval of 3 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2 - 5)). The positivity threshold was set at 7 pg/mL as per manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: The most common sources of bacteremia were urinary tract infection (27.6%) and intraabdominal or hepatobiliary infection (24.1%). Predominant pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%), Escherichia coli (22.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.5%). Most of the patients (91.4%) received a beta-lactam-containing regimen. A positive BDG assay was obtained in 5 patients, yielding a FP rate of 8.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.9 - 18.9). The median BDG was 8.6 pg/mL (IQR: 7-9 - 12.4). All but one patient had at least one alternative cause of FP results in the BDG assay, including hemodialysis, colitis, albumin therapy and gauze exposure. One patient with persistently elevated BDG levels was eventually diagnosed with Candida esophagitis. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of FP results with the turbidimetric BDG assay is uncommon, involves moderate reactivity and is typically accompanied by other potential causes of serum BDG elevation."
41273874,Artificial intelligence for mortality risk stratification in septic shock: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is associated with high mortality, making accurate risk stratification crucial for tailored treatment. Traditional clinical scoring systems are limited by static assessments and suboptimal accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential for dynamic and personalized prediction; however, its clinical utility requires rigorous evaluation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis specifically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of AI for mortality risk stratification in septic shock and compares their performance against traditional clinical scoring systems. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was performed across Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, covering studies up to September 17, 2025. Studies developing or validating AI for mortality risk stratification in adult septic shock patients were included. Quality was assessed using the PROBAST + AI. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 56,502 patients were included. AI achieved a pooled sensitivity of 0.65, specificity of 0.81, and an AUC of 0.80 (Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.77-0.84). Notably, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and support vector machines (SVM) achieved the highest AUC of 0.91. Compared to traditional clinical scoring systems, AI demonstrated significantly higher specificity (0.81 vs. 0.66, P < 0.05) and AUC (0.80 vs. 0.69, P < 0.05). The most frequently utilized algorithm was logistic regression. No significant performance difference was observed between internal and external validation sets (AUC 0.80 vs. 0.78, P > 0.05). Substantial heterogeneity existed among the included studies, potentially arising from variations in AI algorithms, number of centers, septic shock definitions, data sources, mortality endpoints, clinical departments, and data splitting methods. CONCLUSIONS: AI demonstrates promising discrimination and higher specificity than traditional clinical scoring systems. However, the evidence remains limited by substantial heterogeneity and potential bias,and its clinical utility requires further validation through prospective, multicenter studies."
41273847,STING-FSP1 signaling drives endothelial ferroptosis and vascular leakage in sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis-induced vascular endothelial injury, characterized by ferroptosis and barrier dysfunction, remains a major cause of mortality. This study investigates the role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) pathway in mediating endothelial ferroptosis during sepsis and explores therapeutic interventions. A murine sepsis model was established using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), along with LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). STING activation was modulated using inhibitor H-151 and siRNA silencing. Ferroptosis was assessed through lipid peroxidation (MDA, BODIPY C11), Fe(2+) accumulation (FerroOrange), and FSP1/GPX4 expression. Vascular permeability was quantified via Evans Blue extravasation and FITC-Dextran assays. STING activation in septic endothelial cells suppressed FSP1 expression, amplifying lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. CLP mice exhibited elevated vascular leakage, which H-151 reversed. STING inhibition restored FSP1 levels, reduced Fe(2+) overload, and preserved VE-cadherin integrity. FSP1 inhibition abolished these protective effects, confirming its necessity in STING-mediated ferroptosis. The STING/FSP1 axis exacerbates septic endothelial injury by driving ferroptosis. Targeting this pathway reduces oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction, highlighting its therapeutic potential for sepsis."
41273413,"Antimicrobial potency and additive effect of herbal antimicrobial compounds against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a causative agent of bacteremia.",2026,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa poses a significant threat in clinical settings, acting as a major causative agent of bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Intrinsic resistance of this bacterium necessitates the urgent need for novel anti-Pseudomonas agents. Current therapeutic strategies are becoming increasingly inadequate, emphasizing the importance of screening studies aimed at discovering new antimicrobials that can effectively target this resilient bacterium. In this context, the exploration of herbal remedies presents a promising avenue for the development of effective antimicrobial agents. Many herbs possess bioactive compounds with documented antimicrobial properties, which could serve as potential lead substances in the quest for new treatments against P. aeruginosa. In the current study, the effect of the aqueous extract of 38 plant tissues, which have been introduced as an antimicrobial plant in the available publications, was investigated on P. aeruginosa. This study was done on a standard strain which is known as causative agent of bacteremia to find new avenues against P. aeruginosa bacteremia. Extracts from flower buds of S. aromaticum, flower of P. granatum L. var. pleniflora, and fruit of R. coriaria were found as effective against P. aeruginosa. Combination effect of these extracts was primarily evaluated by double well synergy test, and it was found that P. granatum and R. coriaria extracts may have additive or synergistic antimicrobial effect. More evaluations were performed via checkerboard assay. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated as 0.84 which fall within the additive range (0.5 < FICI </= 1). These results suggest that the combination of P. granatum and R. coriaria extracts can provide a promising natural mixture with enhanced antimicrobial efficacy to treat P. aeruginosa bacteremia. So, it can be concluded that mixed extract is a valuable source of natural anti-Pseudomonas compounds which can be subjected for further studies regarding toxicity and formulation."
41272676,"Immune cell dynamics, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): a multiparametric analysis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a complex and multifactorial life-threatening reaction triggered by trauma or infection (sepsis). Since the dynamics of immune cells, cytokines and novel markers such as circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) remain incompletely elucidated, we aimed to provide a comprehensive multiparametric characterization of this severe response, to identify potential prognostic and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We conducted a multiparametric and sequential quantification of up to 25 immune cell circulating populations using next-generation flow cytometry, assessed plasma cytokine levels with Luminex technology, and the characterized and quantified EVs and their microRNA content. Peripheral blood samples were taken at 0, 24 and 72 h after SIRS onset from 25 patients with polytrauma-induced SIRS (PT group) and 25 developed SIRS from other origins, such as pulmonary or urinary infections (NP-denoting non-polytrauma group). Samples from 21 healthy donors (HD) were analysed as a control group. Statistical analyses were performed to compare experimental groups (PT, NP, HD) and to evaluate correlations between experimental findings and patients' outcomes for potential prognostic markers discovery. RESULTS: SIRS patients exhibited increased leukocyte counts driven by neutrophil mobilization combined with a reduction of dendritic cells and lymphocytes early after the SIRS. The PT group showed an increase in classical monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and mesenchymal stromal cells compared to HD. These dynamics occurred alongside substantial chemokine release, including IL-8, G-CSF, CCL2 in both SIRS groups, MIF in PT and CCL4 in NP. Both SIRS groups experienced a pronounced cytokine storm with simultaneous release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased of plasma EV levels. Our findings suggest that elevated IL-8 concentrations and increased counts of circulating monocytes and MDSCs are associated with worse prognosis and may serve as valuable prognostic indicators in SIRS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the dynamic kinetics of multiple cell subsets, cytokines and EVs during SIRS, highlighting differences between SIRS initiated by polytrauma versus non-polytrauma events and identifying correlations between biological findings and patient outcomes."
41272557,Prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers and Phoenix criteria in pediatric sepsis: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of cardiac biomarkers at admission on the prognosis and timing of vasoactive drug administration in children with sepsis according to the 2005 SIRS criteria. Additionally, the Phoenix sepsis criteria have been applied to patients and examined in detail. METHODS: The study was conducted as a single-center retrospective study between March 2019 and 2022. Laboratory parameters and echocardiographic measurements at admission were evaluated. The primary outcomes are mortality and vasoactive drug use. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the time to initiate vasoactive drugs. RESULTS: In this study 162 (45.1% females) children with sepsis were included. The total mortality was 26.4%. Among the 162 patients, 28.6% were not classified as having sepsis according to the Phoenix 4 criteria and 24.2% according to the Phoenix 8 criteria. Among the non-surviving patients, 9.3% were not classified as sepsis according to the Phoenix 4 criteria (p = 0.001) and 7% according to the Phoenix 8 criteria (p = 0.002). ROC analysis revealed that a pro-BNP value of >/= 1835 ng/L predicted the initiation of vasoactive therapy with 73.1% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory parameters such as pro-BNP obtained in the early stages of the disease could serve as good guides for in determining the timing of initiation of vasoactive drug therapy. Furthermore, the fact that children who died did not meet the Phoenix sepsis criteria raises concerns about the ability of these criteria to detect sepsis at an early stage."
41270997,Endothelial protein C receptor CD201 is a better marker than stem cell antigen-1 to identify mouse long-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells following septic challenge.,2026,"Stem cell antigen-1 (SCA1) is widely used to identify mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) among lineage-negative KIT(+) (LK) cells. However, SCA1 is expressed only in a few inbred mouse strains and becomes strongly upregulated in LK cells following in vivo challenge with interferons, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or pathogens, leading to incorrect analysis of HSC functional subsets and delineation of HSC, MPP, and lineage-restricted progenitor phenotypes. Endothelial protein C receptor CD201 can be used as an alternative marker for mouse and even human HSC. However, whether CD201 expression changes following infectious challenge is unknown. Unlike SCA1, CD201 expression did not change on mouse LK cells in response to LPS in vivo. Long-term competitive transplantations with CD201(+), CD201(-), or SCA1(+) LK cells showed that most reconstituting HSCs are within the LK CD201(+) population after LPS challenge. However, the long-term competitive repopulation potential of LK SCA1(+) cells from LPS-treated mice was much more severely reduced than that of LK CD201(+) cells from the same LPS-treated donors, suggesting that the LK SCA1(+) population in challenged donors becomes contaminated with CD201(-) progenitors devoid of long-term repopulation potential. Based on the CD201 gating strategy, we reassessed the effect of LPS on HSC and MPP cycling and mobilization and their dependency on MY88 and TRIF adaptors. In conclusion, CD201 enables a more accurate analysis of mouse HSC and MPP subsets in all inbred strains in septic conditions or steady state."
41270863,Antimicrobial resistance in blood culture proven sepsis in outborn and inborn neonates.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, representing a critical emergency that demands swift diagnosis and intervention. Recent trend shows increasing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the antimicrobial resistance pattern in blood culture positive neonatal sepsis in outborn and inborn neonates and to compare the clinical profile in neonates with proven sepsis. METHODS: Bacterial cultures of the blood samples received from neonates with suspected sepsis was performed and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of blood culture positive neonates was done. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were done as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2023 guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 100 participants, 34 were early onset neonatal sepsis and 66 were late onset neonatal sepsis. 35 % of the delivery were vaginal whereas 65 % of the deliveries were by Caesarean section. 17 % of the total neonates delivered had to undergo neonatal resuscitation and 36 % of the neonates had birth asphyxia. The most commonly isolated organisms were Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CoNS) (30 %) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii complex (20 %). 45.1 % were Extended Spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producers and 58 % were AmpC beta lactamases producers. Case fatality rate was highest with Klebsiella pneumoniae i.e. 34.6 % followed by Acinetobacter baumannii complex i.e. 23.07 %. CONCLUSION: Increase in antibiotic resistance organisms can lead to an increase in the neonatal case fatality rate (CFR), so regular surveillance is needed. Comparison between the resistance profile between inborn and outborn neonates provides an insight into the difference in the variety of organisms isolated and also the difference in resistance shown by community acquired and hospital acquired organisms."
41270642,Inhibition of AKR1C3 attenuates sepsis-induced acute liver injury by blocking the TRAF6/NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,2026,"Acute liver injury (ALI), a life-threatening complication of sepsis in critically ill patients, remains a significant clinical challenge with limited therapeutic options. While Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3 (AKR1C3), a key regulator of inflammatory and immune responses, has emerged as a critical regulator in sepsis progression, its functional role and molecular mechanisms in sepsis-induced ALI remain poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of AKR1C3 inhibition and elucidate its underlying mechanisms in ALI pathogenesis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis murine model, we observed significant upregulation of AKR1C3 protein expression in liver tissues, correlating with disease severity. Pharmacological inhibition of AKR1C3 dramatically ameliorated CLP-induced hepatic pathological damage, restored liver function biomarkers, and attenuated systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, AKR1C3 suppression inhibited hepatocyte pyroptosis by blocking NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release via inactivation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Further molecular studies revealed that AKR1C3 potentiates NF-kappaB activity by interacting with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and enhancing its ubiquitination, thereby facilitating downstream inflammatory cascades. Collectively, our findings identify the AKR1C3/TRAF6/NF-kappaB axis as a novel regulatory pathway driving sepsis-associated ALI and propose AKR1C3 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for this critical condition."
41270576,Investigation of Streptococcus agalactiae Colonisation in pregnant women using culture and a novel qPCR Kit.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Maternal colonisation with Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is the most important risk factor for early-onset sepsis in newborns. We aimed to determine the rate of GBS colonisation in pregnant women evaluate the concordance between culture and a novel commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for screening. We also aimed to investigate the presence of the hypervirulent ST-17 clone and the potential risk factors that may affect colonisation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 365 rectovaginal samples from pregnant women >/=36 weeks were investigated. Lim Broth was used for culture. PCR was done by the Bio-Speedy GBS (Group B Streptococcus) qPCR kit. The presence of the hypervirulent ST-17 clone was evaluated by PCR. Potential risk factors were evaluated via a survey. RESULTS: GBS was detected in 12.3 % (95 % CI: 9.3-16.1) of pregnant women by culture, in 15.3 % (95 % CI: 11.9-19.5) by direct qPCR and in 19.5 % (95 % CI: 15.6-23.9) by enrichment qPCR. Cohen's Kappa analysis revealed an 'almost perfect' level of agreement between culture and direct qPCR (kappa = 0.85; 95 % CI: 0.74-0.97). Discordant results were observed in 13 cases (12 qPCR positive / culture negative, and one qPCR-negative / culture-positive). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, while resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin were 37.8 % (95 % CI 25.1-52.4) and 33.3 % (95 % CI 21.4-47.9), respectively. ST-17 clone constituted 7 % (95 % CI:1.9-17.0) of the positive samples. GBS colonisation showed an association with sexual activity that approached the statistical significance threshold, and a significant association with education level. CONCLUSION: Using a novel PCR test, almost perfect agreement was found between qPCR and culture, while the detection of colonisation was higher by qPCR. This study highlights the diagnostic contribution of molecular methods in GBS screening, even providing results after the onset of labor. The high prevalence of GBS, along with the circulation of hypervirulent clones underscores the critical importance of routine screening in pregnant women."
41270563,Infrared pupillometry to measure pupil light reflex in awake cats: Feasibility and evaluation pre- and post-opioid administration.,2026,"Assessing pupil diameter and pupillary light reflexes (PLR) in a clinical setting can be challenging due to the pupil's sensitivity to light and the rapid nature of these reflexes. Pupillometry is a technique that is helpful in human medicine in anesthesiology and critical care medicine. However, evidence in veterinary medicine is scarce on the application of pupillometry and analgesic response. Therefore, the aim of this pilot observational study was to assess the feasibility and reliability of portable pupillometry in cats, identify individual factors influencing pupillometric parameters, and compare measurements before and after analgesic administration. Twenty-eight cats, including healthy and hospitalized sick cats, underwent pupillometry using a Neurolight(R) device. Pupil diameter, PLR parameters, and 4 A-VET pain score were measured before and after opioid administration. Test-retest reliability was evaluated, and the influence of factors was analyzed using multivariate models. Pupillometry was feasible in 97 % of cats, with measurements being easier in hospitalized sick cats. Good reliability was observed for pupil diameter measurements, while PLR parameters showed poor reliability. Weight was significantly associated with pupil size, potentially due to the relationship between body weight and eyeball size. No association was found between pain scores and pupil diameter, and no significant changes in pupil size were observed after opioid administration. In conclusion, portable pupillometry using the Neurolight(R) is feasible in cats and provides reliable pupil diameter measurements. However, the device is not suitable for objective PLR assessment in this species. Further studies are needed to better understand the factors influencing pupillometry measurements in cats."
41269521,"Epidemiology of Invasive Escherichia coli Disease in Adults Using Routine Healthcare Records from the United States, 2002-2022.",2026,"INTRODUCTION: Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli can infect normally sterile body sites, causing invasive E. coli disease (IED). The IED burden is often underestimated. Here, we provide more insights into the real-world epidemiology of IED in the United States from 2002 to 2022. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a narrow and a broad algorithm composed of coded diagnoses combined with laboratory data (microbiology culture) were first validated against the gold-standard IED case definition. The algorithms were selected to identify IED cases among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Northwest database. IED incidence rates (IRs) and case fatality rates (CFRs) were calculated and stratified by period, age, and sex. The risk of IED in the population with pre-defined comorbidities, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), was assessed using incidence rate ratios. RESULTS: A source population of 1,163,319 and 1,169,224 persons was identified by the narrow and broad algorithms, respectively. In these populations, 5832 (narrow algorithm) and 10,490 (broad algorithm) IED cases were identified, corresponding to an IED IR of 80.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.8-83.0) and 145.8 (143.0-148.6) cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The IR was higher among females than males and increased with age and over time. All-cause mortality among cases at 30 days after IED diagnosis was 7.6% (95% CI: 6.9-8.3%) and 7.2% (6.7-7.7%) based on the narrow and broad algorithms, respectively, and CFRs increased with age to 13.1% (both algorithms) among >/= 80-year-olds. Having a history of UTIs was confirmed as an independent risk factor, multiplying the risk of IED by more than five compared to the population without a history of UTIs. CONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that IED is a substantial and growing global health concern that disproportionally affects older adults."
41269027,Comparison of the time to detection (TTD) of different blood culture systems and antibiotic adsorption capacity of different pediatric blood culture bottles of BD and bioMerieux.,2026,"We evaluated the time to detection (TTD) of pediatric blood culture bottles (BacT/Alert-PF, BacT/Alert-PF plus, and Bactec-PF) and instruments (BacT/Alert 3D, BacT/Alert VIRTUO, and Bactec FX) via in vitro simulations of bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections. We also assessed the antibiotic adsorption capacity of the three pediatric bottles under simulated peak antibiotic concentrations. Among all tested bacteria, the median TTDs for BacT/Alert VIRTUO with BacT/Alert-PF plus and for Bactec FX with Bactec-PF were 11.62 h and 13.48 h, respectively, both of which are shorter than those of BacT/Alert 3D with BacT/Alert-PF (17.25 h). Within the BacT/Alert 3D system, BacT/Alert-PF plus demonstrated a shorter median TTD than BacT/Alert-PF (13.92 h vs 17.25 h). Under identical bottle conditions (BacT/Alert-PF plus), BacT/Alert VIRTUO achieved a shorter median TTD than BacT/Alert 3D (11.62 h vs 13.92 h). In the antibiotic adsorption evaluation, Bactec-PF (51.3%) and BacT/Alert-PF plus (46.1%) achieved significantly higher detection rates than BacT/Alert-PF (13%) for ampicillin, oxacillin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin, and vancomycin. The detection rates of Bactec-PF and BacT/Alert-PF plus varied by antibiotic-strain combination and increased with the level of bacterial resistance. All three bottles achieved 100% detection in the amikacin group, whereas the detection rates were 0% in the ceftriaxone and meropenem groups. These findings provide important guidance for selecting blood culture systems in patients who have received prior antibiotic therapy and for improving the prognosis of bloodstream infections. IMPORTANCE: Rapid reporting of positive blood cultures can directly influence physicians' treatment decisions, thereby reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. This study compared the time to detection (TTD) and antibiotic adsorption capacity of commonly used pediatric blood culture bottles and instruments, which are currently less evaluated. Providing optimized testing options for blood culture is essential to shorten the TTD and improve culture positivity rates in patients who have already received antibiotics."
41268563,A case report on severe atypical bullous erysipelas induced by Escherichia coli in an immunosuppressed individual.,2025,"A 60-year-old female patient with a prolonged history of immunosuppression due to a 20-year condition of rheumatoid arthritis, managed with long-term glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, developed atypical erysipelas caused by Escherichia coli, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Clinically, she presented with abrupt onset of redness, swelling, warmth, and pain in the left lower limb, which rapidly evolved into multiple vesicles and blood-filled blisters (2-3 cm in diameter) with rupture and exudation within 24 hours, subsequently progressing to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Both vesicle fluid culture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood samples confirmed the presence of Escherichia coli. Following the initial ineffective treatment with cefuroxime, the regimen was escalated to meropenem in combination with teicoplanin. Upon confirmation of the pathogenic microorganism, the treatment was de-escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam within 24 hours, supplemented by comprehensive wound management (iodophor wet dressing, lithospermum oil application, and red light therapy) and organ support therapy. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient recovered, and the wound healed completely after 4 months of care. This case underscores three critical warnings: 1) the pathogen spectrum of erysipelas in immunosuppressed hosts shows a significant shift, necessitating vigilance against the possibility of Gram-negative bacterial infections, such as Escherichia coli; 2) atypical bullous skin lesions can serve as an early indicator of severe infection, with a rapid clinical course progressing to shock within 24 hours; 3) a tiered anti-infective strategy is paramount - initially broad-spectrum coverage for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams plus glycopeptides), followed by de-escalation within 24 hours of pathogen identification. It is advisable to conduct early combined microbial culture and NGS testing for immunosuppressed patients presenting with skin infections, and to implement individualized broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens to enhance prognosis."
41268561,Decoding immune low-response states in sepsis: single-cell and 3D spatial transcriptomic insights into immunoparalysis.,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of critical illness worldwide. Despite advances in supportive care, durable benefit from immune-directed therapies is limited, reflecting heterogeneity with immune low-response states ('immunoparalysis') across innate and adaptive compartments. In this review we summarize advances from single-cell RNA and ATAC profiling, immune-repertoire assays and 3D spatial transcriptomics that resolve monocyte, dendritic-cell (cDC1, cDC2 and pDC), lymphocyte and NK-cell programs, and appraise translational opportunities spanning endotype-guided risk stratification, pharmacodynamic monitoring and spatial biomarkers. We also discuss enduring challenges-including assay standardization, harmonized thresholds for monocyte HLA-DR and whole-blood stimulation, and limited availability of clinically compatible spatial platforms-that temper implementation. By integrating bedside function (HLA-DR trajectories, LPS-induced cytokine capacity) with single-cell endotypes (MS1/HLA-DR;low S100A;high monocytes, dendritic-cell attrition, checkpoint-biased T cells) and host-pathogen topology from FFPE-ready spatial assays, emerging strategies aim to restore antigen presentation, reconstitute priming, disrupt inhibitory myeloid-lymphoid circuits and prevent secondary infection. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of immunoparalysis-informed precision medicine in sepsis and outlines pragmatic standards for composite biomarkers, patient selection and on-therapy decision rules. We hope these insights will assist investigators and clinicians as they endeavor to convert descriptive immune low-response states into tractable, reversible clinical entities."
41268065,Multi-Dimensional Characterization of Programmed Cell Death Patterns for Prognostic Stratification and Therapeutic Insights in Sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome characterized by dysregulated immune responses and multiple forms of programmed cell death (PCD). Comprehensive understanding of the PCD landscape may provide insights into prognosis and therapeutic targets, whereas its role in sepsis is not well-explored. METHODS: Using the microarray dataset for sepsis (GSE65682), we systematically profiled 14 PCD patterns in sepsis and stratified patients into molecular subtypes with distinct immune landscapes and clinical outcomes. PCD-related prognostic signature was developed and validated across multiple cohorts. Single-cell and multi-organ transcriptomic analyses were conducted to elucidate cellular heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Molecular docking was used to explore interactions between active compounds of Simiao Yongan Decoction (SMYAD) and key PCD-related proteins. RESULTS: Two clusters with differential transcriptional programs and immune infiltration patterns were identified, in which Cluster 1 showed poorer prognosis. We then developed a seven-gene signature (ELANE, CTSG, MPO, CAMP, TFRC, IL1B, CASP5) that effectively stratified patients by survival outcomes, with robust predictive performance across independent datasets. Neutrophils, monocytes, plasma, and dendritic cells were major mediators of PCD-associated immune dysregulation, in which neutrophils showing the strongest response. Temporal transcriptomics revealed peak expression of prognostic genes in bone marrow and peripheral blood within three days post-onset, suggesting an early therapeutic window. Finally, molecular docking indicated that SMYAD compounds may target PCD proteins (MPO, ELANE, IL1B) and modulate immune responses. CONCLUSION: This study delineates the multi-dimensional role of PCD in sepsis, establishes a reliable prognostic model with strong predictive value, and highlights SMYAD as a potential multi-target therapy. These findings provide new avenues for risk stratification and suggest the promise of integrating PCD biology with adjunctive immunomodulatory strategies."
41267877,Early prediction of sepsis-induced coagulopathy in the ICU using interpretable machine learning: a multi-center retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a fatal complication in ICU patients, yet early risk prediction remains challenging. This study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning model for predicting SIC within seven days of ICU admission. METHODS: Clinical data for model development were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Feature selection was performed using three distinct algorithms: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE), and the Boruta method. Ten machine learning models underwent training employing 5-fold cross-validation on the training subset, with subsequent evaluation on the validation subset encompassing discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility metrics. The optimal model underwent further interpretability analysis through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate variable contributions and their directional effects. External validation was then conducted using the electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Finally, the best-performing model was implemented as a web-based Shiny application featuring an interactive interface. RESULTS: Among 10,740 patients in MIMIC-IV, 2,232 (20.78%) developed SIC within 7 days post-ICU admission. A LightGBM model with thirteen variables demonstrated optimal performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.885 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.874-0.897) in the internal validation set and 0.831 (95% CI: 0.819-0.843) in the external eICU-CRD cohort. Key predictive variables included Prothrombin Time-International Normalization Ratio (INR), platelet count, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), lactate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), red cell distribution width (RDW), bicarbonate, phosphate, hemoglobin, age, the presence of heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD) and the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The model was deployed as a clinician-oriented web application providing an accessible interface (https://shatao.shinyapps.io/Sepsis_Induced_Coagulopathy/). CONCLUSION: This model demonstrated strong predictive ability and clinical interpretability, enabling early SIC identification and targeted intervention."
41267800,The Impact of Endogenous Hydrogen Sulfide on Bacterial Resistance.,2025,"Infectious diseases, especially sepsis from bacterial infections, significantly threaten global health, with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) complicating treatment and increasing clinical burdens. Antibiotic overuse contributes to AMR by creating selective pressure, reducing the efficacy of traditional therapies, and necessitating new approaches. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a gaseous signaling molecule produced by most bacteria through cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), plays a crucial role in bacterial resistance. This review explores the biological functions of bacterial endogenous H(2)S and its impact on AMR. H(2)S enhances resistance by neutralizing antibiotic-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage, and promoting biofilm formation, which obstructs antibiotic penetration and facilitates resistance gene exchange. Furthermore, enhancing H(2)S-based assays could significantly improve the diagnosis of AMR. Additionally, strategies such as targeting H(2)S metabolism-through the use of H(2)S synthase inhibitors or disrupting biofilms via H(2)S clearance-or the combination of H(2)S synthase inhibitors with antibiotics, may reverse resistance. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which H(2)S mediates resistance is essential for the development of advanced diagnostic tools and innovative therapies to combat AMR. Its clinical translation may reverse AMR passivity, guide antibiotic sensitizer development, and optimize therapies, holding significant clinical and translational value."
41267510,Retrospective Comparison of Outcomes From Septic Peritonitis of Gastrointestinal Versus Non-Gastrointestinal Etiology in Dogs (2009-2022): 161 Cases.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare characteristics and outcomes of dogs with gastrointestinal (GI) and non-gastrointestinal (non-GI) causes of septic peritonitis. DESIGN: Retrospective study from 2009 to 2022. SETTING: A Midwest veterinary teaching hospital and a West Coast private practice in the United States. ANIMALS: A total of 161 dogs diagnosed with septic peritonitis based on intracellular bacteria or a positive culture from peritoneal effusion. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 161 dogs included in the study, 114 (70.8%) survived. Dogs that survived were younger (p = 0.011) and, compared with nonsurvivors, had higher total plasma protein (TP) concentrations (p = 0.039), higher serum albumin concentrations (p = 0.0021), and higher systolic blood pressures (SBP) (p = 0.0025) on presentation. Plasma lactate concentration on presentation was not associated with survival (p = 0.097). There was no difference in survival between dogs diagnosed with a GI versus non-GI etiology of septic peritonitis. Dogs with GI etiologies weighed more than dogs with non-GI etiologies (p = 0.0169). There were no differences in age, temperature, heart rate, SBP, PCV, TP, serum blood glucose concentration, plasma lactate concentration, serum albumin concentration, or Acute Patient Physiologic and Laboratory Evaluation-fast scores upon presentation in dogs with GI etiologies compared with dogs with non-GI etiologies. In a subgroup analysis, dogs with hepatobiliary etiologies were older (p = 0.0004) and weighed less (p = 0.003) compared with dogs with GI and other non-hepatobiliary etiologies, but there was no difference in survival (p = 0.958). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no difference in survival to discharge in dogs with GI compared with non-GI etiologies of septic peritonitis. Regardless of the etiology of septic peritonitis, age, TP, serum albumin concentration, and SBP upon presentation were significantly associated with survival."
41266989,Analysis of prognostic risk factors in critically ill elderly patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the risk factors influencing the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) Ⅳ database collected between 2008 and 2019. A total of 3,338 elderly patients with SA-AKI were included and categorized into a survival group (n = 2,448) and a death group (n = 898) based on 28-day mortality outcomes. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was utilized to identify potential predictors, and multivariate Cox regression was employed to analyze independent risk factors associated with 28-day mortality in elderly patients with SA-AKI. RESULTS: The 28-day mortality rate in elderly patients with SA-AKI was 26.9%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age >/= 76 years (Hazard Ratio[HR] = 1.392, 95% Confidence Interval[CI] 1.212-1.598, P < 0.001), creatinine >/= 1.5 mg/dL (HR = 1.216, 95%CI 1.037-1.427, P = 0.016), urea-to-creatinine ratio (UCR) >/= 20 (HR = 1.668, 95%CI 1.441-1.931, P < 0.001), liver disease (HR = 1.292, 95%CI 1.059-1.575, P = 0.011), renal replacement therapy (HR = 1.476, 95%CI 1.160-1.879, P = 0.002), use of norepinephrine (HR = 1.624, 95%CI 1.390-1.896, P < 0.001), dobutamine (HR = 1.644, 95%CI 1.225-2.206, P < 0.001), dopamine (HR = 1.260, 95%CI 1.008-1.576, P = 0.042), and vasopressin (HR = 1.708, 95%CI 1.430-2.041, P < 0.001) were significant risk factors for 28-day mortality in elderly patients with SA-AKI. In contrast, epinephrine use was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.553, 95%CI 0.417-0.734, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly SA-AKI patients have a high short-term mortality. Advanced age, renal impairment, liver disease, renal replacement therapy, and the use of several vasoactive drugs were associated with poor outcomes, while the potential benefit of epinephrine requires further validation. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41266700,Knowledge gaps in extracorporeal blood purification: what would be required for its successful application in septic shock?,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that results in organ dysfunction. Extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) therapies traditionally aim to remove circulating mediators involved in this pathological response, although novel technologies that can remove cells and even living pathogens have recently been developed. Despite their growing clinical use, robust evidence supporting EBP in septic shock as an adjuvant therapy is lacking, and several knowledge gaps hinder their effective and safe application. This narrative review critically examines these gaps from both mechanistic and clinical perspectives. Key issues include the dynamic and compartmentalized nature of the immune response, the unclear roles of specific cytokines, and the potential removal of protective anti-inflammatory mediators. Broad-spectrum adsorption may induce unintended immunomodulatory effects, including desorption and altered leukocyte trafficking. Selective approaches, such as endotoxin removal with polymyxin B hemoadsorption, face challenges related to dose, patient stratification, and the limitations of endotoxin activity assays. Therapeutic plasma exchange offers the potential to restore homeostasis but raises questions regarding optimal regimens, replacement fluids, and the risk of unintended drug clearance. The heterogeneity of trial designs, insufficient patient phenotyping, and variability in treatment protocols have led to inconclusive or conflicting clinical outcomes, including some trials suggesting potential harm. This review underscores the need for better mechanistic understanding, real-time immune monitoring, and ideally targeted clinical trial designs to define which patients might benefit from EBP and when. Ultimately, the path to effective application of EBP in sepsis lies in individualized therapy guided by immune profiling, biomarker-driven stratification, and rigorous evaluation in high-quality randomized controlled trials."
41265525,"A molecular snapshot of clinical extra-intestinal Escherichia coli strains in South India - Virulence factors, phylogrouping and resistance trends.",2026,"INTRODUCTION: E. coli is a frequently encountered clinical pathogen, and periodic monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiles is crucial for defining roadmaps for both infection prevention and control practices. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the proportions of key phylogenetic groups, virulence associated genes (VAGs), and antimicrobial susceptibility (AST) patterns of E. coli isolated from various clinical samples and compare expression levels of key VAGs in patients with uncomplicated UTI versus those with UTI + bacteraemia in a tertiary-care hospital in South India. METHODS: Clinical E. coli isolates, confirmed using the MALDI-TOF MS, and satisfying the National Healthcare Safety Network(NHSN) criteria for infections were included. Phylogenetic grouping and VAGs detection were performed using multiplex-PCR and targeted gene expression was carried out using quantitative RT-qPCR. AST was determined using VITEK 2 system. RESULTS: The included 288E. coli isolates (144 from bacteraemia and non-bacteraemia cases each) predominately showed phylogroup B2 (52 %), followed by D (23 %), and most prevalent virulence genes were chuA (74.7 %), fimH(63.3 %), traT(63.2 %), and kpsMTII(54.2 %). fimH, fyuA, and hlyD were significantly associated with bacteraemia, and gene expression of these genes and the analysis demonstrated that hlyD expression was significantly higher (p = 0.012) in UTI + bacteraemia patients when compared to patients with uncomplicated UTI. Phylogroup B2 carried the highest median number of VAGs (7), followed by D (6). Highest susceptibility was towards tigecycline (99.7 %), followed by amikacin (91.7 %) and meropenem (90.0 %). CONCLUSION: We focused on prevalent virulent genes and their expression, leading to bacteraemia, providing a comprehensive overview of an existing concern. Focusing on bacterial gene expression along with integrated surveillance of antimicrobial resistance helps in designing further research so that strategies can be planned that will later help in early risk stratification and informed clinical decision-making to prevent severe complications including secondary bacteraemia and other severe patient morbidities."
41264604,Outcome of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP) is the most common chronic lung disease in infants. The study aimed to evaluate the outcome of infants diagnosed with BPD in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of infants with BPD born between January 2015 and December 2020 at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Surviving children were invited for clinical assessment and echocardiogram. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Among 8,490 newborns hospitalized in the Perinatal ward, 100 (1.2%) developed BPD, with neonatal sepsis and congenital heart disease as the most prevalent comorbidities. Of the 85 infants with complete data, 41 (48.2%) died within 7 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that post-menstrual age (PMA) < 28 weeks and mechanical ventilation as independent predictors of mortality, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% CI) of 5.27 (1.36-20.43) and 0.26 (0.09-0.75), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the infants diagnosed with BPD died within the first seven months of life. PMA < 28 weeks was associated with increased mortality risk, while mechanical ventilation showed a protective effect against mortality in infants with BPD."
41263932,Trajectories of Recovery after ACutE and cRitical illness (TRACER): a prospective observational study protocol.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Patients who survive admission to intensive care unit (ICU) for critical illness are at high risk of developing muscle atrophy and weakness, commonly diagnosed as ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW). The development of ICUAW is closely linked to long-term symptoms and impairments known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Despite heightened recognition of impairments, there is limited research supporting effective interventions to improve muscle and physical outcomes after hospital discharge. Prior to developing and testing interventions for ICU survivors, it is imperative to understand the trajectory of muscle and physical function recovery following an ICU stay. The purpose of this study is to longitudinally investigate skeletal muscle health and physical function outcomes after ICU admission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a single site, prospective, observational study in adult patients who have survived a critical illness (ie, sepsis or acute respiratory failure). Patients will participate in a battery of testing including primary outcomes: muscle power and physical function; and secondary outcomes: muscle strength, muscle size, endurance and physical activity (by accelerometry) at hospital discharge and 3, 6, and 12 months post-discharge. A subset of patients will participate in muscle biopsy and venipuncture. To examine if the trajectory of recovery predicts primary outcomes, we will perform multivariate linear regression models in 150 evaluable patients. To examine differences in molecular and cellular outcomes in plasma and muscle tissue, a control group of community-dwelling adults without history of an ICU stay will be enrolled as a comparator group. Enrolment started on 18 October 2022 with an estimated completion date of 1 August 2027. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the University of Kentucky Office of Research Integrity Medical Internal Review Board (# 77407), with patients providing informed written consent. We anticipate our findings to establish recovery trajectories, improving the classification of patients who experience sustained physical disability. Improved identification of recovery trajectories of muscle and physical function enables future studies to employ an individually targeted rehabilitation approach, that is, precision medicine, with the goal of improving patient outcomes. The cellular findings will support the development of novel interventions specifically designed for detecting underlying mechanisms. We intend to disseminate findings to patients, healthcare professionals, the public and other relevant groups via conference presentations and manuscripts without publication restrictions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05537298."
41263555,Thyroid hormone deficiency worsens outcomes in vaccinia virus infection.,2025,"Intranasal inhalation of the vaccinia virus in mice leads to acute lung infection followed by peripheral organ damage. Our findings demonstrate that hypothyroidism significantly exacerbates disease severity. Hypothyroid mice exhibit higher disease scores, elevated lung viral loads, and more extensive tissue damage in both the lungs and peripheral organs. Notably, only hypothyroid mice reach the experimental endpoint, underscoring their heightened vulnerability. Hypothyroid mice display a defective splenic immune response, with no amplification of T and B lymphocytes, but the increased susceptibility to vaccinia virus infection also persists in hypothyroid lymphocyte-deficient Rag2(-/-) mice. Prior to infection, hypothyroid mice show a reduced pool of lung alveolar macrophages, and lung viral loads are significantly elevated in these animals as early as 1 day post-infection, suggesting that an impaired innate immune response is involved in their increased susceptibility to vaccinia virus. Indeed, transfer of primary alveolar macrophages into the alveolar macrophage-deficient lungs of hypothyroid mice significantly alleviates disease symptoms. In euthyroid mice, circulating thyroid hormone levels decrease during infection, a well-documented response in sepsis and critical illness, known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Further highlighting the link between thyroid hormones and immune defense, we show that SRT1720, a Sirtuin 1 activator, reduces thyroid hormone levels and also worsens vaccinia infection when administered to euthyroid mice. In summary, our study reveals that hypothyroidism aggravates vaccinia virus infection. While the role of thyroid hormone decline in various diseases remains a topic of debate, our results suggest that thyroid hormones play a protective role in viral pulmonary infections.IMPORTANCEVaccinia virus serves both as a recombinant vaccine platform and as a model for studying human smallpox and monkeypox infections, which are associated with high mortality rates. Here, we show that hypothyroidism in mice aggravates the severity of vaccinia virus infection due to a deficient splenic immune response and to a marked reduction in lung alveolar macrophages, a key cell population in defense against respiratory pathogens. Intratracheal administration of primary alveolar macrophages improves disease symptoms during the early phase of infection in hypothyroid animals. Hypothyroidism also impairs the amplification of splenic lymphocytes, which play a key role in defense against viral infection. Furthermore, vaccinia virus infection reduces thyroid hormone levels in euthyroid mice, a phenomenon named ""non-thyroidal illness syndrome"" that often occurs in septic patients, suggesting that, in the context of viral pulmonary infections, thyroid hormone replacement might be a useful therapeutic option."
41263458,Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy in Pediatric Sepsis and MIS-C: Comparative Efficacy of Oxiris and Conventional Filters.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: In cases of sepsis and an excessive inflammatory response, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has the potential to provide immunomodulation by removing cytokines and inflammatory mediators. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Oxiris filter, which has endotoxin and cytokine adsorption properties, in the pediatric population and compare it with conventional filters. METHOD: This retrospective study examined 42 pediatric intensive care patients diagnosed with sepsis or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The patients received CRRT with either Oxiris filters (n = 21) or conventional filters (n = 21). The study compared hemodynamic and laboratory parameters, as well as mortality. RESULTS: The two groups had similar baseline characteristics and disease severity scores (PRISM III, PELOD II, and OFI). Overall mortality rates were comparable between the Oxiris and conventional filter groups (52.4% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.757), whereas 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the Oxiris group (28.6% vs. 61.9%; p = 0.030). Within 24 h, both filters showed comparable improvements in VIS, heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate, bicarbonate, and albumin levels (all p > 0.05); no significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin levels. Subgroup analysis revealed a more pronounced VIS reduction (p = 0.013), less adequate acidosis correction (p = 0.022), and higher PELOD-II scores (p = 0.026) among non-survivors. Thrombocytopenia was the most common complication, with no difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In critically ill pediatric patients, Oxiris and conventional filters produced comparable short-term hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory effects during CRRT. While overall mortality did not differ between the groups, 28-day mortality was lower in the Oxiris cohort. Further multicenter, prospective research is warranted to confirm these findings and to identify specific pediatric subgroups that may benefit from Oxiris therapy."
41262842,Rapid Clinical Recovery in Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome With Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): A Case Report.,2025,"Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rare but life-threatening condition, with an estimated incidence of 1-3 cases per 100,000 population annually and reported mortality rates exceeding 30% and reaching up to 44% in some series. It is characterized by rapid systemic deterioration due to toxin-producing Streptococcus pyogenes. Prompt recognition and escalation of therapy, including the use of adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), are critical to improving outcomes. We report the case of a previously healthy 37-year-old man who presented with high-grade fever, hypotension, and a widespread erythematous rash. Initial antibiotic therapy targeting skin and soft tissue infection yielded a limited response. Culture from an ulcerated lesion confirmed beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care support, the patient continued to deteriorate. A diagnosis of STSS was made, and IVIG was administered with rapid clinical improvement. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, multidisciplinary management, and the potential role of IVIG in severe STSS."
41262247,"Roles of cytokine storm in sepsis progression: biomarkers, and emerging therapeutic strategies.",2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome marked by uncontrolled systemic inflammation, cytokine storm, and organ dysfunction. Central to its pathogenesis is innate immune hyperactivation, which triggers excessive cytokine release and inflammatory cell death, ultimately driving multiorgan failure. Despite advancements in intensive care, immune dysregulation remains a major therapeutic hurdle. Moreover, recent discoveries of emerging biomarkers, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), monocyte distribution width (MDW), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and RDW-to-albumin ratio (RAR), highlight their potential diagnostic and prognostic value. This review systematically summarizes the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, emphasizing the roles of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we outline current and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting both immune overactivation and late-stage immunosuppression, including cytokine antagonists, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and nanomedicine-based approaches, providing a comprehensive framework to guide precision immunotherapy in sepsis management."
41262245,AIMing for survival: The impact of the free and total AIM concentration in septic patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, remains a major cause of mortality worldwide. Identifying reliable biomarkers for prognosis and treatment is urgently needed. This study investigates the role of the Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophages (AIM), also known as CD5L, as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in sepsis. METHODS: We measured free and total AIM concentrations in 90 septic patients enrolled in SepsisDataNet.NRW cohort (German Clinical Trial Registry No. DRKS00018871; http://www.sepsisdatanet.nrw). Blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 8, and AIM levels were quantified using ELISA. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression were performed to assess the association between AIM levels and 30-day survival. Western blot analysis was performed to detect AIM in human serum IgM and in the IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG preparation Pentaglobin((R)). RESULTS: High total AIM concentrations (>85 ng/ml) were significantly associated with improved 30-day survival on day 1 (HR: 3.131, 95% CI: 1.629-6.019, p = 0.009), 4 (HR: 2.525, 95% CI: 1.198-5.322, p = 0.0042), and day 8 (HR: 2.317, 95% CI: 0.8565-6.266, p = 0.0457). Free AIM showed a significant association with survival only on day 8 (HR: 2.374, 95% CI: 0.8721-6.461, p = 0.0393). CONCLUSION: Total AIM concentration is a significant predictor of a 30-day survival in sepsis, supporting its potential use as a prognostic biomarker. Our findings also suggest that AIM may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential target for immune-modulating therapies, including IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)."
41262084,Torsion in a Pregnant Noncommunicating Uterine Horn - Journey from Misdiagnosis to Laparoscopic Management: A Case Report.,2025,"Pregnancy in a noncommunicating uterine horn (NCUH) is extremely rare and torsion of the pregnant horn is even rarer. Only a few cases have been reported so far. Diagnosis of such extraordinary pathologies can be challenging, and this often leads to misdiagnosis and delay in appropriate treatment. We present the case of a NCUH pregnancy which was initially misdiagnosed on ultrasound and treated with standard miscarriage management regimen. Ongoing symptoms and suspicion of sepsis prompted surgical treatment, and laparoscopy revealed a torted NCUH pregnancy, completely distinct from the unicornuate uterus. The rarity in our case was not only conception in a noncommunicating horn but also the complete torsion of the gravid horn and ipsilateral adnexa. This shows the complexities of dealing with rare uterine abnormalities and highlights the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion and consideration of atypical presentations of an anomalous uterus, especially if medical treatment fails."
41261431,Inhalable targeted CD8 + T cell nanoparticles loaded ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 alleviate acute lung injury.,2025,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common clinical complication of sepsis and ferroptosis plays an important role in ALI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CD8 antibodies modified PD-1 engineered CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTL) membrane loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)/ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) (CD8@PD-1-CTL-M@PLGA/Fer-1) on acute lung injury (ALI). High expression PD-1 CD8 + T (CTL) was established and the membrane (PD-1-CTL-M) was extracted, CD8 monoclonal antibody modified PD-1-CTL-M was used to enhance the targeting capability of PLGA/Fer-1 nanoparticles to target CD8 + T (CTL). ALI model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with mice and CD8 + T (CTL). The results showed that CD8@PD-1-CTL-M significantly enhanced the protective effects of PLGA/Fer-1 on ALI and targetability of PLGA/Fer-1 nanoparticles on CD8 + T (CTL). The mechanism was related to CD8@PD-1-CTL-M@PLGA/Fer-1 targeting regulation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signal pathway in CD8 + T (CTL). This study provided a new treatment method for ALI."
41260995,Piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefoxitin as perioperative prophylaxis for pancreatoduodenectomy: real world evidence from the EPIC Cosmos database.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam was recently demonstrated to reduce the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) and pancreatic fistula following open pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) compared with cefoxitin. Larger scale, real-world data to confirm effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam are lacking. METHODS: Patients undergoing open PD between 2016 and 2024 were identified in the EPIC Cosmos database. Exposure included perioperative administration of piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefoxitin as antimicrobial prophylaxis. Outcomes included development of SSI, pancreatic fistula, sepsis, multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, and mortality (all 30-day outcomes). RESULTS: Among 4039 patients who underwent open PD, 2496 (61.8 %) received perioperative cefoxitin, while 1543 (38.2 %) received piperacillin-tazobactam. Over time, piperacillin-tazobactam replaced cefoxitin as the predominant antimicrobial prophylaxis (p-trend <0.001). Patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam had a higher Charlson comorbidity index, more frequently had a history of diabetes, smoking and more frequently had preoperative biliary stent placed compared with individuals who received cefoxitin (all p < 0.05). Patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam had a lower incidence of any SSI, superficial SSI, deep incisional/organ space SSI, pancreatic fistula and sepsis compared with cefoxitin (all p < 0.05). No difference was observed in 30-day MDR infections or mortality (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of prophylactic piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with better perioperative outcomes compared with cefoxitin among patients undergoing open PD."
41260501,Serum AGP-1-Le(x) Glycoforms Report on Survivorship of Patients with Septic Shock Upon Admission to Intensive Care Unit.,2026,"Septic shock, the excessive immune response to pathogen infection, accounts globally for  approximately 20% of all deaths. Current methods to establish disease severity are unacceptably slow, unspecific, and insensitive, hindering timely and effective treatment. Aiming to establish easy-to-measure glyco-signatures that may identify the most critically unwell patients, we applied comparative glycomics and glycoproteomics to sera longitudinally collected from septic shock survivors (n = 29) and nonsurvivors (n = 8). Glycomics of all 134 serum samples (sampled daily until recovery/death) revealed significant N-glycome dynamics across both patient groups. Unsupervised clustering of the serum N-glycome measured upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission (day 1) indicated survivorship-specific glyco-signatures. We therefore employed machine learning to train a random forest model using the serum N-glycome data. The model accurately classified survivorship outcomes of 35 of 37 patients (accuracy 94.6%) and correctly predicted 29 of 29 survivors (specificity 100%) and six of eight nonsurvivors (sensitivity 75%). Interrogation of the serum N-glycome data revealed that Lewis x (Le(x))-type N-glycans are elevated in nonsurvivors relative to survivors at ICU admission, a finding recapitulated by glycoproteomics. Among the 58 other Le(x)-containing serum glycoproteins that were strongly associated with acute phase response and stress pathways, alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP-1) was identified as a principal carrier of Le(x) glycoepitopes with a potential to stratify septic shock survivors from nonsurvivors (AUC 0.90). This study lays a foundation for risk stratification of septic shock patients by uncovering easy-to-assay AGP-1-Le(x) glycoforms that identify individuals experiencing poor survival outcomes already upon ICU admission, with the potential to translate to early individualized clinical care at the bedside."
41260431,Lipocalin 2 deficiency attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through glycolysis impairment and MGST1-mediated mitochondrial ROS reduction.,2025,"Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a multifunctional innate immune protein, plays a critical role in many biological processes, especially in mediating inflammation. However, its role in the activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome remains elusive. In this study, we generated whole-body Lcn2-knockout mice and demonstrated that Lcn2 deficiency reduced the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 in murine models of sepsis, gouty arthritis and colitis. Using Lcn2-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we showed that Lcn2 deficiency mostly inhibited the inflammatory response by modifying transcriptional priming and posttranslational activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. At the transcriptional level, Lcn2-deficient BMDMs exhibited reduced priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome, as provided by decreased activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB), alongside diminished transcription of NLRP3 and IL-1beta. At the posttranslational level, Lcn2 deficiency attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by reducing glycolytic activity and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mt-ROS) production. Furthermore, upregulation of microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1) in Lcn2-deficient BMDMs mitigated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by suppressing mt-ROS accumulation. Collectively, these findings uncover Lcn2 as an important mediator of inflammatory responses and it could be a prospective target for treating NLRP3-associated inflammatory disorders."
41260155,Virulome and genome-wide association study of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from bloodstream infections versus colonization isolates.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause severe nosocomial infections. The knowledge of virulence profiles of VREfm for the development of invasive infections is still limited. The aim of this study was to analyse gene profiles and genetic variants of VREfm and their association with the development of VREfm bloodstream infections (VRE-BSI). METHODS: One-hundred twenty randomly selected VRE-BSI isolates from a state-wide surveillance study in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia were included in the analysis and matched with one-hundred twenty VREfm colonization (VRE-COL) isolates from a tertiary hospital in North Rhine-Westphalia. All isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysed for the presence or absence of known or putative virulence genes of E. faecium. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was conducted to identify potential associations of genes and genetic variants with the development of VRE-BSI. RESULTS: The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (ST) ST80 and ST117 were the most prevalent STs among VRE-BSI and VRE-COL isolates (ST80: 133 [55 %]; ST117: 98 [41 %]). ST80 was significantly more prevalent in VRE-BSI isolates compared to VRE-COL isolates (75 [63 %] vs. 58 [48 %], p = 0.027). Only fms21 (pilA), a gene of pili gene cluster 1 (PCG-1), coding for a cell-wall-anchored protein involved in adhesive processes, was significantly more prevalent in the VRE-BSI group. GWAS identified no associations of genes or variants with VRE-BSI. CONCLUSION: Using comparative genomics and GWAS, we could not identify a distinct virulence profile for the development of VRE-BSI."
41259840,The diagnostic and prognostic value of circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio in Urosepsis: A prospective study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Urosepsis is a severe complication of urinary tract infections with high morbidity and mortality. Reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical value of the circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio (miR-Ratio) in the early diagnosis and 28-day prognostic prediction of urosepsis. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling patients with urosepsis (n = 62), complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI, n = 124), and healthy controls (n = 60) between January 2023 and December 2024. Serum samples were collected prior to treatment. Exosomes were isolated, and the expression levels of miR-21-5p and miR-181b-5p were quantified to calculate the miR-Ratio. Associations with inflammatory markers, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, acute kidney injury (AKI), and 28-day mortality were assessed using correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The miR-Ratio was significantly elevated in urosepsis compared with controls (P < 0.001) and positively correlated with SOFA score, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and 28-day mortality. ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 for diagnosing urosepsis, with 94.4 % sensitivity and 89.5 % specificity. Multivariate analysis identified the miR-Ratio as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (HR = 3.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio may serve as a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of urosepsis, improving risk stratification and supporting precision clinical management."
41259428,Infection of endothelial cells by Streptococcus agalactiae reveals potential role of PI-2b pilus on endothelial barrier dysfunction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae is responsible for sepsis and meningitis, and the major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, how S. agalactiae disrupts endothelial barriers is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Analyse the influence of endothelial cell (HUVECs) growth under static and shear stress conditions during infection with S. agalactiae, and the role of pilus PI-2b during endothelial barrier disruption and increased endothelial permeability. METHODS: HUVECs under static and shear conditions were infected by S. agalactiae (GBS90356 and GBS90356Deltapilus2b) strains in the presence and absence of fibrinogen. VE-cadherin was evaluated by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR assays, and the endothelial permeability by transwell assay. FINDS: Shear stress induced the alignment of HUVECs and increased the adherence of S. agalactiae strains (GBS90356 and GBS90356Deltapilus2b), mainly in the presence of fibrinogen, in addition to greater peripheral localisation of VE-cadherin. Rupture points and damage to endothelial integrity was visualised after infection with the GBS90356WT strain, mainly in the presence of fibrinogen. RT-PCR analyses identified increase in VE-cadherin expression in HUVECs under shear stress and a decrease in VE-cadherin after infection, with increased levels of endothelial permeability. MAIN CONCLUSION: Data demonstrate for the first time the dysfunction of the adhesive barrier induced by the S. agalactiae ST-17 strain, mainly in HUVECs under shear stress, where PI-2b expression was essential to optimise the damage to endothelial integrity."
41259376,Dissecting the role of NETosis-related biomarkers in Sepsis: An integrated multi-dataset analysis for diagnostic and prognostic applications.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality and economic burdens. The study analyzed non-redundant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to elucidate neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation's role in sepsis pathogenesis using high-throughput microarray and bioinformatics. Our comprehensive analysis meticulously identified a total of 629 DEGs, encompassing 348 upregulated and 281 downregulated genes. Through further scrutiny, we discovered 37 NETosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs) that showcased distinct expression patterns. Enrichment analysis vividly revealed the significant involvement of these NRDEGs in pathways related to NET formation, phagocytosis, and lymphocyte migration, thereby highlighting the crucial role of neutrophils in the immune response during sepsis. Additionally, CIBERSORT algorithm analysis indicated substantial differences in the abundance of 17 immune cell types between the sepsis and control groups, further reinforcing the altered immune landscape in sepsis patients. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed from the NRDEGs identified nine core genes, suggesting their potential central position in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that ITGAM, CXCR2, and FCGR3B exhibited extremely high accuracy in distinguishing sepsis from controls (with an area under the curve greater than 0.9). These remarkable findings strongly underscore the potential of these genes as biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets in sepsis, emphasizing the urgent need for further validation in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and refine treatment strategies. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis, paving the way for improved clinical interventions."
41259305,Early enteral nutrition and mortality in mechanically ventilated septic patients receiving vasopressors: A retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The role of early enteral nutrition (EEN) in septic shock remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between EEN and clinical outcomes in septic patients requiring vasopressor therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the MIMIC-IV database and included adult septic patients receiving vasopressors and mechanical ventilation at ICU admission. EEN was defined as enteral nutrition initiated within 48 hours. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for baseline confounders. Vasopressor dose was stratified based on the maximum norepinephrine-equivalent dose in the first 48 hours: low (<0.1 micrograms/kg/min), medium (0.1-0.5), and high (>0.5). Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations. RESULTS: A total of 4,673 patients were included, of whom 997 (21.3%) received EEN. Before weighting, EEN was associated with higher 28-day mortality (21.9% vs. 15.3%). After IPTW adjustment, early feeding remained significantly associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 2.27). In stratified analyses, EEN was associated with increased mortality in the medium-dose (odds ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 2.19, p < 0.001) and high-dose groups (1.90; 1.21 to 2.98, p < 0.001), but not in the low-dose group(1.92, 1.12 to 3.27, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill septic patients receiving vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, EEN was associated with increased 28-day mortality, particularly among those receiving medium- or high-dose vasopressor therapy."
41258927,Construction of a Minimal Sensor Array Using Fingerprint Protein Corona on Nanostars for Detecting Protein Isoforms and Disease States.,2026,"Signature-based protein detection coupled with machine learning algorithms has revolutionized traditional sensing methods, providing rapid, inexpensive, and selectivity-driven detection without the use of specialized equipment. This strategy leverages selective interactions with a sensor array to create a global signature pattern using machine learning. The reference pattern provides an effective tool to stratify the analytes, identify blinded unknowns, and predict altered signatures of the analyte that could be missed by the common specificity-based sensors. Protein corona adsorbed on a nanoparticle surface presents fingerprint signatures of the bound proteins, which can potentially be harnessed to profile protein biomarkers. Herein, we demonstrate that gold nanostars (AuNS) generate a fingerprint protein corona that dictates the modulation of the AuNS surface plasmons upon etching. The resultant spectrometric signatures are utilized in discriminating between diverse proteins, including isoforms, at significantly low concentrations and with a wide dynamic range. The approach effectively discerns the protein corona signatures of healthy controls from two preclinical disease models of autoimmune dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and Salmonella Typhimurium infection-induced sepsis, demonstrating its clinical diagnostic potential. Notably, the ability of AuNS to offer binding recognition and signal transduction on a single platform introduces a robust material for signature-based detections, simplifying the sensor fabrication and offering a great opportunity for the identification of diverse targets."
41258783,Dithioether Inhibitors of Bacterial RNA Polymerase-Sigma Factor Interactions Exhibit In Vivo Efficacy against MRSA.,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a critical and escalating global health threat, necessitating the development of novel antibacterial agents. Herein, we describe a new series of dithioether-based bacterial transcription inhibitors that target RNA polymerase (RNAP) and its transcription initiation factor sigma. These compounds, designed through rational modification of established scaffolds, demonstrate potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.5 mug/mL. Mechanistic studies reveal that these inhibitors bind to the clamp-helix region of the RNAP beta' subunit, thereby disrupting sigma factor binding and effectively inhibiting bacterial transcription. Pharmacokinetic profiling indicates preferential accumulation in the bloodstream, which correlates with significant therapeutic efficacy in a murine sepsis model. Collectively, these findings establish dithioether scaffolds as a promising platform for the development of new antibacterial agents to address the urgent need for effective therapies against resistant bacterial infections."
41258369,Association between in vitro fertilization and severe neonatal morbidity.,2026,"PURPOSE: To determine whether an association exists between in vitro fertilization (IVF) and severe neonatal morbidity. Secondary objectives were to assess 1) the association between donor oocytes and severe neonatal morbidity, 2) whether respiratory-related versus non-respiratory severe neonatal morbidity differs by IVF status, and 3) antenatal steroid administration rates between cohorts. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of live singleton deliveries between 01/2019-12/2023 within an academic health system. The primary outcome was severe neonatal morbidity, a composite measure adapted from the Neonatal Adverse Outcome Indicator (NAOI), incorporating selected diagnoses (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis) and procedures (e.g., mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion) that represent life-threatening neonatal complications. The secondary outcome was the need for antepartum steroid administration. Mixed effects multivariable logistic regression modeled the association between IVF and severe neonatal morbidity, adjusting for covariates. Odds ratios (ORs), and their associated 95% confidence interval (CIs) were computed; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among 46,761 pregnancies delivered at > 32 weeks gestation, 2,327 conceived via IVF. Severe neonatal morbidity occurred in 10.5% (n = 245) in the IVF group, compared to 6.9% (n = 3,079) in the non-IVF group (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.48-1.95; aOR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.23-1.66). CONCLUSION: IVF-conceived infants are more likely to experience severe neonatal morbidity. Future studies should investigate mechanisms underlying these associations to guide counseling and optimize care."
41258221,"Rational design of thrombin-derived VFR12 analogs with enhanced antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anti-inflammatory properties.",2025,"The worsening crisis of antibiotic resistance demands innovative therapies to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens. In this study, we report the rational design and optimization of VFR12 (VFRLKKWIQKVI), a thrombin C-terminus-derived 12-mer peptide, via systematic amino acid substitutions and stereochemical modifications. A series of 12-mer analogs were synthesized and assessed for antimicrobial activity, cell selectivity, biofilm disruption, and immunomodulatory effects. Six lead candidates (VFR12-a7, VFR12-a8, VFR12-a7(L), VFR12-a8(L), VFR12-a7(L)-d, VFR12-a8(L)-d) demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with minimal hemolytic activity. Notably, D-amino acid variants VFR12-a7(L)-d and VFR12-a8(L)-d showed significantly improved therapeutic indices, complete resistance to proteolysis, and enhanced serum stability compared to their L-isomers. These peptides effectively inhibited biofilm formation and disrupted preformed biofilms while maintaining excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, Anti-inflammatory assessment revealed significant suppression of LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and nitric oxide, along with strong endotoxin neutralization. Among the analogs, VFR12-a8(L)-d emerged as the most promising candidate, combining potent antimicrobial activity with excellent safety and multifaceted therapeutic properties. These findings provide a valuable framework for the development of next-generation host defense peptides with integrated antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anti-inflammatory properties, offering a multifaceted approach to tackling antibiotic resistance and sepsis."
41258046,Reduced plasma levels of Copine 5 correlate with sepsis-induced vascular leakage and mortality in human patients and a murine sepsis model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vascular leakage is a major cause of multiple organ failure and mortality in sepsis, and factors that regulate endothelial integrity could serve as promising biomarkers of septic shock development. Copine family members (CPNEs) are well-characterized as soluble membrane-binding proteins, whether CPNEs play a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity during sepsis, however, remains unclear. METHODS: Human aorta single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data were analyzed for the expression profile of all Copine family members (CPNE1-9). Plasma levels of CPNE5, Ang-II, sICAM-1, and SDC-1 were measured in human sepsis patients at admission and healthy donors as well as in septic mice induced by injection i.p. with cecal slurry. The correlation of CPNE5 levels to other three factors (Ang-II, sICAM-1, SDC-1) were analyzed. CPNE5-knockdown endothelial cells (ECs) and global CPNE5-knockout (KO) mice were utilized to determine the critical role of CPNE5 in sepsis-triggered vascular leakage, organ damage and mortality. RESULTS: Among nine CPNEs, only CPNE5 is predominantly expressed in human aorta endothelial cells. In sepsis patients (n = 77), plasma levels of CPNE5 were significantly reduced, whereas plasma levels of Ang-II, sICAM-1, and SDC-1 were markedly elevated, compared to healthy donors (n = 44; p < 0.01). Similar findings were also observed in a murine sepsis model induced by cecal slurry (CS)-injection intraperitoneally. Furthermore, in the supernatants of cultured ECs treated with LPS or pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture (Cytomix: TNFalpha/IL-1beta/IFNgamma, each 10 ng/mL), the concentrations of CPNE5 were significantly lower, which was negatively correlated with the higher EC permeability, compared to the control group. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CPNE5 in ECs caused hyperpermeability upon stimulation with LPS or Cytomix. In vivo, we observed that loss of CPNE5 increased vascular leakage, leading to severe organ injury and higher mortality, compared to WT mice upon septic conditions. The initial mechanistic analysis showed that the reduction of CPNE5 in cardiac and pulmonary ECs was linked to the increased cleavage of membrane tight junctions and adherens junctions. CONCLUSIONS: These observations from human sepsis patients and a murine sepsis model suggest that reduced plasma levels of CPNE5 may contribute to sepsis-induced vascular leakage and mortality."
41257935,The association between blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio and 28-day ICU mortality in sepsis patients: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, with mortality rates up to 30%. While the Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) to Albumin ratio has been associated with outcomes in various conditions, the dose-response relationship between this ratio and mortality in sepsis patients remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 9,783 sepsis patients from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The relationship between BUN/Albumin ratio and 28-day ICU mortality was examined using multivariate logistic regression and threshold effect analysis. Models were adjusted for demographics, clinical parameters, comorbidities, and laboratory values. Threshold effect analysis was performed using two-piecewise linear regression. RESULTS: A non-linear relationship was identified between the BUN/Albumin ratio and 28-day ICU mortality, with a threshold at 20.91 mg/g (95% CI 17.19-26.90). Below this threshold, each unit difference in the ratio was associated with higher mortality odds (OR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.08, P < 0.0001). Above the threshold, the association persisted but is markedly attenuated (OR: 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02). This relationship remained robust after adjusting for potential confounders and in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear association was observed between the BUN/Albumin ratio and 28-day ICU mortality among patients with sepsis, with an inflection point established at 20.91 mg/g. This readily accessible parameter has the potential to aid in early risk stratification within the ICU setting. Additional research is warranted to validate these findings."
41257830,Efficacy and safety of super-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy using a combination of suction sheath and pneumatic lithotripsy: the Dhangadhi experience.,2025,"PURPOSE: Super-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (SMP) is a promising minimally invasive approach for upper tract stone management. However, evidence on its performance using suction sheath and pneumatic lithotripsy in resource-limited setting remains scarce. The main objective of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of SMP done exclusively with this combination. METHODS: Prospectively collected data of all eligible SMP cases done in two centers between March 2021 and February 2025 were retrospectively processed. After de-identification of the final data, descriptive and analytical statistics were used as appropriate. Regression models were then constructed to identify risk factors for complications. RESULTS: Total of 324 prone SMP procedures were performed on 319 patients. The mean stone volume, operating time and fluoroscopy beam-on time were 1473 mm(3), 38 min, and 145 s respectively. The mean hemoglobin drop was 1.2 +/- 0.9 gm% with 2.1% of patients requiring blood transfusion. Overall, stone-free rate was 96.9% at 1-month follow-up, minor complications (Clavien-Dindo </= II) being 13.4%, and major complications (Clavien-Dindo > II) being 2.2%. Multinomial regression analysis revealed operating time > 40 min, positive urine culture, and access through 10th intercostal space as significant predictors of complications. Limitation includes retrospective design, lack of computerized tomography for confirming stone-free status, and lack of intra-renal pressure monitoring. CONCLUSION: SMP using a combination of suction sheath and pneumatic lithotripsy is a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases with upper tract lithiasis in resource-limited settings, with high stone clearance and acceptable complication rates."
41257780,Comparative analysis of outcomes of one stage versus staged surgical repair in esophageal atresia: an audit from a tertiary pediatric center in low resources country.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal atresia (EA) is a life-threatening congenital anomaly requiring surgical repair. The choice between primary (one-stage) and staged repair remains debated, particularly in neonates with long-gap EA or comorbidities. Evidence from resource-limited settings is scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 115 neonates with EA who underwent surgical repair at Motahari Pediatric Hospital, Iran (2017-2024). Patients were classified into one-stage or staged repair groups. Demographics, associated anomalies, complications, operative time, hospital stay, and survival were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: Of 115 patients, 68 underwent one-stage repair and 47 staged repair. Baseline characteristics were comparable, though Type A EA was more frequent in staged cases. Postoperative complication rates, including anastomotic stricture, leak, pneumonia, and sepsis, were similar between groups. Failed gastrostomy was significantly higher in staged repair (p = 0.01). Survival rates were comparable (79.4% vs. 78.7%). Mean operative time and hospital stay were longer in the staged group but not statistically significant. Gestational age showed a significant inverse correlation with operative duration (rho = - 0.225, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: One-stage and staged repairs demonstrated comparable short-term outcomes in EA. Individualized surgical planning, considering gestational age, gap length, and comorbidities, is essential. These findings highlight that acceptable outcomes can be achieved even in resource-limited settings, supporting tailored decision-making rather than universal preference for either technique."
41257632,Do we need to reconsider our antibiotic regimen for preterm premature rupture of membranes? Pathogens and perinatal outcome in PPROM.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The antibiotic regimen currently recommended in most guidelines in case of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) with an aminopenicillin and a macrolide is mainly based on studies performed more than 25 years ago. In view of the changing pathogens in neonatal and perinatal infectious morbidity and their increasing aminopenicillin-resistance in recent decades, the question arises as to whether these data are still applicable to our current situation and whether an adjustment of our antibiotic standard regimen with amoxicillin and azithromycin is necessary. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the pathogens and the perinatal outcome, particularly the perinatal and neonatal infectious morbidity, in 293 pregnancies with PPROM < 37 + 0 weeks and delivery in our department from 01/2020 to 12/2023. RESULTS: In PPROM < 34+0 weeks, we found neonatal infection (defined by clinical infection criteria) in 14.5%, neonatal early-onset sepsis (defined by clinical infection criteria plus invasive pathogen detection) in 3.6% and one case of maternal sepsis. The causative pathogens of the 6 neonatal early-onset sepsis cases were in 3 cases (50%) E.coli (2/3 amoxicillin-resistant) and in one case each Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mitis and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the vaginal swabs were Ureaplasma species (25%). The most common pathogens in the placental swabs were, in general, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (21.2%), followed by E.coli (10.2%) and Ureaplasma species (8.8%) and, in case of histological confirmed chorioamnionitis, Ureaplasma species (21.4%), followed by E. coli (17.9%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (14.3%). In PPROM >/= 34+0 weeks, we found neonatal infection in 2.6% and there was no case of neonatal or maternal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: E.coli and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, both predominantly resistant to aminopenicillins, as well as Ureaplasma species seem to be the currently most relevant pathogens in PPROM. Therefore, azithromycin should be administered, but amoxicillin no longer appears to be the optimal regimen. Further research comparing different antibiotic regimens with better coverage of the currently relevant pathogens such as co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) or cephalosporins is needed."
41257595,"Molecular epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecium bloodstream isolates: a 7-year study in Shandong, China.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecium is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, particularly bloodstream infections, which are associated with high mortality rates. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and virulence determinants of E. faecium isolates from bloodstream infections in a tertiary hospital in Shandong, China, over a seven-year period (2017-2023). RESULTS: Among 91 E. faecium isolates, 4 were vancomycin-resistant (VREfm), and 87 were vancomycin-susceptible (VSEfm). High resistance rates (> 87.9%) were observed for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified 16 sequence types (STs), dominated by ST78 (41.8%) and ST555 (22.0%), with a novel ST designated ST2760. Notably, the prevalence of ST555 increased significantly from 18.2% in 2021 to 43.8% in 2023. Thirteen of the 16 STs (95.6% of isolates) were assigned to Clonal Complex 17 (CC17), while ST775, ST922, and the novel ST2760 were phylogenetically distinct from this predominant lineage. Virulence gene analysis revealed high detection rates (> 73%) of adhesion-associated genes (pilA, pilB, acm, sgrA, scm, esp, and ecbA). The pilA gene was significantly more prevalent in ST78 (92.1%) than in ST555 (40.0%), conferring higher biofilm-forming capacity. The absence of pilA in ST555 strains prior to 2021 correlated with lower detection rates, while its emergence post-2021 coincided with enhanced environmental fitness and increased clinical prevalence. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the predominance of ST78 and ST555 in E. faecium bloodstream infections, with their increasing prevalence linked to acquisition of the pilA gene and enhanced environmental survival through biofilm formation. The identification of a novel ST2760 underscores the ongoing genetic diversity of E. faecium. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing infection control strategies and guiding empirical therapy for E. faecium bloodstream infections."
41257583,"The predictive performance of NEWS, MEWS, SOFA and SAPS II in outcomes of bacteremic and non-bacteremic sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the prognostic accuracy of sepsis scores and inflammatory biomarkers in predicting mortality, bacteremia, and septic shock among sepsis patients, with comparisons across bacteremic and non-bacteremic groups. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center in western India. A total of 196 sepsis patients were enrolled and categorized into bacteremic (n = 95) and non-bacteremic (n = 101) groups. Key sepsis scores analyzed included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II). Outcomes measured included 30-day mortality, bacteraemia prediction, and septic shock. Diagnostic performance was assessed using area under curve (AUCs), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (OR) analysis. RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate was 27.0%. Among all patients, NEWS (AUC: 0.861, 95% CI: 0.81-0.92, p < 0.001) and SOFA (AUC: 0.738, 95% CI:0.65-0.82, p < 0.001) demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for 30 days mortality. Subgroup analysis revealed that, in bacteremic sepsis, NEWS (AUC: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-0.99, p < 0.001) and ferritin (AUC: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.71-0.90, p < 0.001) showed the highest predictive values, while SOFA (AUC: 0.852, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94, p < 0.001) and HsCRP (AUC: 0.623, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74, p = 0.033) were most predictive for mortality in non-bacteremic sepsis. MEWS (>/= 7) demonstrated the strongest association with bacteremia (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.4-11, p < 0.001, adjusted for age, and comorbidities), followed by SOFA (>/= 6), (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.2, p = 0.005). For septic shock prediction, SOFA (>/= 6) (OR: 5.7) and procalcitonin (>/= 2.5 ng/mL) (OR: 4.9) were the strongest predictors. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS and SOFA demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, with ferritin providing additional value in bacteremic patients. For bacteremia prediction, MEWS (>/= 7) showed the highest association. These tools can provide critical support for clinicians in risk stratification and early intervention in severe sepsis. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: not applicable."
41257475,"Clinical Characteristics, Microbiological Profile, and Mortality Predictors in Pediatric Community-Acquired Sepsis: A Single-Center Study.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Community-acquired sepsis presents distinct challenges in children due to immature immunity, variable clinical features, and emerging antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, microbiological profile, treatment, and mortalityrelated possible risk factors for mortality in pediatric community-acquired sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 107 previously healthy children diagnosed with community-acquired sepsis and admitted to the PICU between February 2020 and June 2023. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Patients were analyzed based on culture positivity and survival status. RESULTS: Among 1853 PICU admissions, 107 met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 2.5 years, and the overall mortality rate was 6.5%. Blood culture positivity was 14%, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen (46.7%), followed by Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species (13.3% each). Pulmonary involvement was the most common infection site (28%). Mortality was significantly associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), invasive mechanical ventilation, and longer ventilation duration. Culture positivity correlated with longer hospital and noninvasive ventilation duration. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus was the leading cause of pediatric community-acquired sepsis. Critical complications such as AKI, mechanical ventilation, and a higher number of red blood cell transfusions were linked to mortality. All children with proven gram-negative sepsis were under 1.5 years, and 2 were later diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency, suggesting that early gram-negative infections in infants may reflect an underlying immune defect, as immunodeficiencies predispose to sepsis caused by unusual or atypical pathogens. Timely diagnosis and careful management are vital for better outcomes in vulnerable patients."
41257129,Fulminant Tuberculous Pericarditis Presenting as Cardiac Tamponade in an Infliximab-Treated Patient.,2025,"Tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), representing a clinically important subset of pericarditis cases. Diagnostic uncertainty arises from variable symptoms and the low sensitivity of available tests. Although culture is the gold standard, it is reliable but too slow to enable a timely diagnosis. Acute and fulminant presentations have been reported in immunosuppressed patients. A 61-year-old woman, recently receiving infliximab and corticosteroids for Crohn's disease, presented to the emergency department with signs of sepsis and obstructive shock. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion, prompting urgent pericardiocentesis. Analysis of pericardial fluid was negative for acid-fast bacilli. She remained unwell, with persistently elevated inflammatory markers, bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, intra- and extra-thoracic lymphadenopathy, and subsequently developed heart failure. After nearly two weeks, endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration with Cepheid GeneXpert TB PCR confirmed rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This case is unusual because it combines three rare features: fulminant TBP presenting as acute tamponade, reactivation of TB in the setting of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, and transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction following pericardial drainage. It highlights the importance of considering TB pericarditis in immunosuppressed patients, recognizing the limitations of conventional fluid-based diagnostics, and pursuing timely tissue sampling to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy."
41256863,Lymphocytes and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood and lymphatic fluid of neonates with chylothorax.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal chylothorax is associated with high morbidity and mortality, partly due to increased infection risk from lymphocyte depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia. However, data specific to chylothorax cohorts are limited. This study aimed to investigate lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin levels in neonates with congenital and acquired chylothorax. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 18 neonates with chylothorax admitted to our NICU between January 2023 and January 2025. Inclusion criteria were term or preterm infants with congenital or acquired chylothorax and paired peripheral blood and chyle samples collected within 48 hours of effusion onset. Lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin levels were compared between blood and chyle, and between congenital and acquired chylothorax. RESULTS: Chyle samples showed significantly higher leukocyte, lymphocyte (percentage and absolute), and T-cell counts compared to blood. Conversely, B lymphocyte percentages and Natural killer (NK) cell counts were significantly lower in chyle, as were IgG and IgM levels. Three patients (16.7%) had absolute lymphopenia, particularly within the T-cell and NK-cell subsets, and five (27.8%) had hypogammaglobulinemia. Fifteen infants (83.3%) developed late-onset sepsis, primarily bacterial, with some fungal cases. Absolute T-cell subset numbers in chyle were higher in acquired versus congenital chylothorax, while percentages and immunoglobulin levels were largely similar. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm a specific pattern of immune dysregulation in neonates with chylothorax, with distinct lymphocyte and immunoglobulin profiles in chyle. In particular, the T-cell subsets were enriched in the chyle. A multicenter, prospective randomized trial is warranted to assess the utility of immunoglobulin therapy in infection prevention in this population."
41256846,Combatting sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction: emerging mechanisms and immunomodulatory breakthroughs.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) critically contributes to mortality in systemic inflammatory responses, driven by multifaceted mechanisms including dysregulated inflammation, immunosuppression, oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction. Emerging pathways involve m6A RNA methylation (mediated by methyltransferase METTL3), which coordinates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis through transcriptomic rewiring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve dual roles: propagating injury via microRNA-885-5p/HMBOX1-induced pyroptosis and delivering therapeutic cargo (e.g., microRNA-223) to suppress inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction, marked by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and impaired sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) stability, exacerbates metabolic disorder. Autonomic neuromodulation strategies, such as electroacupuncture and noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation, attenuate cardiac injury by rebalancing neuroimmune interactions. Complement hyperactivation (C5a-C5a receptor axis) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibodies) show preclinical efficacy. However, challenges persist in addressing immune heterogeneity, dynamic biomarker profiling, and optimal therapeutic timing. This review bridges mechanistic discoveries to clinical innovation, proposing a paradigm shift toward precision therapies. Future research must bridge mechanistic insights with clinical innovation. By harmonizing pathophysiological understanding with precision medicine approaches, this synthesis underscores the potential to transform SIMD management from supportive care to targeted functional recovery."
41255669,Determinants of infection for antibiotic initiation at pediatric emergency admission: A prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Due to non-specific and overlapping features, particularly in infants, and a lack of awareness of important signs and symptoms, early diagnosis of sepsis is difficult. AIM: To identify the determinants for bacterial infection based on clinical evidence and point-of-care (POC) investigations in children at admission to a pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) unit. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a PEM unit of a tertiary care hospital in Central India. A scoring system based on these determinants for initiation of antibiotics in the golden hour (i.e. the first 60 minutes) was developed, termed as the Children's Antibiotic Requirement Evaluation Score (CARES) Index. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1419 children presenting to the PEM, 802 children were enrolled. The best predictors of infection were found to be abnormal color, fever, features of fluid overload, altered sensorium, cellulitis, use of antibiotics, and C-reactive protein. These parameters were amalgamated to form the CARES Index, which showed moderate accuracy for determinants of infection for initiation of antibiotics in a pediatric emergency. Among the POC investigations, the sensitivity of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80.00%) was maximum, while specificity was highest for procalcitonin (75.31%). CONCLUSION: We highlighted the association of clinical parameters, symptoms, and POC investigations in pediatric bacterial infections. Some parameters emerged as strong predictors of sepsis, and no single factor was sufficient for a definitive diagnosis."
41255668,Diagnostic and prognostic utility of D-dimer and heparin-binding protein in neonatal sepsis: A prospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a serious health problem, with high morbidity and mortality during the first 28 days of life. Clinical diagnosis at presentation is challenging due to the nonspecific signs and symptoms. Although blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, it is not always positive. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of D-dimer and heparin-binding protein (HBP) in neonatal sepsis. METHODS: This prospective case-control study included 90 neonates in two groups: A sepsis group (n = 45) and a control group (n = 45) without sepsis. Sepsis group was further subdivided based on blood culture results into proven sepsis (n = 28 culture-positive sepsis) and suspected sepsis (n = 17 culture-negative sepsis). All neonates underwent complete history taking, thorough clinical examination and investigations [complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), liver and kidney function tests, plasma D-dimer and HBP]. RESULTS: Levels of CRP, D-dimer and HBP were significantly higher in the sepsis group compared to the controls. At a cutoff value above 517.9 ng/mL, D-dimer outperformed CRP and HBP in distinguishing sepsis group from controls with 95.6% sensitivity and 97.8% specificity. D-dimer was also a better prognostic marker than the neonatal sequential organ failure assessment (nSOFA) for predicting mortality, with 100% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity vs 80% sensitivity and 82.5% specificity. There was a significant positive correlation between CRP, D-dimer and HBP. CONCLUSION: D-dimer demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to CRP and HBP in predicting sepsis, and demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy compared to nSOFA in predicting the outcome of neonatal sepsis."
41255658,"Neonatal and pediatric sepsis: Microbiological insights, diagnostic innovations, and antimicrobial challenges.",2025,"Neonatal and pediatric sepsis remains a major global health concern, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. The clinical and microbiological characteristics of sepsis differ markedly in neonates and children, necessitating tailored diagnostic and treatment approaches. This mini-review explores the evolving microbiological landscape, recent advancements in diagnostic methodologies, and challenges posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in managing neonatal and pediatric sepsis. Emerging pathogens, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and fungal organisms, are reshaping the epidemiology of sepsis. Innovations in molecular diagnostics, including polymerase chain reaction-based platforms, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence-integrated tools, are revolutionizing early pathogen detection and resistance profiling. However, implementation gaps persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Therapeutic challenges are compounded by limited pediatric data on newer antimicrobials and rising AMR rates. Infection prevention strategies, especially in intensive care units, are crucial to outbreak containment. An integrated approach combining microbiological surveillance, rapid diagnostics, and antimicrobial stewardship is critical for improving sepsis outcomes. Future research should focus on context-specific implementation of diagnostic tools and optimizing treatment strategies for resource-limited settings."
41255589,The Intestinal Immune Network for IgA Production is Involved in the Development and Progression of Sepsis: A Multi-Omics Study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Intestinal barrier injury plays a significant role in the development and progression of sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: The ""intestinal immune network for IgA production"" pathway (KEGG ID: hsa04672) is closely associated with the intestinal barrier. This study integrated bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data, a clinical trial, an animal study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to elucidate the role of hsa04672 during sepsis. RESULTS: Enrichment analyses confirmed the relationship between hsa04672 and sepsis. Four machine learning algorithms identified HLA-DPA1 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.995), ITGB7 (AUC = 0.967), and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.942) as hsa04672-associated diagnostic biomarkers. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) revealed suppressed activity of hsa04672 in sepsis patients. Two independent methods (GSVA scores and consensus clustering) generated hsa04672-associated sepsis subgroups. Kaplan-Meier analyses subsequently confirmed significant survival differences between these subgroups, indicating a relationship between hsa04672 and sepsis prognosis. Afterwards, univariable Cox, LASSO, and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified ANKRD55, CX3CR1, and GIMAP4 as hsa04672-associated prognostic biomarkers. Based on these prognostic biomarkers, we constructed a nomogram model, whose accuracy and robustness were demonstrated through calibration curves, decision curve analyses, and time-dependent ROC curves. In the animal study, reduced intestinal IgA production was observed in severe sepsis. Single-cell analyses revealed the activities of hsa04672 and the expression patterns of biomarkers within each immune cell type across healthy controls, sepsis survivors, and sepsis nonsurvivors. MR analyses suggested that elevated CXCR4 expression was a risk factor of sepsis (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.58, P = 0.036), and decreased GIMAP4 expression was a risk factor of 28-day death in sepsis (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: The ""intestinal immune network for IgA production"" is deeply involved in the development and progression of sepsis."
41255509,Poking Around: A Comparative Study of Complications in Trans-rectal Versus Trans-perineal Prostate Biopsies.,2025,"Background Trans-rectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) has historically been the commonest method for diagnosing prostate cancer but carries an increased risk of infection related to rectal flora. Trans-perineal prostate biopsy (TPPB), which avoids the rectal mucosa, is proposed to reduce infectious complications. This study compares post-biopsy infection rates and length of hospital stay (LOS) between TRPB and TPPB at Mater Dei Hospital, Malta. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all TRPBs performed in 2022 and all TPPBs performed in 2024 by urologists at Mater Dei Hospital. Outcomes analyzed were prostatitis, sepsis, and LOS. Sepsis was defined using Sepsis-3 criteria. Categorical values were analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and LOS was analyzed using Welch's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA). Results Of 177 TRPB cases, 10 (5.6%) developed prostatitis compared with two of 231 TPPB cases (0.9%). This difference was statistically significant (chi(2)(1)=8.03, p=0.0046; Fisher's p=0.0061). Median LOS for admitted patients was longer after TRPB (six days) than TPPB (five days), but this difference was not statistically significant (Welch t=0.898, p=0.507; Mann-Whitney U=15.5, p=0.415). No TPPB patient developed sepsis. Conclusion TPPB demonstrated significantly fewer infectious complications and eliminated sepsis compared with TRPB. These findings support the trans-perineal route as a safer standard of care."
41254509,Temporal validation of the Ramathibodi Older Sepsis Score (ROSS) for predicting 28-day mortality of older sepsis patients in the emergency department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis in older patients is associated with a high mortality rate, presenting a considerable clinical challenge. Existing mortality prediction scoring systems have demonstrated limited accuracy in this population. The Ramathibodi Older Sepsis Score (ROSS) was developed to address this limitation. However, temporal validation is necessary to assess its efficacy in predicting 28-day mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the Ramathibodi Older Sepsis Score (ROSS) for predicting 28-day mortality in older sepsis patients in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Data for the development cohort were retrospectively collected from August to December 2018, while data for the validation cohort were collected from January to June 2022. Seven prespecified prognostic factors for 28-day mortality were used to develop a predictive a predictive score and assess its performance. RESULTS: A total of 500 older sepsis patients were included in the validation cohort, and 599 patients were included in the development cohort. The predictive ability of the ROSS model in the validation cohort (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve; AuROC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.61-0.77) decreased compared to the development cohort (AuROC: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.92); P < 0.01. This performance was compared with other scoring models: SIRS (AuROC: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.42-0.58; P < 0.01), qSOFA (AuROC: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64-0.77; P = 0.75), NEWS2 (AuROC: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60-0.76; P = 0.81), and REWS (AuROC: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.75; P = 0.51). CONCLUSION: The temporal validation of the ROSS demonstrated moderate performance in predicting 28-day mortality in older sepsis patients, with AuROC values similar to qSOFA and NEWS2. Although ROSS did not outperform existing scores, it offers geriatric-specific insights and highlights the need for further validation."
41254473,Identification of immunometabolism-associated genes and immune infiltration in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy using integrated bioinformatics and machine learning approaches.,2025,"ObjectiveSepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, a life-threatening complication of sepsis, carries a significant mortality risk. Despite its clinical severity, the immunometabolic mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify immunometabolism-associated genes in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and analyze immune infiltration.MethodsWe integrated single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from septic cohorts, using a multistep bioinformatic approach involving machine learning and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify key immunometabolism-associated genes and explore their role in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Key findings were validated using in vitro and in vivo experiments.ResultsWe identified two distinct macrophage subsets (functional and senescent) and prioritized four hub genes, including ABLIM1, BCL9L, SMAD3, and DHRS3, which formed a robust prognostic model (area under the curve = 0.724). In vivo and in vitro validation confirmed significant downregulation of these hub genes in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant increases in monocytes, M0/M1 macrophages, and neutrophils in sepsis, with hub genes showing significant correlations with specific immune cell subsets.ConclusionsThis study identifies ABLIM1, BCL9L, SMAD3, and DHRS3 genes as pivotal biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, linked to immune-metabolic dysregulation and myocardial injury. These findings provide new insights for early diagnosis and precision immunotherapy of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy."
41253992,Ability of the hypotension prediction index to predict hypotension in patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit.,2025,"The hypotension prediction index (HPI) is a machine learning-based model for predicting hypotension. It provides good performance for predicting intraoperative hypotension but has rarely been studied in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This prospective study aimed to determine the ability of HPI to predict hypotension in ICU-admitted patients with septic shock. Hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of < 65 mmHg >/= 1 min. Non-hypotensive events included MAP > 75 and >/= 65 mmHg for the primary and secondary objectives, respectively. Positive events were selected at 5, 10, and 15-min before hypotension. Thirty patients with septic shock (293,315 data points) were included; 645 hypotensive events occurred, with a median of 14.5 [8-31] events/patient and a median time of 3.2 [2.5-4] min. At 5 and 10 min before hypotension, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of HPI was significantly higher than at 15 min (0.953 vs. 0.919, p = 0.002 and 0.934 vs. 0.919, p = 0.01, respectively). HPI at 5, 10, and 15 min before the events showed better performance than other hemodynamic variables. However, after including MAP 65-75 mmHg as a non-hypotensive event, the ability of HPI declined and was similar to that of current MAP for predicting hypotension at all time points (AUC 0.817 vs. 0.786, p = 0.28 for 5 min, 0.787 vs. 0.761, p = 0.4 for 10 min, and 0.753 vs. 0.720, p = 0.31 for 15 min before the event). HPI showed excellent performance in predicting hypotension in septic shock patients in the ICU. However, its ability decreased when MAP 65-75 mmHg was considered non-hypotension. The HPI algorithm requires revisions to improve its predictive ability."
41253896,Machine learning glucose forecasting models for septic patients.,2025,"Sepsis-induced glucose fluctuations present major challenges in critical care, underscoring the importance of accurate glucose monitoring and forecasting to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a suite of forecasting models trained using continuous glucose monitoring data from a diabetic patient with sepsis (19,621 data points). The models include four transformer-based ones (iTransformer, Crossformer, PatchTST, FEDformer), a dynamic linear model (DLinear), and an ensemble zero-shot inference method leveraging ChatGPT-4. Model performance was evaluated for 15-, 30-, and 60-minute prediction horizons with an optimized 30-minute lookback window. PatchTST achieved the lowest mean maximum percentage error (MMPE) for short-term forecasts (3.0% at 15 minutes), while DLinear excelled at longer horizons (7.46% and 14.41% MMPE at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively). The ensemble ChatGPT-4 approach also showed competitive results. Overall, this work offers a toolbox of advanced forecasting models for ICU glucose prediction and management. The comprehensive comparison among the models highlights the promise of machine learning models-particularly DLinear and PatchTST-in supporting glucose monitoring and ultimately digital twin implementations, paving the way toward personalized and adaptive glycemic control in septic patients."
41253419,Utility of a C-Reactive Protein Declination Curve for Detecting Misadventure after Enterocutaneous Fistula Takedown: Opportunity for Early Detection?,2025,"Background: Enterocutaneous (EC) fistulae are a significant complication of abdominal surgery. The surgical takedown of EC fistulae carries a high risk of complications, including sepsis, recurrence, and mortality. Identifying biomarkers to detect complications early may improve outcomes. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation and tissue injury, has shown promise in predicting anastomotic leaks in colorectal surgery. This study evaluates the utility of post-operative CRP declination curves in detecting leaks after EC fistula takedown. Methods: This retrospective case series analyzed adult patients undergoing EC fistula takedown performed by a single surgeon at our institution over the past three years. Inclusion required documented EC fistulae, failure of nonoperative management, and at least three post-operative high-sensitivity CRP measurements. C-reactive protein, white blood cell (WBC), and temperature trends were analyzed alongside secondary outcomes: fistula recurrence, hospital stay, and complications. Results: Seven of 15 eligible cases met the inclusion criteria. C-reactive protein levels peaked immediately post-operatively and on average declined in patients without leaks, stabilizing by the second post-operative week. In patients with leaks, CRP levels deviated from this pattern, remaining elevated until managed. While WBC counts and temperatures showed variable trends, CRP demonstrated more consistent correlations with post-operative recovery and complications. Conclusion: High-sensitivity CRP may serve as a useful adjunct for early detection of post-operative leaks following EC fistula takedown. Preliminary findings support further prospective studies to validate CRP declination curves as a diagnostic tool, potentially improving monitoring and patient outcomes in this high-risk population."
41253383,Are We Overreporting Post-Op Sepsis? The Difference Between Reported and Verified Rates of Post-Ureteroscopy Sepsis Using the Sepsis 3 Criteria at a Single Institution.,2025,"Introduction: Ureteroscopy (URS) is the most commonly performed surgery for the management of renal stones. Post-URS sepsis has been reported to be around 5%, but most studies rely on purchased datasets or electronic medical record (EMR) data that pull data based on billing codes of sepsis without clinical verifications. This study aims to evaluate the true incidence of sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria at a single tertiary care institution. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on all URS procedures at a single tertiary care institution from 2021 to 2022, including both Medicare and private insurance patients >/=18 years old. The EMR was queried for URS procedure codes and readmission within 30 days post-procedure with a sepsis diagnosis code. All other procedures, including URS during percutaneous nephrolithotomy, were excluded. Each identified case was evaluated for sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria, including sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA). Results: A total of 1316 patients underwent URS. Nineteen patients were identified with a sepsis diagnosis, giving an initial post-URS sepsis rate of 1.44%. After EMR verification, 5 patients were excluded, leaving 14 (1.06%) patients with a diagnosis code of sepsis. Using Sepsis-3 criteria, only 6 (0.44%) met the diagnosis. Conclusions: This retrospective review identified only 0.44% of patients with a true post-URS sepsis within 30 days using Sepsis-3 criteria. The difference in our rate from the initial query and current literature highlights the need for accurate clinical diagnosis and documentation of sepsis."
41253335,[Spontaneous Esophageal Rupture Diagnosed as Pneumothorax at First:Report of a Case].,2025,"We experienced a case of idiopathic esophageal rupture, which can easily become severe. The patient was a 63-year-old man. At the initial visit, he was diagnosed with pneumothorax, but computed tomography(CT) showed mediastinal emphysema and esophagography showed perforation, which led to the diagnosis of the above disease. Surgery was performed more than 24 hours after the initial diagnosis. The perforation was closed with sutures and covered with mediastinal pleura. An enterostomy was added at the same time. Postoperatively, pneumonia and pleural effusion were observed, but the patient was discharged from the hospital without serious complications due to systemic management including measures against sepsis and respiratory complications and nutritional management. In the postoperative management of this disease, it is important to pay attention to systemic management such as nutritional management as well as countermeasures against infection and respiratory complications."
41253221,Premature rupture of the membranes in twin pregnancies: Maternal and fetal outcomes.,2026,"AIM: To analyse outcomes of twin pregnancies complicated by membranes rupture between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation. METHODS: Retrospective matched cohort study on twin pregnancies with premature membranes rupture, through review of clinical records at the Policlinico S. Orsola di Bologna, a tertiary hospital, between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS: 171 twin pregnancies were admitted, over 10 years, with a diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes PPROM (fluid pooling on speculum and/or Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein1 positive on vaginal secretions and oligohydramnios at ultrasound). The maternal and fetal outcomes of these pregnancies were compared to those of uneventful 178 twin pregnancies. There was no difference on risk factors. The mean gestational age at PROM was 33.9 weeks. PPROM newborns showed a lower birth weight (2072 +/- 515 g vs. 2384 +/- 454, p < 0.001), a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (45.6 % vs 22.2 %, p < 0.001), and a higher rate of adverse outcomes, even if it did not achieve statistical significance (crude OR: 3.05, 95 % CI: 2.04-4.56; adjusted OR: 1.45, 95 % CI: 0.87-2.41). No cases of sepsis were found. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of twin pregnancies no significative risk factors for premature rupture of membranes were found. Although PROM is known to increase infectious morbidity, not all patients will develop these complications. PROM in twin pregnancies does not appear to be an independent risk factor for adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes when the effect of prematurity is accounted for. Strategies to prolong pregnancy, when feasible, may mitigate adverse neonatal outcomes associated with PPROM in twin pregnancies."
41252950,Assessment of endocan as a prognostic biomarker in septic calves with diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli K99().,2025,"This study aimed to determine the prognostic impact of serum Endocan levels due to E. coli K99(+) driven systemic inflamatuary response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis (SE) and septic shock (SS). The samples were with 24 diarrhoeic calves and 8 health calves aged 0-7 days. The diarrhoeic calves were divided equally into three groups as the SS group, the SE group and the SIRS group. Repeated serum samples were collected at the 0th, 3rd and 6th hours. The collected samples were used to analyse Endocan and certain proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta ve IL-6) and acute phase proteins (SAA and Hp). A statistically meaningful difference was observed between the serum Endocan levels of the groups (P < 0.001). The E. coli infected diarrhoeic calves in the SS group had Endocan levels higher than others in other groups. Also, as a prognostic value, a statistically meaningful difference was observed between the repeated Endocan concentrations collected from dead and surviving calves (P < 0.01, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). When the cut-off point for Endocan 6th hour tests was considered > 131.92, the AUC value was 0.825, the sensitivity was %81.82, the specificity was %77.2, +LR: 3.60, -LR: 0.24 (P < 0.05). As a result, in repeated analysis, serum Endocan levels were shown to be a rigorous indicator of the severity of inflammation in diarrhoeic calves and mortality when the positive correlation between other proinflammatory cytokine and acute phase proteins was taken into consideration."
41252907,Plug-in paper biosensors for the rapid detection of multiple sepsis biomarkers in blood at the emergency department.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis can rapidly progress to life-threatening septic shock if specialized care is not provided promptly. In many cases, the first healthcare contact is a triage nurse, who assesses the urgency of medical evaluation. However, current triage protocols lack tools for accurate sepsis identification, potentially delaying critical interventions. RESULTS: We present Plug-In biosensors capable of simultaneous detecting two key sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), directly from blood samples. The biosensor integrates a cap that connects to a sample pad, enabling rapid, user-friendly operation suitable for point-of-care use in the Emergency Department. The sensors achieved limits of detection below clinical cut-offs to identify sepsis (0.2 ng mL(-1) for PCT and 0.1 pg mL(-1) for IL-6 in blood diluted 1:100). When applied to patients classified within triage levels 2 and 3 in an Emergency Department cohort, the biosensors demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. Notably, the biosensors successfully identified septic patients who experienced delays in consultation after triage. SIGNIFICANCE: Plug-In biosensors provide a rapid and accessible diagnostic platform for early sepsis detection at the point of triage. Their implementation could enable earlier activation of Code Sepsis, ensuring timely care for patients requiring urgent treatment."
41252746,Predicting Pediatric Sepsis and Mortality Using Wearable Device Data and Machine Learning in Bangladesh.,2026,"Sepsis disproportionately impacts children in low-resource settings, where diagnostic tools like the Phoenix Sepsis Score (PSS) are constrained by reliance on laboratory testing. The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of continuous physiological data from low-cost wearable biosensors and machine learning models to predict pediatric sepsis, septic shock, and mortality in a low-resource, intensive care setting. This prospective observational single-site study analyzed 96 pediatric intensive care unit patients with suspected sepsis in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Physiological data were collected using a wearable biosensor patch, whereas clinical exams, laboratory tests, and PSS criteria identified sepsis, septic shock, and mortality. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models were developed and validated through leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) using biosensor data. Our clinical diagnostic model for sepsis using biosensor-only features demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 (null AUROC = 0.58). For septic shock, the model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.85 (null AUROC = 0.61). The mortality model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.87 (null AUROC = 0.64). Sensitivity analyses showed improvement of AUROC to 0.89 for prediction of sepsis with manual recorded oxygen saturation (SpO2) included. Although models were trained and tested retrospectively with internal validation, findings demonstrate the potential of wearable biosensors to support pediatric sepsis diagnosis without reliance on advanced diagnostics. These results encourage further external validation with larger, multisite cohorts and real-time mobile health (mHealth) integration to support clinical use in low-resource settings."
41252582,Rectal swab screening for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection following liver transplantation (LT) has been increasing. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the utility of rectal swab screening for CRKP in this patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively collected rectal swab screening data from 472 liver transplant recipients between June 2018 and December 2023. Subsequently, we analyzed the risk factors associated with CRKP bloodstream infections (BSIs) and assessed the incidence of CRKP BSIs following an intervention involving a combination therapy of tigecycline and polymyxin. RESULTS: Among the 472 liver transplant recipients, 38 (8.1%) tested positive for CRKP in rectal swab screening. Univariate analysis identified severe hepatitis (P = 0.008), delayed recovery of transplanted liver function (P = 0.006), and the use of anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (P = 0.020) as significant risk factors for CRKP BSIs. The incidence of bloodstream infection was significantly lower in recipients who received the intervention treatment compared to those who did not (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Rectal swab screening in liver transplant recipients provides early warning for the development of CRKP BSIs. Early intervention in high-risk patients with positive rectal swab results may effectively reduce the incidence of CRKP BSIs."
41252431,"Serial C-reactive Protein and Blood Culture in the Diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis among Babies with Risk Factors for Sepsis at Uniosun Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis (NNS) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality among newborns, especially in developing countries. Early identification of risk factors is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to investigate utility of serial C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood culture in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis (NNS) among babies with risk factors for sepsis. METHODOLOGY: All consecutive term babies with maternal and/or neonatal risk factors for sepsis with or without initial symptoms were studied. Blood culture was done for all the participants. The CRP I was done at admission, CRP II at 48 hours and CRP III at 72 hours (a total of 3 samples). The value of CRP >/=10mg/l was considered abnormal. RESULTS: Of 106 participants, 35 (33%) had positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus aureus being the prevalent organism. The sensitivity of CRP at the cut off >/=10mg/l was 60%, 69.7%, and 66.7% for CRP I, CRP II and CRP III, with negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.6%,72.2% and 73.8%, respectively. Abnormal temperature, respiratory distress and convulsion at presentation were significantly associated with positive blood culture (p= 0.002, 0.014 and 0.009, respectively). Logistic regression identified abnormal temperature and delivery outside the hospital facility as being significantly related to elevated CRP values (p= 0.027, 0.016). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of utilization of serial CRP tests in the early detection of sepsis in neonates with risk factors."
41252417,PPI-based screening of hub genes related to sepsis migration/pyroptosis and immune infiltration analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis incidence is rising, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: Three GEO datasets (GSE154918, GSE32707, GSE54514) were analyzed after batch correction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and those related to pyroptosis/migration were cross-analyzed. Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG) and interaction networks (PPI, mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-TF, mRNA-drug) were constructed. External validation used GSE57065, excluding non-significant genes. ROC analysis and immune infiltration were performed. RESULTS: 3566 DEGs (1715 up, 1851 down) were identified, with 23 linked to pyroptosis/migration. Enrichment analysis highlighted roles in cell adhesion, cytokine regulation, and pathways like IL-17, TNF, and Toll-like receptor signaling. mRNA-miRNA interactions for 12 key genes were predicted. After validation, eight key genes remained: TLR2, SIRT1, PTGS2, MAPK14, IL18, ICAM1, CD274, and CASP3. Immune infiltration revealed varied effects on MAPK14. CONCLUSION: Key gene alterations may serve as sepsis biomarkers, and miRNA dysregulation could play a critical role in sepsis pathophysiology."
41251923,A comprehensive review of infection risks and management in hemodialysis access sites.,2026,"Infections at hemodialysis access sites remain a critical challenge in managing end-stage renal disease patients, significantly affecting morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on risk factors, surveillance methods, diagnostic approaches, treatment strategies, and preventive measures for these infections. Through systematic analysis of literature from major databases up to July 2024, we explore infection-related complications, pathogenic agents, and management strategies. Staphylococcus aureus emerges as a primary pathogen, with concerning increases in multidrug-resistant strains. The review emphasizes the superior safety profile of arteriovenous fistulas compared to central venous catheters, highlighting the importance of access type selection. Continuous monitoring and early detection through physical examinations and specialized tests are crucial. Diagnostic accuracy is optimized by combining clinical assessment with laboratory testing and imaging studies. Treatment strategies focus on empiric systemic antibiotic therapy, guided by local epidemiology and culture results, often necessitating catheter removal for persistent infections. Preventive measures, including strict adherence to aseptic techniques and targeted use of antimicrobial locks, are detailed. The study advocates for a multifaceted approach to infection management, emphasizing multidisciplinary collaboration and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Promising future directions, such as novel antimicrobial surfaces and lock solutions, offer potential for further reducing infection risks. This review provides valuable insights for healthcare providers, aiming to improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for hemodialysis-dependent patients through enhanced infection control strategies."
41251372,Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems as definitive treatment for hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in Taiwan.,2025,"Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) can cause serious community-acquired pyogenic infections and is prevalent in Asian countries. Unlike classical K. pneumoniae, which is usually multidrug resistant, hvKp is usually antimicrobial-sensitive. However, the optimal definitive treatment for hvKp bacteremia remains unclear, with carbapenems often used due to severe conditions. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with hvKp bacteremia treated with carbapenems and non-carbapenems in Taiwan. This retrospective study included patients with monomicrobial hvKp bacteremia treated with appropriate definitive therapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017. K. pneumoniae isolates carrying rmpA/rmpA2 genes were defined as hypervirulent strains. A multivariate logistic regression model and propensity score-matched analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for 28-day mortality. A total of 236 patients with hvKp bacteremia were identified, and 52 patients received carbapenems. The non-carbapenem group had a lower 28-day mortality than that in the carbapenem group (10.3% versus 23.1%, P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis showed definitive carbapenem therapy was not associated with 28-day mortality (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.47-4.10; P = 0.549). Among 90 patients with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score >/=15, definitive therapy with carbapenems was still not associated with 28-day mortality (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 0.58 to 12.00; P = 0.212). The propensity score-matched analyses yielded similar results. In conclusion, definitive carbapenem therapy for hvKp bacteremia was not associated with a survival benefit compared with non-carbapenem therapy, even in critically ill patients. The study provides valuable insights into antimicrobial stewardship in endemic regions of hvKp."
41250274,The Recent Rise of Streptococcus Pyogenes Group A-Related Deaths in Cook County : A Case Series.,2026,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a gram-positive bacterium that causes a spectrum of illnesses, ranging from mild infections such as pharyngitis and impetigo to severe invasive diseases, including necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock. Surveillance data from the United States and Europe indicate a marked post-COVID-19 pandemic increase in invasive GAS infections. At the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office (CCMEO), a retrospective review (2015-2025) identified 26 fatal GAS cases, with a significant surge in the postpandemic period. Postmortem diagnosis relies on cultures from sterile sites and histologic examination to confirm infection and minimize contamination artifacts. Most cases demonstrated rapid clinical progression, underscoring the high lethality of invasive GAS. As a secondary objective, postmortem pharyngeal swabs were collected in pediatric cases with suspected GAS infection and tested using a rapid antigen assay; all results were negative and confirmed by culture. These findings suggest the test may be useful for ruling out infection in negative cases, though the sensitivity in confirmed positives remains undetermined. This study highlights the essential role of forensic pathologists in detecting and documenting invasive GAS infections, thereby supporting public health surveillance, outbreak monitoring, and preventive strategies. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnostic sampling, and sustained vigilance are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality from this pathogen."
41250133,Autoimmune aplastic anemia- a rare and devastating presentation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus Erythematous (SLE) with its multisystem manifestations can sometimes throw the treating team into scientific oblivion. Bone marrow suppression increases the susceptibility to infection and life-threatening bleeding manifestations and hence timely diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving in these patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report such a young case of SLE who presented with anasarca, polyarthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations. She was initially managed with steroids along with the evaluation of subnephrotic proteinuria with renal biopsy. Thereafter the disease followed a treacherous course with new onset pancytopenia and worsening renal parameters. It heralded the development of petechiae over the body and gum bleeding. Pulse steroids with broad spectrum antimicrobials were started considering sepsis or autoimmune pancytopenia. Her blood counts worsened further. Bone marrow examination revealed autoimmune aplastic anemia while renal biopsy showed class IV nephritis. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and cyclophosphamide. Subsequently, she responded to the therapy and her blood counts and renal function gradually improved. On follow up, anasarca has resolved completely with normal blood and renal parameters. CONCLUSION: Timely aggressive therapy can save a life from such devastating conditions like autoimmune aplastic anemia. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41249985,Opportunistic infections by Brucella anthropi and Brucella intermedia: a case series of rare non-brucellosis diseases in Saudi Arabia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Recently reclassified under the Brucella genus, Ochrobactrum species are rare opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised hosts, causing non-brucellosis diseases. They exhibit multi-drug resistance (including AmpC) and often require combination therapy. This is the first study from Saudi Arabia to review infections by Brucella anthropi and Brucella intermedia, focusing on clinical significance, resistance, and outcomes. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted on infections caused by B. anthropi and B. intermedia between January 2016 to December 2024. Data on patient demographics, infection type and location, microbial identification, and resistance patterns were collected. Treatment and therapy duration were reviewed, along with outcome assessment. Analysis of the rate of recovery and in-hospital mortality was performed. RESULTS: Over 8 years, a total of 18 unique cases were identified, after excluding 2 of which were deemed contaminated, totaling 16 cases included, 14 adult and 2 pediatric patients were identified as true infections. Presentations varied between septic shock, respiratory distress, and/or altered mental status. Diagnoses included catheter-related bloodstream infections (n = 9), intra-abdominal infection with or without bacteremia (n = 4), and VAP in the neonate (n = 2), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) (n = 1). B. anthropi was found in eleven (11/16) cases, and B. intermedia in four cases, in addition to one that was not identified to species level. Twelve were monomicrobial (12/16, 75%) and six had polymicrobial growth. Resistance to cephalosporins and piperacillin/tazobactam was observed, but all isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, TMP/SMX, and ciprofloxacin. Three deaths (3/16) were documented, and the remaining thirteen patients survived, and the overall survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: B. anthropi and B. intermedia infections are rare overall, mostly identified in blood cultures with variable clinical presentation. Although it can cause severe sepsis and has beta-lactam resistance, the overall outcome if promptly treated is favorable. The distinction from other brucellosis-causing species (B. melitensis and B. Abortus) is essential. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41249971,Integration of metabolic parameters with SOFA score for mortality risk assessment in elderly sepsis: a derivation study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis mortality remains elevated among elderly populations, yet existing risk stratification tools demonstrate suboptimal predictive accuracy. We explored whether incorporating metabolic parameters into the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score could enhance prognostic discrimination in this vulnerable cohort. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 4,056 elderly sepsis patients (age >/= 65 years) admitted to intensive care units between 2008 and 2019, identified through ICD coding from the MIMIC-IV database. Random forest-based feature selection and SHAP value analysis identified lactate and bicarbonate as influential mortality predictors. We constructed three nested logistic regression models: Model 1 (SOFA alone), Model 2 (SOFA plus lactate), and Model 3 (SOFA plus lactate and bicarbonate). Multiple imputation addressed missing data. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Restricted cubic spline regression characterized nonlinear mortality associations. RESULTS: Twenty-eight-day mortality occurred in 1,259 patients (31%). Model 3 achieved superior discrimination (AUC 0.785, 95% CI 0.770-0.801) compared to SOFA alone (AUC 0.738, 95% CI 0.722-0.754; difference 0.048, P < 0.001). Compared with Model 1, Model 3 demonstrated substantial reclassification improvement (NRI 0.816, 95% CI 0.733-0.893; IDI 0.077, 95% CI 0.072-0.082; both P < 0.001), with balanced gains in event (NRI + 0.401) and non-event (NRI - 0.415) classification. Sensitivity increased from 0.32 to 0.45 while maintaining comparable specificity (0.91 vs. 0.90). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed nonlinear threshold effects, with mortality risk accelerating sharply beyond SOFA scores of approximately 8 points. Decision curve analysis confirmed clinical utility across relevant threshold probabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating lactate and bicarbonate measurements with SOFA scoring demonstrated improved mortality discrimination in elderly sepsis patients. These hypothesis-generating findings from a single-center derivation cohort require prospective multicenter validation before clinical implementation can be considered. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41249240,Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants with early-onset sepsis.,2025,"This study aimed to develop an effective individualized predictive nomogram for the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants with early-onset sepsis (EOS). A total of 238 premature infants meeting the inclusion criteria of gestational age < 37 weeks and EOS diagnosis, including 71 with NEC and 167 without NEC (NEC incidence: 29.8%), treated at the First Hospital Affiliated to Army Medical University from January, 2016, to September, 2024 were retrospectively enrolled as a modeling cohort. Additionally, 205 preterm with EOS (53 with NEC and 152 with non-NEC, NEC incidence: 25.9%), who were treated at Liaocheng People's Hospital from January, 2014, to September, 2024 were retrospectively enrolled as a validation cohort to assess the predictive efficacy of the model. LASSO-Logistic regression analysis were applied to screen independent predictors, which were subsequently incorporated into a nomogram constructed using R software. Model performance was assessed through receiver operating characteristic analysis, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC). Lasso-logistic regression identified four independent predictors of NEC in premature infants with EOS: chorioamnionitis (OR = 3.07, 95% CI: 1.26-7.48, p = 0.013), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.10-4.41, p = 0.027), lactate level (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.48-2.58, p < 0.001), and white blood cell (WBC) count (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.95, p < 0.001). These factors were integrated into the nomogram. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discriminative ability with the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.793-0.903, sensitivity: 0.820, specificity: 0.761) in the modeling cohort and 0.825 (95% CI: 0.764-0.887, sensitivity: 0.750, specificity: 0.755) in the validation cohort, enabling early risk stratification for targeted clinical monitoring. Calibration curves confirmed good agreement between predicted and observed NEC probabilities (modeling cohort: chi(2) = 3.539, df = 8, p = 0.896; validation cohort: chi(2) = 12.769, df = 8, p = 0.120). DCA and CIC further verified the nomogram's high net clinical benefit, confirming its utility in guiding clinical decision-making. This study establishes a nomogram based on four readily accessible variables to predict NEC in premature infants with EOS. With robust predictive performance, this tool enables early risk stratification of high-risk infants, facilitating timely and targeted monitoring and intervention."
41248741,Interpretable machine learning based comorbidity specific mortality risk score for bloodstream infections.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of sepsis, necessitating early risk stratification during the critical window for effective management. We aimed to develop a model that leverages early-phase clinical data to predict 28-day mortality by integrating longitudinal trends and addressing comorbidity-driven heterogeneity. METHODS: The BSI Heterogeneity Score (BHScore) was developed using machine learning on longitudinal clinical data (first 7 days post-culture) from 2524 BSI patients at Xijing Hospital. The model uses interpretable methods to establish comorbidity-stratified thresholds (global, renal disease, liver disease, metastatic malignancy) to enhance prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The BHScore demonstrated superior discriminatory performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.81-0.91) and temporal stability compared to established scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), representing an improvement of 10% to 25%. Our analysis revealed that coagulation biomarkers have greater prognostic significance in the malignancy subgroup, inflammatory thresholds are more sensitive in the liver disease subgroup, and urea levels exhibit U-shaped mortality curves in the renal disease subgroup. To support clinical application, a freely accessible web tool has been developed. CONCLUSIONS: The BHScore enables the early identification of high-risk BSI patients with diverse comorbidities using straightforward clinical indicators, facilitating timely and targeted interventions to reduce mortality."
41248740,Monocyte iron load correlates with immune suppression and sepsis severity: A longitudinal analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection. In critically ill patients, iron biomarkers are closely linked to outcomes; yet the mechanistic role of iron metabolism in sepsis progression remains unclear. METHOD: To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal clinical study in 20 sepsis patients, tracking plasma iron biomarkers together with monocyte function and iron content over five consecutive days following sepsis onset. Some patients required red blood cell transfusions during the study period. RESULTS: We show that anemia of inflammation is an early and prominent feature of sepsis hallmarked by iron sequestration in blood monocytes, reduced plasma iron levels and anemia. Importantly, increased iron levels in monocytes are detected already at day one following the sepsis diagnosis and the degree of iron accumulation directly correlates with sepsis severity. High monocytic iron levels further correlate with decreased human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) expression on day one, suggestive of monocyte immunosuppression. Furthermore, in iron-loaded septic monocytes mRNA levels of the non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) transporter ZRT/IRT-like Protein 8 were significantly increased, suggesting enhanced uptake of non-transferrin bound iron that may arise from hemolysis. Interestingly, we also show that the total iron binding capacity is an important predictor of sepsis mortality, while transfusions did not correlate with an altered iron and/or inflammatory status. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that early iron accumulation in monocytes is a hallmark of sepsis and is closely linked to disease severity and progression. We expect that improved insights into iron metabolism in sepsis patients may pave the way to improving therapeutic options that balance iron levels and their effects on organ functions in the future."
41248570,Inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and NETosis ameliorates sepsis-induced cardiac injury and reduces myocardial inflammation and apoptosis.,2026,"AIMS: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) lacks effective targeted therapies. This study investigated whether inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis) preserves cardiac function and mitigates inflammation and apoptosis in sepsis. METHODS: We performed analyses of gene-expression microarray datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing to define the SIC landscape, and generated cardiac RNA sequencing in LPS-treated versus control mice to validate microarray signatures. In vitro, we used two complementary models, purified NETs applied to HL-1 cardiomyocytes and HL-1-neutrophil coculture to induce NETs, ROS, inflammation, and apoptosis,to evaluate NET-targeting interventions, including CI-amidine, PAD4 inhibition; Sivelestat, neutrophil elastase inhibition; DNase I, NET degradation. To define NET subtype, we verified that PMA-induced NETs were NADPH oxidase-dependent by demonstrating apocynin sensitivity, and we further showed that the mitochondrial ROS scavenger Mito-TEMPO reduced NET-induced ROS in HL-1 cells. In vivo, mice were assigned to control, CLP, or LPS groups; CLP/LPS mice received vehicle or a NET inhibitor. Echocardiography, plasma LDH/CK-MB, IL-1beta/6/TNF-alpha, cardiac NETs (Ly6G/PAD4, MPO/NE IF) and apoptosis (TUNEL, BAX/BCL-2/cleaved caspase-3) were blindly assessed. RESULTS: Datasets-based analyses highlighted immune activation with programmed cell death enrichment, prominently featuring NETosis pathways. Cardiac RNA sequencing in LPS hearts confirmed upregulation of neutrophil/NET-related signatures. Mechanistically, the induced NETs were NADPH oxidase-dependent. In vitro, both purified NETs intervention and HL-1-neutrophil coculture were used to elicit ROS, inflammatory signaling, and apoptosis, and NET-inducing conditions were consistently attenuated by netosis-targeted interventions. CLP and LPS animal model produced early declines in EF/FS, rises in LDH/CK-MB and proinflammatory cytokines, increased cardiac neutrophil infiltration and NET burden, and enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The neutrophil-targeted interventions reduced cardiac neutrophils and NETs, lowered IL-1beta/IL-6/TNF-alpha, decreased TUNEL positivity and apoptotic signaling, and preserved systolic function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that NETosis and neutrophil infiltration are therapeutically actionable contributors in SIC. Strategies that inhibit NET formation, degrade extracellular DNA, or limit neutrophil recruitment were associated with reduced myocardial inflammation and apoptosis and partial preservation of systolic function. These results provide a theoretical basis for early diagnosis, timely intervention, and improved prognosis in SIC."
41248543,Dopamine versus norepinephrine in fluid-refractory septic shock among preterm neonates: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.,2025,"The present study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of norepinephrine (NE) versus dopamine in achieving early (within 45 min of initiation) reversal of fluid-refractory septic shock in preterm neonates. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in a Level-III tertiary care hospital in Northern India. Fifty neonates born at a gestational age of <37 weeks and diagnosed with fluid-refractory septic shock till 28 days of life were randomly allocated to receive either dopamine infusion (10-20 mug/kg/min) or NE infusion (0.2-0.4 mug/kg/min). We found that the proportion of preterm neonates achieving early (within 45 min of initiation) reversal of septic shock was 11/26 (42.3%) in the dopamine group vs. 15/24 (62.5%) in the NE group, respectively [risk ratio (RR) 0.677; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.392-1.168]. Among secondary outcomes, the proportion of neonates requiring additional vasoactive drugs was significantly less in the NE group, 8/24 (33.3%) vs. the dopamine group, 16/26 (61.5%), respectively (RR 1.846; 95% CI 1.000-3.509, P=.04). Additionally, the probability of requiring additional vasoactive drugs and remaining alive during the hospital stay were significantly higher in the NE group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.66; 95% CI 1.12-2.45, P=.01 by log-rank test]. There was no significant difference in other clinical outcomes. Among preterm neonates with fluid-refractory septic shock, NE (0.2-0.4 mug/kg/min) and dopamine (10-20 mug/kg/min) had comparable efficacy and safety."
41248470,"Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) surveillance outcome programs - bloodstream infections and antimicrobial resistance patterns in Australian children and adolescents, January 2022 - December 2023.",2025,"Between January 2022 and December 2023, there were 1,827 bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates in 1,745 children and adolescents reported to the Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) surveillance outcome programs, with 40% of episodes in children aged < 12 months. Two-thirds of BSIs were community-onset. Of 1,034 gram-negative isolates, 932 (90%) were Enterobacterales. Gram-negative BSI episodes were more commonly community-onset and in children < 12 months of age. Of Enterobacterales isolates, 17.9% were ciprofloxacin resistant; 14.0% were ceftriaxone and/or ceftazidime resistant; 9.5% were gentamicin and/or tobramycin resistant; and 8.9% were piperacillin-tazobactam resistant. Increasing ciprofloxacin resistance was noted, primarily due to the increase in Salmonella Typhi BSI. Overall, 13% of Enterobacterales were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and 18.5% were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Of 601 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 13.6% were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and 5.5% were MDR. Overall, 14.4% of S. aureus isolates were erythromycin resistant; 10.3% were clindamycin resistant; and 5.0% were ciprofloxacin resistant. Erythromycin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA were significantly higher than in methicillin-sensitive isolates. No co-trimoxazole resistant S. aureus was isolated. There were 192 enterococcal isolates reported; 70.8% were E. faecalis and 17.2% were E. faecium. All ampicillin-resistant, vancomycin-resistant, and MDR enterococci were E. faecium. The 2022-2023 AGAR Kids Biennial Report shows relative stability in the antimicrobial resistance landscape within the Australian paediatric population, with few significant differences detected when compared to the 2020-2021 report. Small increases in the proportion of resistant Enterobacterales and Enterococcus spp. isolates highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to inform stewardship and infection prevention interventions."
41248469,Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) Australian Enterococcal Surveillance Outcome Program (AESOP) Bloodstream Infection Annual Report 2024.,2025,"From 1 January to 31 December 2024, fifty-five institutions across Australia participated in the Australian Enterococcal Surveillance Outcome Program (AESOP). The aim of AESOP 2024 was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteraemia isolates in Australia that were antimicrobial resistant, and to determine the molecular epidemiology of the reported Enterococcus faecium isolates. Of the 1,461 unique episodes of enterococcal bacteraemia investigated, 92.5% were caused by either E. faecalis (51.5%) or E. faecium (41.0%). Ampicillin and vancomycin resistance were not detected in E. faecalis but were detected in 96.8% and 44.5% of E. faecium respectively. Five linezolid-resistant E. faecalis isolates were identified, for which the linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 6.0 mg/L to 8.0 mg/L. All five isolates harboured the linezolid resistance optrA gene and were vancomycin susceptible. One linezolid-resistant E. faecium was confirmed with an MIC of 6.0 mg/L. The isolate was vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant and harboured vanA and optrA genes. Overall, 49.8% of E. faecium isolates harboured the vanA and/or the vanB gene: within these isolates, 40.2% harboured vanA, 58.8% harboured vanB, and 1.0% harboured vanA and vanB. The percentage of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium bacteraemia isolates in Australia remains substantially higher than that recorded in most European countries. The E. faecium isolates consisted of 56 multi-locus sequence types (STs); 85.7% of isolates were classified into eight STs, each containing ten or more isolates. The eight STs (ST17, ST78, ST80, ST117, ST555, ST796, ST1421 and ST1424) belonged to clonal complex (CC) 17, a global hospital-adapted polyclonal E. faecium CC, and were found in most Australian jurisdictions. Overall, 54.6% of E. faecium isolates belonging to the eight predominant STs harboured the vanA or vanB gene. AESOP 2024 has shown that enterococcal bacteraemia episodes in Australia continue to be frequently caused by polyclonal ampicillin-resistant high-level gentamicin-resistant vanA- or vanB-positive E. faecium which have limited treatment options."
41248468,Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) Australian Staphylococcus aureus Surveillance Outcome Program (ASSOP) Bloodstream Infection Annual Report 2024.,2025,"From 1 January to 31 December 2024, fifty-five institutions across Australia participated in the Australian Staphylococcus aureus Surveillance Outcome Program (ASSOP). The aim of ASSOP 2024 was to determine the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) isolates in Australia that were antimicrobial resistant, with particular emphasis on methicillin resistance, and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). A total of 3,358 SAB episodes were reported, of which 78.5% were community-onset. Overall, 14.9% of S. aureus were methicillin resistant. The 30-day all-cause mortality associated with methicillin-resistant SAB was 13.7%, which was not significantly different to the 14.1% 30-day all-cause mortality associated with methicillin-susceptible SAB (p = 0.9). With the exception of the beta-lactams and erythromycin, antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was infrequent. However, in addition to the beta-lactams, 34.8% of MRSA were resistant to erythromycin; 28.9% to ciprofloxacin; 13.1% to gentamicin; 11.0% to tetracycline; and 2.7% to cotrimoxazole. A daptomycin-resistant MRSA from New South Wales was identified. The isolate had a daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6.0 mg/L, and was identified as ST5-V, with a S337L MprF mutation. When applying the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints, teicoplanin resistance was detected in three MSSA isolates. Linezolid or vancomycin resistance was not detected. Resistance to the non-beta-lactam antimicrobials was largely attributable to the predominant healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) clone ST22-IV [2B] (EMRSA-15), and to the community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) clone ST45-V [5C2&5], which has acquired resistance to multiple antimicrobials including ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline. Overall, 89.6% of methicillin-resistant SAB episodes were caused by CA-MRSA clones. Although polyclonal, approximately 72% of CA-MRSA clones were characterised as ST93-IV [2B] (Queensland clone), ST5-IV [2B], ST45-V [5C2&5], ST8-IV [2B], ST30-IV [2B], ST1-IV [2B], ST6-IV [2B], ST97-IV [2B] and Panton-Valentine leucocidin positive ST22-IV [2B]. As CA-MRSA is well established in the Australian community, it is important to monitor antimicrobial resistance patterns in community- and healthcare-associated SAB, as this information will guide therapeutic practices in treating S. aureus bacteraemia."
41248467,Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) Australian Gram-negative Surveillance Outcome Program (GnSOP) Bloodstream Infection Annual Report 2024.,2025,"The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric gram-negative pathogens. From 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024, fifty-five hospitals across Australia participated in the Australian Gram-negative Surveillance Outcome Program (GnSOP). A total of 10,340 isolates, comprising Enterobacterales (9,376; 90.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (804; 7.7%) and Acinetobacter species (160; 1.4%), were tested using commercial automated methods. The results were analysed using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (January 2025). Key resistances reported are to the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone in 14.9% of Escherichia coli and 10.5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae complex isolates. Resistance rates to ciprofloxacin were 15.4% for E. coli; 9.7% for the K. pneumoniae complex; 3.8% for the Enterobacter cloacae complex; and 8.8% for P. aeruginosa. Resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 7.5%, 10.3%, 25.2%, and 13.6% for the same four species/complexes, respectively. Thirty-nine Enterobacterales isolates from 38 patients were shown to harbour a carbapenemase gene: 21 with a bla(NDM) gene (bla(NDM-5) [8]; bla(NDM-1) [7]; bla(NDM-7) [6]); eight with bla(IMP-4); four with a bla(OXA-181)-like gene (bla(OXA-181) [2]; bla(OXA-484) [1]; bla(OXA-1205) [1]); three with a bla(OXA-48)-like gene (bla(OXA-48) [2]; bla(OXA-244)); two with bla(KPC-2); and one with bla(NDM-5) + bla(OXA-484). Carbapenemase genes were also detected in two P. aeruginosa isolates (bla(NDM-1) [1]; bla(GES-5) [1])."
41248095,Does oXiris Matter? A Comparative Outcome Study in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy-Treated Septic Intensive Care Unit Patients.,2026,"<p>Introduction: Sepsis and septic shock frequently lead to acute kidney injury and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The oXiris hemofilter has cytokine- and endotoxin-adsorptive properties that may improve outcomes, but evidence remains inconclusive. This study compared the clinical outcomes of septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated with CRRT using oXiris versus standard filters. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study at a tertiary ICU in Istanbul between January 2019 and June 2024. Adult septic patients requiring CRRT within 24 h of ICU admission were included. Patients were treated with either oXiris or standard CRRT filters (M-100/M-150) for >/=16 h. The primary endpoint was ICU mortality; secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU length of stay, and trends in inflammatory and biochemical markers. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients were analyzed (133 oXiris, 227 standard filters). Despite higher baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate in the oXiris group, ICU survival was significantly higher (61.7% vs. 48.9%, p = 0.019). After adjustment, oXiris use remained independently associated with improved survival (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.60, p = 0.020). Total CRRT duration was markedly shorter in the oXiris group (56.4 vs. 107.4 h, p < 0.001). VFDs were similar between groups. Inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT) remained elevated in oXiris patients through day 5, while hemodynamic stabilization (lactate decline, norepinephrine reduction) was more pronounced. Platelet counts decreased in both groups without recovery. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with sepsis treated using the oXiris filter exhibited significantly higher ICU survival rates, despite higher mechanical ventilation duration and ICU length of stay. However, persistent elevations in CRP and PCT, along with thrombocytopenia, suggest that these markers may not fully reflect therapeutic response. While oXiris use was associated with reduced ICU mortality, further randomized trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and account for potential confounders. </p>."
41247051,Identification of Candida parapsilosis sensu lato and antifungal susceptibility testing of candidemia patients in a tertiary-care hospital in Malaysia.,2026,"Candidemia is the fourth most common nosocomial bloodstream infection and the most prevalent nosocomial fungal infection. Candida parapsilosis complex is the second most frequently identified species from blood samples in different countries worldwide, exceeding the prevalence of Candida albicans in some hospitals. Proper conventional identification of C. parapsilosis to subspecies level and confirming this identification using molecular methods such as amplifying and sequencing the internal transcribed spacer-polymerase chain reaction (ITS-PCR) help promptly in final diagnosis of candidemia. In addition, antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) is becoming mandatory for each individualized sample; a reliable estimation of antifungal susceptibility of Candida causing bloodstream infections is increasingly important to track changes in the antifungal sensitivity/resistance of Candida species and define the burden of antifungal-resistant strains. Here, molecular research was conducted to identify the subspecies of C. parapsilosis and identify patterns of antifungal sensitivity/resistance in a tertiary-care hospital in Malaysia. This study involved a total of 50 C. parapsilosis complex isolates recovered from catheters and blood cultures of patients. Subspecies identification was conducted by conventional methods and confirmed by ITS-PCR, a molecular-based technique. Antifungal susceptibility to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins was tested by E-test method, and results were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute clinical breakpoints. Three different subspecies of C. parapsilosis complex were identified: 40 C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, 9 Candida orthopsilosis, and 1 Candida metapsilosis. Most of the strains were susceptible to all antifungals studied, with only a few resistant cases observed. However, despite the limited number of resistant isolates, this study highlights the continuous need to conduct species identification and AFST studies to assess and monitor the growing burden of candidemia, control the effect of potential antifungal resistance, and implement regional surveillance programs to prevent further rise in candidemia rates. Therefore, it is of substantial significance to carry out such types of studies in different countries all over the world to understand the great burden of candidemia and emergence of resistant strains. Early diagnosis of fungal infections in general and candidemia specifically is of essential importance for the proper treatment, prevention, and management of nosocomial fungal infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.IMPORTANCECandida parapsilosis is an emerging cause of bloodstream infections in hospitals, particularly in vulnerable patients using catheters or medical devices. These infections are serious and can be difficult to treat, especially if the yeast becomes resistant to common antifungal medications. In this study, we examined Candida samples from a Malaysian hospital to identify the specific types of C. parapsilosis and test their resistance to antifungal drugs. We found that most strains were still sensitive to treatment, but some showed early signs of resistance, especially to itraconazole. This work highlights the urgent need for hospitals to regularly monitor fungal infections and adjust treatment plans based on up-to-date lab testing. Understanding which strains are present and how they respond to drugs helps doctors choose the most effective treatment, improves patient outcomes, and supports infection control efforts to prevent future outbreaks of resistant fungal infections."
41246299,Portfolio analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data unravels immune cells and telomere-related biomarkers in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of sepsis is essential to reducing mortality. Immune cells and telomeres play important roles in sepsis, but their mechanisms were still unclear. This study aimed to explore the value of immune cells and telomere-related genes in sepsis. METHODS: In this study, the transcriptomic data with sepsis and control samples were obtained from public database. Multiple methods including differential expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 101-machine learning algorithm combinations were used to identify biomarkers which related to the immune cells and telomere. Afterwards, a nomogram was constructed to assess the clinical predictive value of biomarkers. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), regulatory network construction and drug prediction analysis were adopted to demonstrate the role of biomarkers in sepsis. The key cells were also identified using a single-cell dataset. Finally, the expression of biomarkers was further validated in clinical samples by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: This study obtained a total of 4 biomarkers (MYO10, SULT1B1, MKI67, and CREB5), and the analysis of nomogram showed that the biomarkers had good clinical predictive value to sepsis. The enrichment analysis results revealed that the four biomarkers were enriched in the ribosome pathway. Besides, a lncRNAs-miRNAs-biomarkers network was constructed for the four biomarkers. Finally, we obtained a candidate drug (MS-275) and a key cell (CD16+ and CD14+ monocytes) respectively based on drug prediction and cell identification analysis. In addition, we found that the expression levels of CREB5 and SULT1B1 had significant changes during the process of key cell differentiation. The RT-qPCR results showed biomarkers were upregulated in the sepsis group, consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results. CONCLUSION: This study identified 4 biomarkers, namely MYO10, SULT1B1, MKI67, and CREB5 and explored the pathogenesis of sepsis, providing new insights for potential treatment strategies by integrating transcriptomic data and single-cell analysis."

41246143,Disulfidptosis-associated gene signatures in sepsis: a diagnostic model based on an LLM-assisted bioinformatics analysis.,2025,"PURPOSE: This study investigated the involvement of disulfidptosis in the pathophysiology of sepsis by applying a bioinformatics analysis assisted by large language models (LLMs). METHODS: Based on DeepSeek R1 and retrieval-augmented generation technology, a deep retrieval architecture was developed for extracting disulfidptosis-related genes. An intersection of genes from LLM extraction, manual extraction, and datasets was included for bioinformatics analyses. Using DeepSeek R1, we synthesized a multi-step bioinformatics protocol from prior publications. The analyses were then performed according to the protocol. Key gene candidates were identified using multiple machine learning models, and validation was performed in a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model of sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 21 disulfidptosis-related genes were included for bioinformatics analyses. Nine bioinformatics techniques were integrated based on the LLM summarization of two key references. Thirteen disulfidptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in sepsis. Based on these DEGs, sepsis patients were classified into two molecular subgroups with distinct immune profiles. Among the machine learning models evaluated, the support vector machine achieved the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.989). Five hub genes-FSTL1, SELP, PPBP, ITGA2B, and PF4-were selected as key biomarkers. Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated expression of these genes in the sepsis mice compared with their sham counterparts. CONCLUSION: Our study assisted bioinformatics analysis with large language models and revealed a critical role for disulfidptosis in sepsis. A high-performance diagnostic model was developed, and five genes were validated as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

41245930,"A Retrospective Evaluation of the Effects of Cumulative Fluid Balance on Mortality and Morbidity in Critically Ill Patients in a Tertiary Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Brisbane, Australia.",2025,"Introduction The administration of fluid therapy and fluid management is common in the intensive care unit (ICU). There is an increasing trend toward an association between fluid balance and patient outcomes, including mortality. Despite extensive research, the best approach to fluid management remains uncertain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a more positive cumulative fluid balance (CFB) is associated with increased hospital mortality in ICU patients. Design and setting This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary ICU (PAH; Brisbane, Australia) from January 2015 to June 2021. Fourteen thousand three hundred thirty-nine admissions were screened, from which 2,392 individual patient admissions were analyzed. Main outcome measures Patients were grouped into quintiles based on 120 hours of CFB. This time frame was defined a priori. Actual mortality (Intensive Care Unit and Hospital) was compared to predicted mortality (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III) and Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death (ANZROD)). Results Hospital mortality increased progressively from 13.5% in the least fluid positive group to 38.8% in the most fluid positive group. When adjusted for disease severity scores, the actual mortality when compared to predicted outcomes was lowest in the less fluid positive quintiles and increased progressively to become greater than predicted in the most fluid positive quintile. The more fluid positive patients had higher APACHE III scores, were more likely to require higher doses of vasopressors, had more severe kidney injury, more requirement for dialysis and invasive mechanical ventilation, were more likely to be postoperative, and had a trauma diagnosis. The less fluid positive patients required lower doses of vasopressors, less invasive mandatory ventilation, and had longer ICU and hospital stays, and more furosemide use, with the diagnosis of sepsis over-represented in this group. Conclusions A higher CFB at 120 hours of ICU admission was associated with increased hospital mortality, even after adjustment for illness severity. These findings support the need for prospective studies to define optimal fluid strategies in critically ill patients."
41245863,Diagnostic utility of neurogenic biomarkers in differentiating sepsis with and without associated encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analytic approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent complication of sepsis, manifesting as acute brain dysfunction and often resulting in persistent cognitive deficits, neurological impairment, and increased mortality. Timely and accurate diagnosis of SAE is essential to guide therapeutic decisions and improve clinical outcomes. In recent years, neurogenic biomarkers have emerged as potential serum-based indicators for the diagnosis and progression monitoring of SAE. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted from inception to 30 April 2025. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies (50 arms) were included. Random-effects analysis revealed significant differences in serum NSE levels between SAE and NE adult patients (WMD = 6.82; 95% CI: 5.43, 8.21; P < 0.001), S100beta levels (WMD = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.60; P < 0.001), GFAP levels in the SAE group (WMD = 62.28; 95% CI: 45.42, 79.14; P < 0.001), TAU levels in the SAE individuals (WMD = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.51; P < 0.001), UCH-L1 levels in SAE patients (WMD = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.51; P < 0.001), APACHE II scores in the SAE group (WMD = 6.30; 95% CI: 4.61, 7.99; P < 0.001), and SOFA scores in SAE (WMD = 3.65; 95% CI: 2.96, 4.34; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum levels of neurogenic biomarkers may serve as potential predictors of SAE and are associated with increased mortality in septic patients. These biomarkers show promise as reliable, minimally invasive tools for diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of SAE. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to substantial heterogeneity across the included studies."
41245592,Alkaline Phosphatase to Albumin Ratio as a Novel Predictor of All-Cause Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase to albumin ratio (APAR) is an emerging prognostic indicator for sepsis, cancer, and coronary artery disease. However, the predictive value of APAR in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been investigated yet. Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between APAR and the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with AF. METHODS: The data of AF patients were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with AF were divided into three groups according to the APAR tertiles. Study outcomes were defined as 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare the survival rates between groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to investigate the association between APAR and all-cause mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to evaluate the predictive value of APAR for study outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1105 critically ill patients with AF were enrolled in the study. The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with the highest APAR had the lowest survival rate. The Cox regression analysis indicated that the highest APAR tertile was significantly associated with 28-day (HR, 1.64 [95% CI 1.20-2.25]; p=0.002) and 365-day (HR, 1.87 [95% CI 1.47-2.39]; p < 0.001) all-cause mortality. Nonlinear relationships between APAR and 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality were illustrated based on the RCS curves. The areas under the ROC curves for predicting 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality were 0.617 and 0.642, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggested that APAR was a simple biomarker for the prognosis in patients with AF."
41245394,Utility of Plasma Myostatin as a Predictive Biomarker for Post Intensive Care Syndrome in Patients With Sepsis.,2025,"AIM: Post intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a critical issue in postsepsis care; however, no reliable biomarker exists to predict PICS. We hypothesized that plasma myostatin, a cytokine involved in muscle and brain function, could serve as a predictive biomarker for PICS. METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study included adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Plasma myostatin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on days 1, 3-4, and 6-7 after sepsis diagnosis and ICU admission. PICS was assessed 6 months post-ICU discharge via telephone interviews using the Barthel Index, Short-Memory Questionnaire score, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine whether myostatin levels independently predicted PICS. Predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled (mean age: 71 +/- 14 years; median SOFA score 7 [IQR: 6-11]). Plasma myostatin concentrations were 544 (311-1015) pg/mL on day 1, 495 (302-651) pg/mL on days 3-4, and 536 (385-817) pg/mL on days 6-7. Decreased plasma myostatin levels on day 1 and on days 6-7 contributed to identifying patients with cognitive and physical impairments, respectively (p = 0.04). A decreased plasma myostatin level on day 1 yielded an AUC of 0.70 for predicting cognitive impairment, whereas the day 6-7 level yielded an AUC of 0.76 for predicting physical impairment. CONCLUSION: Lower plasma myostatin concentrations in the acute phase of sepsis may serve as a biomarker for predicting PICS-related physical and cognitive impairments."
41245251,Unusual neutrophilic morphology in influenza-A-induced septic shock: Blue-green inclusions and phagocytosis of autologous cells in a toddler.,2025,"Influenza A virus is a major cause of seasonal respiratory illness, typically self-limiting in children. However, in rare instances, it can lead to fulminant systemic complications such as acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), sepsis-induced shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We report a rare case of a 2-year-3-month-old girl who developed sepsis-induced shock secondary to influenza A infection. The patient presented with sudden high fever, frequent seizures, impaired consciousness, and respiratory failure. Rapid clinical deterioration ensued, with evidence of profound hyperinflammatory response, coagulopathy, hepatic and myocardial injury, and lactic acidosis. Neurophysiological findings were consistent with ANE. Notably, peripheral blood smear revealed two rare hematologic features: blue-green neutrophilic inclusions (BGNIs) and neutrophilic phagocytosis of both lymphocytes and erythrocytes. These findings-unprecedented in the context of pediatric influenza A infection-may reflect severe immune dysregulation and oxidative stress. Despite aggressive multidisciplinary interventions, the patient succumbed to MODS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) on day 4 of illness. This is the first reported pediatric case of influenza A infection with concurrent BGNIs and neutrophilic hemophagocytosis in peripheral blood. These morphological abnormalities may serve as hematological markers of life-threatening systemic inflammation in viral sepsis. Awareness and prompt recognition of these features may aid in prognostication and clinical decision making for critically ill children with influenza."
41244772,Gut-lung immunometabolic crosstalk in sepsis: from microbiota to respiratory failure.,2025,"Sepsis is a systemic immune-metabolic disorder syndrome caused by infection, in which gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a central role in the occurrence and development of multi-organ dysfunction. This paper systematically elaborates on the bidirectional regulatory mechanism of the ""gut-lung axis"" in sepsis. Gut microbiota dysregulation damages the gut barrier function, reduces the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and increases endotoxin translocation. Subsequently, it activates alveolar macrophage polarization, promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and leads to an imbalance in the Treg/Th17 cell ratio, ultimately exacerbating the pathological process of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Conversely, the pulmonary inflammatory response can also aggravate gut barrier damage through circulating inflammatory mediators, forming a vicious cycle. Mechanistically, HIF-1alpha, mTOR, and Sirtuins do not act in isolation. Instead, they jointly regulate the metabolic fate of immune cells through spatiotemporally dynamic interactions. During the evolution of sepsis, these signals exhibit opposite regulatory polarities during the hyper-inflammatory phase and the immunosuppressive phase, and mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress further amplify the inflammatory cascade reaction. Preclinical research evidence shows that microbiota-based intervention measures (including probiotic preparations, fecal microbiota transplantation, and SCFA supplementation) and vagus nerve electrical stimulation can effectively alleviate sepsis-related lung injury and improve prognosis, but there is significant individual heterogeneity in their therapeutic effects. Future research should not be restricted to descriptive associations. Instead, it is essential to conduct in-depth analyses of the specific logic of the aforementioned signaling networks in terms of cell types, subcellular compartments, and disease course timings, and clarify their context-dependent controversies to promote the transformation of mechanistic understanding into precision treatment. Meanwhile, research efforts should focus on constructing a multi-omics dynamic biomarker system integrating metagenomics, metabolomics, and immunophenotyping analysis and designing clinical trials through precise patient stratification to facilitate the clinical translation of individualized treatment strategies based on gut-lung axis regulation."
41244407,"Fabrication of Disposable Thin-Film Electrodes via Shadow Mask Technique for Sensitive Point-of-Care Detection of C‑Reactive Protein, a Sepsis Biomarker.",2025,"Point-of-care testing for sepsis refers to diagnostic technologies that rapidly and effectively detect sepsis using specific biomarkers. The development of thin-film electrodes (TFEs) for biosensing applications has been frequently reported in recent years. Notably, TFEs have been employed to develop biosensors for C-reactive protein (CRP), a key biomarker of sepsis. This study presents a straightforward and rapid method for fabricating TFEs on substrates using a shadow mask technique. The process employs commercially available polyvinyl chloride sticker film, serving as a disposable shadow mask, to create a three-electrode system (working electrode (WE), counter electrode (CE), and reference electrode (RE) on a poly-(methyl methacrylate) substrate. The sequential deposition of 20 nm of titanium (Ti) and 120 nm of gold (Au) formed the WE and CE, while the RE was fabricated by depositing titanium and silver (Ag). The fabricated TFEs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, revealing notable differences in surface morphology and elemental composition. A specific aptamer for the CRP biomarker is immobilized on the surface of a TFE. The electrochemical biosensor demonstrated a linear range of 0.02-0.9 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 6.5 pg/mL, indicating high sensitivity for detecting the CRP biomarker."

41244105,Association of Hematocrit and Albumin Difference With Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Patients With Continuous Mechanical Ventilation: Evidence From MIMIC-IV Database.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the difference in hematocrit and albumin (HCT-ALB) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among patients undergoing continuous mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This research utilized the data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary outcome was VAP occurred. HCT-ALB levels were divided into three groups according to the quantile: < -1.10; -1.10-5.30; >/= 5.30. All patients with continuous mechanical ventilation were categorized into two groups: those who developed VAP and those who did not. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between HCT-ALB and VAP risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive ability. To further assess the robustness of the findings, subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: In our study, a total of 3021 patients were enrolled, and among them, 361 patients experienced VAP. Multivariate logistic regression showed that taking HCT-ALB < -1.10 as reference, HCT-ALB >/= 5.30 was linked to an increased risk of VAP in patients undergoing continuous mechanical ventilation (odds ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.81). The ROC curve demonstrated approximately moderate predictive ability. This association remained robust in subgroups of male, quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score </= 2, not using antibiotics, having oral care, and no history of trauma injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: HCT-ALB, as an easily measurable indicator, was associated with the risk of VAP in patients with continuous mechanical ventilation."
41242037,Superiority of a combined antithrombin and activated protein C model for predicting coagulopathy and mortality in pneumonia-related sepsis: A prospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia-related sepsis is frequently complicated by coagulation disorders, which significantly increase mortality risk. The current ISTH criteria demonstrate limited sensitivity in diagnosing pneumonia-specific coagulopathy, and the mechanisms underlying clinical phenotypic heterogeneity remain poorly understood. There is a growing need to identify novel biomarkers that can enhance the early detection and stratification of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), particularly in its non-overt stages. AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (aPC) testing for predicting clinical deterioration and early DIC progression in adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 86 adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). All patients underwent testing of AT and aPC upon enrollment. The predictive value of this biomarker combination was evaluated for the development of overt DIC within 72 h and 28-day all-cause mortality using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Among 86 adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis (median age 65 years; 56.9 % male), 18 (20.9 %) progressed to overt DIC within 72 h, and the 28-day mortality rate was 26.7 % (23/86). Compared with survivors, non-survivors exhibited significantly lower antithrombin activity (median 65 % vs. 78 %; P = 0.005) and higher activated protein C levels (median 127 pg/mL vs. 93.9 pg/mL; P < 0.001). Notably, the presence of overt DIC was the strongest predictor of mortality (OR = 144, 95 % CI: 18.66-1111.07). Similarly, patients with overt DIC exhibited markedly elevated aPC (P < 0.001). Among non-survivors, aPC was positively correlated with the 24-hour vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS; r = 0.567, P = 0.005). ROC analysis revealed that for predicting mortality, both aPC (AUC = 0.804, 95 % CI: 0.709-0.900) and the combined AT/aPC model (AUC = 0.814, 95 % CI: 0.714-0.913) significantly outperformed AT alone (AUC = 0.736, 95 % CI: 0.595-0.878).For predicting overt DIC, aPC (AUC = 0.859, 95 % CI: 0.778-0.939) and the combined model (AUC = 0.850, 95 % CI: 0.764-0.935) both demonstrated high accuracy. Notably, only the combined model effectively identified non-overt DIC (AUC = 0.850, 95 % CI: 0.768-0.932), whereas AT (AUC = 0.723) and aPC (AUC = 0.742) alone showed suboptimal performance. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this preliminary study identifies a combined AT/aPC model as a promising early predictor of DIC progression and mortality in pneumonia-sepsis. If validated in larger, multicentre cohorts, this simple two-biomarker approach provides a potential biomarker foundation for future studies investigating personalised anticoagulation strategies by identifying high-risk patients in the non-overt DIC stage."
41241685,The role of the HOTEL score in predicting prognosis in patients with sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.,2025,"Sepsis and septic shock represent significant health concerns in emergency departments due to their high mortality rates. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic predictive ability of the HOTEL score in patients diagnosed with sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department. This single-center, prospective, observational diagnostic evaluation study included a total of 151 patients who presented to the emergency department between August 1, 2023, and March 1, 2024, and were diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were recorded. The HOTEL score was calculated based on parameters including systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, body temperature, electrocardiographic changes, and loss of independence. Statistical analyses included receiver operating characteristic curves, logistic regression, and diagnostic test performance metrics. The median age of the included patients was 75 (interquartile range: 66.5-83.5) years. In terms of 30-day mortality, the HOTEL score (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.607) and SOFA score (AUC: 0.612) demonstrated similar predictive ability. Regarding the need for intubation in the emergency department, the HOTEL score (AUC: 0.773) and SOFA score (AUC: 0.835) were statistically significant. Multivariate analysis identified the HOTEL score, C-reactive protein levels, and the presence of active malignancy as independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Among the parameters of the HOTEL score, loss of independence emerged as the most significant predictor. According to the results of our study, the HOTEL score serves as an independent predictor of short-term mortality in patients with sepsis and septic shock. It may be a useful tool in predicting short-term mortality and the need for intubation in the emergency department for patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, it is recommended that the HOTEL score be used in combination with other clinical parameters rather than alone. In particular, clinical parameters such as loss of independence appear to contribute significantly to the predictive power of the score. Future studies should focus on modifying the HOTEL score and evaluating its utility in different patient populations and larger sample sizes."
41241295,Smoking and Surgical Complications Following Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A NSQIP Analysis.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: To compare post-operative complication rates after robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) between smokers and nonsmokers. METHODS: We reviewed all reports of RALP as the principal procedure in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2012-2022. We excluded patients with nonmale gender, disseminated cancer, preoperative sepsis, and ventilator dependency. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess associations between active smoking (smoking cigarettes in the year prior to surgery) and 30-day post-operative complications, adjusted for various confounders. RESULTS: We identified 96,410 reports of RALP, of which 10,581 (11.0%) were performed on smokers. In multivariate analysis, smoking was significantly associated with infectious complications, including superficial surgical site infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.43; 95% CI 1.08-1.85), UTI (aOR 1.39; 95% CI 1.10-1.73), and septic shock (aOR 1.76; 95% CI 1.01-2.91) within 30 days. Smokers were also found to have greater odds of surgical complications such as receipt of blood transfusion within 72 h (aOR 1.41; 95% CI 1.07-1.84), prolonged operation time >/=5hr (aOR 1.35; 95% CI 1.21-1.50), and prolonged postoperative stay >/=3d (aOR 1.47; 95% CI 1.32-1.63). Overall, smoking was associated with greater odds of any complication (aOR 1.39; 95% CI 1.28-1.50). CONCLUSION: Smoking was a significant risk factor for major 30-day infectious and surgical complications following RALP. While smoking cessation has been previously demonstrated to improve long-term oncologic outcomes after RALP, encouragement of smoking cessation before RALP may reduce immediate post-operative complications."
41241280,Campylobacter fetus meningitis and bacteremia: A case report in a post-liver transplant and post-splenectomy patient and a restructured literature review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Campylobacter fetus is a rare but serious pathogen, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. Central nervous system infections, particularly meningitis, are uncommon; only one case has been reported after liver transplantation and none after splenectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report meningitis and bacteremia caused by C. fetus subsp. fetus (Cff) in a 70-year-old man with liver transplantation and splenectomy for hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis, on long-term immunosuppression. He presented with intermittent fever; blood cultures grew C. fetus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures confirmed it. Therapy was changed from cefmetazole to meropenem and vancomycin, then de-escalated to high-dose ampicillin. After 23 days of antibiotics, he fully recovered without sequelae. LITERATURE REVIEW: The literature review included 36 adult cases identified through a PubMed search and our own case. Seventy-eight percent were male, with a median age of 49 years. Sixteen percent were immunocompromised, while 41 % were otherwise healthy. Exposure risks were reported in 43 %, though absent in 54 %. Of 38 isolates, 24 were subspeciated: Cff was most frequent (18/24, 75 %), followed by C. fetus subsp. intestinalis and venerealis (2 each), and single isolates of jejuni and Spirillum serpens. Relapse occurred in 22 %, and mortality was 5 %. CONCLUSION: C. fetus meningitis is rare and diagnostically challenging but should be considered in immunocompromised patients, including those with post-transplantation or post-splenectomy status. Infection may occur even without clear exposure. Both blood and CSF cultures are essential, with blood cultures often positive earlier. Prompt diagnosis and targeted therapy are crucial for favorable outcomes, and long-term follow-up is recommended due to relapse risk."
41241236,Cytomegalovirus reactivation and the host immune response in patients with sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare host response profiles between sepsis patients who develop cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (reactivators) and those who do not (non-reactivators). METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study in CMV-seropositive sepsis patients from two Dutch ICUs. Reactivators (plasma CMV >/=100 IU/ml) were matched 1:1 to non-reactivators, based on length of stay until reactivation, disease severity, and other relevant criteria. We analysed 32 plasma biomarkers and whole-blood gene expression on the day of CMV reactivation (or matched time point for non-reactivators), three days prior, and at ICU admission. RESULTS: We compared 81 reactivators with 81 matched non-reactivators. In reactivators, six soluble immune checkpoint regulators increased longitudinally from three days before to the day of CMV viraemia onset. In contrast, biomarkers reflecting cytokine release, endothelial activation, coagulation, inflammation and organ damage remained stable. Structural equation modelling identified inhibitory checkpoint regulation as the only variable independently associated with CMV reactivation. Gene expression analysis three days before reactivation revealed upregulation of innate immunity, haemostasis, and CMV-related pathways, alongside downregulation of adaptive immunity and cytokine signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: CMV reactivation in sepsis is preceded by broad immune dysregulation. These data provide insight into antiviral immune mechanisms that are impaired prior to reactivation and may inform preventive strategies."
41241100,Insights into chlamydial infection at the sub-cellular level using label-free Raman spectroscopy in comparison to electron microscopy.,2026,"Intracellular infections are difficult to study as the host cell protects the pathogen from direct observation from the outside. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most commonly used method for subcellular analysis. However, sample preparation is based on fixation which prevents continuous observation. Here, we focus on the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia abortus. It causes infections primarily in small ruminant livestock, and can also be transmitted to humans, where it can cause disease. Diagnosis is difficult, requiring PCR or cell culture. At the moment, non-invasive methods for the direct study of intracellular infections are rare and not yet established in routine analysis. In this study, we present 3D confocal Raman imaging as a non-invasive tool to investigate and characterize the infection directly inside intact host cells without the need for any purification step and compare the results to established conventional TEM. A 2D cell culture infection model with Buffalo Green Monkey kidney cells was employed and infection with Chlamydiaabortus S26/3 was characterized at different time points post infection. Using multivariate statistical data analysis, high-quality false color image stacks were generated from the Raman data. Two Chlamydia morphoforms, elementary body and reticulate body, could be distinguished based on their Raman spectral features: reticulate bodies are characterized by prominent lipid and nucleic acid signals while elementary bodies revealed higher carbohydrate and protein signals. This provides complementary information to TEM analysis where morphoforms are differentiated based on size and contrast. The complementary nature of both imaging methods is discussed in the manuscript."
41240501,Associations of coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers with clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to acute infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the associations of coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers with clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. METHODS: Subjects (n=105) were selected from septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction treated between January 2022 and December 2024. Detection of coagulation function indicators [platelets (PLT), fibrinogen (Fib), and D-dimer (D-D)] and intestinal function impairment markers [endotoxin (ET) and d-lactate (d-Lac)] was completed on the day of admission. Patients were divided into two groups based on their 28 day survival status (dead or alive): a group of patients that died and survival group. RESULTS: The APACHE II score, SOFA score, D-D and d-Lac were influencing factors of clinical outcomes (P<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of Fib, D-D, ET and d-Lac alone and their combination for predicting death were 67.44%, 74.42%, 81.40%, 65.17% and 77.74%, and 75.81%, 74.19%, 67.74%, 75.81% and 83.87%, respectively, and the areas under the curves were 0.737, 0.815, 0.779, 0.748 and 0.868, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers have associations with the clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction."
41240462,von Willebrand factor and fibrin monomer - induced septic shock coagulation typing: Clinical comparison between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - like syndrome and sepsis - induced coagulopathy with prognostic implications.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the pathological mechanisms, clinical features, and prognostic differences between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-like syndrome (TTP-like syndrome) and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) in patients experiencing septic shock. The findings will provide a basis for subtype-guided diagnosis and treatment of coagulation disorders. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort, 250 septic shock patients were divided into TTP-like syndrome (n = 101), SIC (n = 113), and control (n = 36) groups. Platelet count, vWF, FM, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and 28-day mortality were analyzed to compare coagulation phenotypes and outcomes. RESULTS: The TTP-like syndrome group was characterized by thrombocytopenia, with a median platelet (PLT) decline rate of 49.10 %. This group also exhibited markedly elevated vWF antigen levels, averaging 334.66 +/- 80.04 %. Additionally, all patients in this group presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at a rate of 100 %. In contrast, the SIC group demonstrated more severe platelet consumption, with a median PLT of 42 x 10(9)/L, elevated fibrinogen degradation product (FM) levels (median 9.22 mug/mL), and a significantly higher 28-day mortality rate (35.40 % vs. 11.88 % in the TTP-like group). The patterns of organ injury varied between the two groups; the SIC group displayed more pronounced liver (SOFA 1.43 +/- 1.08) and renal (SOFA 1.41 +/- 1.47) involvement, while the TTP-like syndrome group predominantly exhibited circulatory (SOFA 2.46 +/- 1.45) and respiratory (SOFA 2.53 +/- 0.76) dysfunction. vWF and FM had some predictive value for 28-day mortality, with area under the curve values of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. CONCLUSION: TTP-like syndrome and SIC represent heterogeneous coagulation phenotypes in septic shock, with differences in biomarkers, organ injury, and prognosis. A vWF- and FM-guided subtype classification may improve individualized treatment strategies and prognostic management."
41239429,Early mortality in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: In patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), early mortality, defined as death within 30 days following diagnosis, is the main driver of overall survival. Intensivists play a pivotal role in the management of patients with APL. METHOD: The PubMed and Embase databases were searched on December 1, 2023. All studies focusing on early mortality in patients with newly diagnosed APL were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and assessed bias using the risk-of-bias 2 scale for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for other types of studies. A meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed. The primary outcome was early mortality. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess the differences between interventional and observational studies. Secondary outcomes included reasons for early mortality and the occurrence of severe hemorrhage or differentiation syndrome (DS). RESULTS: Of the 950 studies screened, 140 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 54,923 patients newly diagnosed with APL were included in the meta-analysis. A meta-analytical early mortality rate of 12% was calculated across 122 studies. Early mortality was lower in interventional studies (8%) than in observational studies (15%). Hemorrhage was the main cause of early mortality (57%), followed by sepsis (18%), DS (12%), and thrombotic events (2%). In a meta-regression, early mortality was influenced by patients' age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, time, study type, and country of origin according to income classification. CONCLUSION: There is an encouraging decrease over time of early mortality in patients with APL. Early mortality is lower in interventional studies. This result reflects the difficulty of translating the successes of RCT and interventional research into real-world clinical practice. This study puts forward the need to improve and standardize early management, notably in the intensive care unit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study's protocol was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42023488480)."
41239342,Identification of protein biomarkers to differentiate between gram-negative and gram-positive infections in adults suspected of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is mostly caused by bacterial infections and requires a prompt diagnosis. There is a need for improved diagnostics by differentiating between gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. METHODS: The plasma levels of 285 unique proteins in patients with gram-negative infection (n = 154), gram-positive infection (n = 92), and in healthy controls (n = 35) were quantified using proximity extension assay. Three machine learning algorithms; random forest, recursive feature elimination, and adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were employed to identify discriminative proteins, with their effectiveness assessed using accuracy metrics. The selected proteins were further evaluated for their ability to differentiate between gram-negative and gram-positive infections through logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: We identified 55 discriminative proteins differentiating between gram-negative and gram-positive infections using the Lasso, the best performing algorithm. The discriminative proteins achieved AUROC values of 0.69 for gram-negative infections and 0.66 for gram-positive infections, both compared to the remaining groups, and 0.58 for differentiating between the two infection groups. Comparative statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in protein expression between gram-negative and gram-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 55 proteins with some discriminative potential between gram-negative and gram-positive infections. However, the overall predictive performance was low and did not exceed that of established single biomarkers. These findings highlight the challenges of applying a multimarker approach in infection classification and emphasize the need for further studies using larger and more diverse cohorts, as well as broader analytical methods, to explore their potential clinical utility. CLINICAL TRIAL: Not applicable. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-11973-5."
41239341,Predictors of low-level viremia in chronic hepatitis B and the efficacy of pegylated interferon-alpha: a real-world study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Low-level viremia (LLV) is closely associated with the prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), it can increase the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Our research aims to explore how to identify LLV early and implement effective therapeutic intervention. METHODS: This retrospective study included 720 patients who were either treatment-naive or had not received treatment within the past 5 years. After 48 weeks follow-up, they were categorized into either the complete virological response (CVR) or LLV. Independent risk factors associated with LLV were screened by LASSO regression analysis and a prediction model incorporating these factors was developed. Furthermore, among patients who developed LLV, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NAs) monotherapy and pegylated interferon alpha (IFNalpha)-based combination therapy. RESULTS: Firstly, four independent risk variables were found to be connected to the incidence of LLV, including age, baseline HBV DNA level, baseline HBsAg level, and baseline HBeAg status. The model showed AUCs of 0.861 (training) and 0.799 (validation), with good calibration. Secondly, between IFNalpha-based combination therapy and NAs monotherapy group, HBV DNA clearance rates showed no difference at week 24 but significant divergence at week 48 (p = 0.684 and p = 0.001). HBsAg decline rates (in patients with baseline HBsAg >/= 1500 IU/mL) differed significantly at both 24/48 weeks (p < 0.001). Throughout the 48-week follow-up, the cumulative rates of HBV DNA clearance (p < 0.001), HBsAg loss (p < 0.001), HBeAg loss (p = 0.008), and HBeAg seroconversion (p = 0.001) were all significantly higher in the combination therapy group, though the cumulative HBsAg seroconversion rate was not (p = 0.535). Furthermore, stratified analysis confirmed the superior efficacy of IFNalpha-based combination therapy across key subgroups. It outperformed NAs monotherapy both in patients with HBsAg >/= 1500 IU/mL (24w: p = 0.031; 48w: p = 0.002) and in those with HBV DNA < 500 IU/mL (24w: p = 0.01; 48w: p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Age, baseline HBV DNA level, HBsAg level, and HBeAg status were independently associated with the prevalence of LLV independently. Compared to NAs monotherapy, IFNalpha-based combination therapy in LLV patients demonstrated significantly higher rates of CVR, HBsAg decline, HBsAg loss/seroconversion, and HBeAg loss."
41239021,Predicting multiple organ failure after major orthopedic interventions is possible using only conventional laboratory tests.,2025,"PURPOSE: The decision to delay secondary, non-life-saving orthopedic surgery to reduce the risk of multiple organ failure (MOF) or sepsis is largely based on expert opinion. A decision-making tool may solve this problem by pre-operatively reflecting the patient's inflammatory/coagulation status. We aimed to determine whether the combination of readily available measures of inflammation and coagulation could predict MOF/sepsis in polytrauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-center study of adult trauma patients requiring pelvic/acetabular surgery. Patients were recruited from October 2011-January 2018. The primary outcome was postoperative MOF and sepsis. Full blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, complement C3 and C4, C-reactive protein, tryptase, cortisol, and interleukin-6 were collected preoperatively and 30 min, 1 day, and 3 days postoperatively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster the data within and across time. Logistic regression was used to predict MOF or sepsis using the top 4 principal components. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were recruited. The incidence of MOF and sepsis was 7% and 13%, respectively. PCA of preoperatively-collected immune and coagulation markers predicted MOF (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.94). Using routine tests alone predicted MOF with an AUC of 0.94. Sepsis was predictable with less accuracy than MOF from PCA (preoperative-AUC: 0.76). CONCLUSION: The routine clinical data available prior to non-life-saving definitive pelvic/acetabular surgery could predict MOF, and may serve as a tool for orthopedic surgeons to optimise the timing of surgery. Multi-centre, prospective investigation is required for validation."
41238749,Inflammatory markers predict bloodstream infections risk in hematological malignancy patients with chemotherapy induced neutropenia.,2025,"Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and febrile neutropenia (FN) significantly increase the risk of invasive infections, which can progress to septic shock or sepsis and may ultimately result in death. our purpose of this study is to construct a predictive model based on peripheral blood inflammatory markers to enable timely detection of bloodstream infections (BSI) and evaluation of infection severity in this population. A total of 112 patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) who developed BSI and 145 patients without BSI (NBSI) were included. Inflammatory marker levels were compared across subgroups. The Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for BSI within the training cohort. Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and diagnostic calibration curves. Patients with BSI had longer disease duration, a higher proportion of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and significantly lower levels of complete blood count and inflammatory markers compared to those without BSI. Univariate analysis identified prolonged disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, and reduced levels of NLR, MLR, PLR, SIRI, and SII as risk factors for BSI. A nomogram model was constructed incorporating disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, MLR, PLR, and SII. ROC and DCA indicated a broad threshold range for clinical applicability and a high net benefit of predictive model, supporting its clinical utility. Diagnostic calibration curves showed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test P-value of 0.3289. A nomogram model incorporating disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, MLR, PLR, and SII was constructed and shown to provide a practical and effective tool for the assessment and early identification of BSI in patients with CIN."
41238126,Unmasking metabolic endotoxemia: Proteinase K-enhanced detection of free and protein-associated endotoxin in human serum.,2026,"Metabolic endotoxemia is a low-grade endotoxin exposure that leaks from the gut into the bloodstream, contributing to low-grade chronic inflammation. The most used method to quantify endotoxins is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay; however, its accuracy is limited due to the strong affinity of endotoxins for plasma proteins like albumin and lipoproteins, which can mask them and interfere with detection by factor C. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of proteinase K pretreatment to unmask protein-bound endotoxins in human serum, allowing quantification of total, free, and bound fractions using the LAL assay. Participants were classified as normal-weight or obese based on anthropometric and biochemical criteria. Blood samples were obtained under fasting conditions and 180 min after a balanced meal. Each sample was split into two aliquots: one untreated and the other digested with proteinase K. Protein degradation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and a formula was applied to estimate the percentage of protein-bound endotoxin. Results showed an approximately fivefold increase in detectable endotoxin levels after proteolysis under fasting conditions in both groups, and a smaller, though significant, postprandial increase. Obese participants showed a lower postprandial percentage of protein-bound endotoxin than normal-weight individuals, despite similar endotoxin after proteolysis levels in both groups. These findings highlight the need for proteolysis in accurately measuring endotoxin concentrations. Furthermore, the proportion of protein-bound endotoxin may serve as a marker of physiological detoxification capacity. The study suggests that inflammation risk is more closely tied to endotoxin bioavailability than total circulating levels."
41237320,Nanosensor-Based Pattern-Generating Probe Accelerates Sepsis Diagnosis.,2025,"Biomimetic optical sensor arrays hold promising potential in differentiating nuances within intricate mixtures and biosamples. Nonetheless, developing a standalone pattern-generating sensor for multianalyte identification in clinical biofluids, without the necessity of complicated synthesis, presents significant challenges. Here, we introduce a nanosensor-inspired sensor array (NanoSA), composed of a nanoassembly incorporating three sensors, that exhibits multiple intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effects. This pattern-generating nanoassembly, featuring six channels, parallel sensing, and rapid response, identifies 24 septic bacteria within 30 s (96.9% accuracy). Meanwhile, the nanoassembly shows excellent results in discriminating between multiplex bacterial infections, varying concentrations of bacteria, and those in diverse biofluids (serum and urine). Optimized by nine machine learning algorithms, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model achieved a 97.6% test accuracy in differentiating clinical sepsis samples infected by five distinct bacteria within 30 s, highlighting the potential of the NanoSA as a crucial tool for the rapid clinical diagnosis."
41237264,A LASSO-based integrative model of serum biomarkers and gene polymorphisms for predicting poor sepsis prognosis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The integration of serum biomarkers and gene polymorphisms may enhance early prognostic assessment in sepsis. Early and accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving survival. However, the clinical utility of combining genetic markers with conventional inflammatory indicators remains insufficiently validated. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort (n = 81; July 2022-July 2024), patients were grouped by 28-day outcome. Candidate genes (TLR4, PPARgamma, IL-12B, IL-27) were shortlisted from GSE54514. After data standardization and complete-case handling of < 5% missingness, ten-fold cross-validated LASSO selected predictors for multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by ROC AUC, Hosmer - Lemeshow (H - L) test, calibration plots, bootstrap optimism-correction (1,000 resamples), and decision-curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: 6 predictors were retained - PCT, CRP, lactate (LAC), lactate clearance rate (LCR), TLR4 rs4986790, and PPARgamma rs1801282. The nomogram achieved AUC 0.885 (95% CI 0.812-0.943) with sensitivity 88.6% and specificity 73.9%; calibration was good (H - L chi(2) = 9.191, p = 0.156). Bootstrap-corrected AUC was 0.872, with calibration slope 0.97 and Brier score 0.165. DCA indicated higher net benefit than SOFA or APACHE II across 0.05-0.40 threshold probabilities. In benchmarking, the integrative model outperformed SOFA and APACHE II (DeltaAUC 0.129 and 0.104; DeLong p = 0.004 and 0.009) and showed higher net benefit on decision-curve analysis across 0.05-0.40 threshold probabilities. CONCLUSION: This integrative biomarker-genotype model demonstrated strong internal performance and potential clinical utility for individualized risk stratification in sepsis. The results support combining genetic susceptibility and inflammatory biomarkers for enhanced prognostic precision, although external and multi-ethnic validation remains warranted before widespread adoption."
41237155,Genetic correlation analysis between sepsis and hematological traits: Identifying shared genomic regions.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, dysregulated cascades of inflammatory response to infection, remains a critical clinical condition, leading to morbidity and mortality. Better understanding of the genetic basis underlying sepsis has the potential to better prevent and treat this potentially life-threatening condition. Recent studies have identified genetic variants for sepsis and accumulated evidence for the relevance of hematological traits. However, genetic correlation analysis, testing the hypothesis of shared genetic underpinning of sepsis and hematological traits, as well as identifying shared specific genetic regions, is lacking. METHOD: In this study, we systematically evaluated the extent and statistical significance of global genetic correlation between sepsis and a comprehensive battery of 29 hematological traits, as well as performed local genetic correlation analysis to pinpoint the shared genomic regions. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed significant global genetic correlation between sepsis and five red blood cell indices. Local genetic correlation analyses identified 6-21 genomic regions with lengths ranging from 1.4kb to 5.6Mb shared between sepsis and seven hematological traits. CONCLUSION: Our findings improve our general understanding of the shared genetics between sepsis and different categories of blood cell traits, and have the potential to advance personalized medicine for sepsis."
41236912,Diagnostic utility of procalcitonin for detecting bacteremia in persons who inject drugs.,2025,"AIM: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are prone to bloodstream infections, but diagnosis is often delayed. This study evaluated the utility of admission serum procalcitonin for early detection of bacteremia. METHODS: A total of 131 adult male PWID admitted with suspected sepsis were prospectively enrolled. RESULTS: Bacteremia was confirmed in 52 (39.7%) cases, primarily due to Staphylococcus aureus and S. haemolyticus. Infective endocarditis was the leading diagnosis among bacteremic patients. Procalcitonin levels >/=0.51 ng/mL demonstrated high sensitivity (88.5%) and negative predictive value (82.9%), but low specificity (36.7%), resulting in limited diagnostic utility (area under the curve [AUC] 0.613). C-reactive protein (AUC 0.680) and serum albumin (AUC 0.723) outperformed procalcitonin. In-hospital mortality was 35.1%. CONCLUSION: Admission procalcitonin has limited diagnostic value for detecting bacteremia in PWID."
41236648,"Comparing outcomes of ureteric stent versus nephrostomy tube in urosepsis: a population-based study in Ontario, Canada.",2025,"PURPOSE: Urolithiasis is a common cause of obstruction and sepsis requiring urgent urinary diversion via nephrostomy tubes (NT) or ureteric stents. This study compares all-cause mortality between patients treated with NT versus ureteric stents for urosepsis secondary to urolithiasis, both during hospitalization and within 90 days post-discharge. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between April 2010 and December 2022, with an admitting diagnosis of urosepsis secondary to obstructive urolithiasis. Exclusion criteria included sepsis without concurrent urolithiasis, prior dialysis, end-stage renal disease, transplant, cystectomy, or genitourinary cancers. We used generalized linear and Cox regression models to compare all-cause mortality between NT and ureteric stent groups, applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to reduce selection bias. Our 90-day analysis also assessed the impact of definitive management following hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 4,573 patients, 620 underwent NT placement, and 3,953 received a ureteric stent. After adjusting for confounders, NT placement was associated with a 2.84-fold higher in-hospital mortality risk (RR: 2.84 [1.98, 3.92]) and a 1.52-fold higher 90-day mortality risk (HR: 1.52 [1.01, 2.30]). Furthermore, definitive management significantly reduced 90-day mortality risk by 62% (HR: 0.38 [0.23, 0.63]). CONCLUSION: While both interventions aim to relieve obstruction and facilitate resolution of infection, NT placement is linked to higher in-hospital and 90-day mortality. These findings highlight the importance of treatment selection in optimizing patient outcomes."
41236638,Early allogeneic stem cell transplantation after melphalan-induced aplasia leads to long-term survival in patients with primary refractory AML.,2025,"The prognosis of patients with AML, who fail to achieve complete remission after induction therapy (= primary refractory disease) has been dismal for many years. Allo-HSCT is the only curative approach and standard of care for eligible patients in this group. The need for inducing a remission before transplantation in primary refractory patients has not been finally clarified. The objective of this retrospective single-center evaluation is to analyze the outcomes of primary refractory patients who underwent immediate allogeneic HSCT after chemotherapy induced aplasia in the context of the conditioning regimen in a real-life setting. We started a program of immediate transplantation policy for eligible patients with refractory AML after induction chemotherapy in our center in 2010. All patients with a diagnosis of primary refractory AML who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in active disease between 03/2010 and 07/2023 at the department of Hematology at Klinikum Nuremberg, Germany, were included and analyzed. 50 patients were included in this analysis. Mean time from start of induction treatment to transplantation was 3 months (range 1.4-7.8 months). Melphalan (100-140 mg/m(2)) for induction of aplasia was used in 45/50 pts (90%) prior to conditioning. After a median follow-up of 9.97 (range: 0.03-143.8) months 18/50 (36%) patients were alive without relapse. Median and mean relapse free survival were 9.97 (range: 0.03-143.8) and 28.13 (range: 0.03-143.8) months respectively. The median and mean OS were 9.97 (range: 0.03-143.8) and 28.64 (range: 0.03-143.8) months. The 100-day, 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 66%, 48% and 42% respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2-years after transplantation was 18.5% (95% C.I., 10.3% - 33.1%) with a median time from HSCT to relapse of 4.85 (Range: 0.67-18,3) months. Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 100 days, 1- year and 2-years was 26% (95% C.I., 16.3% - 41.5%), 36.3% (C.I., 25.1% - 52.5%) and 38.4% (95% C.I., 26.9% - 54.7%) respectively. Main cause of overall mortality was TRM (58.1%) with Sepsis (41.9%) being the biggest single contributor. The only significant independent factor associated with decreased overall and 100-day survival was a positive patient CMV-status (independent of donor CMV-serostatus). The observed survival-rates in our study compare favorably to those published for established salvage-therapy regimens as well as other retrospective studies analyzing HSCT in active disease. We demonstrate that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in active disease is a reasonable approach for patients with primary refractory AML offering the chance for long-term survival for about one third of patients. The effect is compromised by the high incidence of non-relapse mortality."
41236566,ESICM guidelines on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring 2025.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: These European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guidelines provide recommendations for the diagnosis of shock and hemodynamic monitoring for adult critically ill patients. METHODS: An international panel of experts formulated PICO-formatted questions, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations. In the absence of strong evidence, panelists issued ungraded good practice statements (UGPS). RESULTS: Panelists issued 50 statements. Among others, skin perfusion should be monitored using the assessment of capillary refill time, and this may be complemented by the assessment of skin temperature and mottling (UGPS). In patients with a central venous catheter, serial measurements of (central) venous oxygen saturation and of the veno-arterial difference in carbon dioxide partial pressure should be performed (UGPS). In patients with persistent shock after initial fluid resuscitation, fluid responsiveness should be assessed before continuing fluid resuscitation (UGPS). It is recommended to use dynamic variables over static markers of preload for predicting fluid responsiveness, when applicable (graded statement). Cardiac output (CO) and/or stroke volume should be monitored in patients who do not respond to initial therapy (UGPS). Arterial pressure should be monitored with an arterial catheter in shock that is not responsive to initial therapy and/or requiring vasopressor infusion (UGPS), and central venous pressure should be measured in patients who have a central venous catheter (UGPS). Panelists suggest using echocardiography as the first-line imaging modality to assess the type of shock (graded statement). Echocardiographically defined phenotypes of left and right ventricular dysfunction may be of prognostic significance (UGPS). CONCLUSIONS: The panel made 50 recommendations on shock diagnosis and hemodynamic monitoring."
41236198,Association between estimated plasma volume status and risk of sepsis-associated acute kidney Injury: a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"Estimated plasma volume status (ePVS) is a simple, useful tool for assessing volume status. However, its prognostic value in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 15,789 patients with SA-AKI extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. The association between ePVS and mortality was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between ePVS and renal recovery. All models were adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and illness severity scores. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was applied to examine potential nonlinear relationships between ePVS and mortality risk. Among 15,789 eligible patients with SA-AKI, the 28-day mortality rate was 23.2%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that higher ePVS was associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, p < 0.001) and logistic regression analysis further indicated that elevated ePVS was correlated with reduced renal recovery (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99, p = 0.002). RCS demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between ePVS and mortality, with an inflection point identified at 5.47 dL/g. Using this cutoff, the high-ePVS group exhibited significantly higher 28-, 60-, and 180-day mortality and lower renal recovery than the low-ePVS group. ePVS is an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in SA-AKI, showing a U-shaped association. These findings suggest ePVS may serve as a useful prognostic marker to guide fluid management strategies in SA-AKI."
41236176,Real-World Investigation of Satralizumab in Patients With Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disease.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Satralizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, its real-world effectiveness and safety compared to conventional immunosuppressive therapies remain uncertain. METHODS: We identified patients diagnosed with NMOSD in the TriNetX federated health research platform between January 2018 and April 2024. This international platform was accessed via Taipei Medical University. Patients were followed for 1 month to 3 years. A 1:1 propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis balanced baseline characteristics between the satralizumab and conventional immunosuppressant groups. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for relapse risk and safety outcomes, including sepsis, respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, anemia, neutropenia, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 220 patients received satralizumab, while 1744 received conventional immunosuppressants. After PSM, 218 patients remained in each group. Satralizumab was associated with a significantly lower relapse risk at 1 month (RR: 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.66), 3 months (RR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.28-0.66), 6 months (RR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.70), 9 months (RR: 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.83), 12 months (RR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.83), 24 months (RR: 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.86) and 36 months (RR: 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.83). Across all follow-up intervals, numbers needed to treat were consistently between 4 and 9. No significant differences were observed in infection rates, anemia, neutropenia, or mortality between the groups. INTERPRETATION: Satralizumab demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing NMOSD relapse rates compared to conventional immunosuppressants while maintaining a comparable safety profile."
41235945,Comparison of VITEK REVEAL fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing to antibiotic disk diffusion for gram-negative bloodstream infections.,2025,"The VITEK REVEAL antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) system is a fast in vitro diagnostic device that determines the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of gram-negative organisms from positive blood culture after independent organism identification. The objectives of this study were to (i) compare the performance of VITEK REVEAL to disk diffusion (DD) and (ii) evaluate implementation of VITEK REVEAL into a laboratory workflow that employs matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as the primary method for organism identification. A total of 150 monomicrobial, GN-positive blood cultures were enrolled, of which 47.3% (71/150) contained Escherichia coli, 17.3% (26/150) Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 15.3% (23/150) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with the remaining comprising other Enterobacterales and one Acinetobacter spp. The time to result (TTR) from blood culture positivity to AST results was compared for DD with tiered testing for multidrug-resistant organisms and VITEK REVEAL. Overall, the standard-of-care workflow had a combined TTR for AST of 37.2-54.7 h, while the workflow of MALDI-TOF MS + VITEK REVEAL had a TTR of 14.0 h due to the time necessary to identify the organism using MALDI-TOF MS. The categorical agreement (CA) for claimed organism-antibiotic combinations was 97.0%, with a very major discrepancy (VMD) of 2.9% (8/279) and a major discrepancy (MD) of 0.3% (5/1957), following adjudication of discrepant results with broth microdilution. The CA for organisms with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype (n = 29) was 93.2%, with VMD of 2.0%, and MD of 0.7%. In conclusion, the VITEK REVEAL reduced the TTR for AST by at least 23 h compared to standard-of-care DD, with a CA of 97%.IMPORTANCEBloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacteria require effective and timely treatment. Laboratory testing informs the choice of antibiotics, but traditional methods can require multiple days for results. The VITEK REVEAL system determines antibiotic susceptibility directly from a positive blood culture within 8 h, though it requires an independent method for organism identification, such as mass spectrometry or nucleic acid amplification testing. In this study, we examined VITEK REVEAL as part of a workflow incorporating mass spectrometry for organism identification. This combined approach provided susceptibility results approximately 1 day earlier than standard disk diffusion while maintaining high accuracy for most organism-antibiotic combinations, including those active against multidrug-resistant organisms. Incorporating VITEK REVEAL into routine laboratory workflows has the potential to accelerate targeted therapy and limit unnecessary broad-spectrum use in patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections."
41235926,Perinatal and maternal outcomes of extremely early-onset fetal growth restriction (</= 26 weeks): systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To report the perinatal and maternal outcomes of singleton pregnancies complicated by extremely early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR), defined as FGR diagnosed </= 26 weeks of gestation. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for studies reporting the outcome of singleton pregnancies complicated by FGR diagnosed </= 26 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was perinatal death (PND), defined as the sum of intrauterine death (IUD) and neonatal death (NND). Secondary outcomes included genetic anomaly, structural anomaly, infection, pre-eclampsia (PE), IUD, NND, termination of pregnancy, preterm birth (PTB) </= 32 and </= 28 weeks of gestation, Cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, abnormal brain imaging, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal sepsis, neurological morbidity, composite adverse perinatal outcome (CAPO) and intact survival. All outcomes were explored in the overall population of pregnancies complicated by extremely early-onset FGR. A subset of outcomes was explored in a subgroup analysis of FGR etiology: apparently isolated FGR, FGR defined according to the Delphi criteria, or FGR due to genetic or structural anomaly. Among those with apparently isolated FGR, subgroup analyses were conducted according to the gestational-age cut-off used to define extremely early onset, gestational age at diagnosis, gestational age at birth and presence of abnormal Doppler findings. Random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was used to combine the data. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (2818 pregnancies) were included in the systematic review, of which 13 (2573 pregnancies) were included in the meta-analysis. Among all fetuses with extremely early-onset FGR, PND, IUD and NND occurred in 16.0% (95% CI, 8.1-26.0%), 8.8% (95% CI, 4.0-15.2%) and 6.2% (95% CI, 3.0-10.4%) of cases, respectively. PTB </= 32 and </= 28 weeks of gestation complicated 54.6% (95% CI, 23.1-84.2%) and 23.3% (95% CI, 4.7-50.3%) of pregnancies, respectively, while 45.6% (95% CI, 32.6-58.9%) underwent Cesarean delivery. CAPO affected 30.5% (95% CI, 19.4-42.8%) of infants, while neurological morbidity was reported in 38.3% (95% CI, 9.8-72.1%). Among pregnancies complicated by apparently isolated extremely early-onset FGR, PND occurred in 14.3% (95% CI, 6.2-25.0%) of cases. PTB </= 32 and </= 28 weeks of gestation occurred in 54.8% (95% CI, 49.8-59.7%) and 23.6% (95% CI, 4.9-50.6%) of cases, respectively. CAPO occurred in 28.8% (95% CI, 20.4-38.0%) of infants, while neurological morbidity was present in 38.3% (95% CI, 9.8-72.1%). In pregnancies complicated by extremely early-onset FGR due to a genetic or structural anomaly, PND occurred in 17.6% (95% CI, 6.2-33.3%) and CAPO in 19.3% (95% CI, 7.6-34.9%). CONCLUSION: Pregnancies with extremely early-onset FGR are at high risk of genetic and structural anomalies, as well as adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

41235763,"Venetoclax plus decitabine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, and G-CSF in adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: A multicenter, retrospective study.",2025,"This multicenter, retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the venetoclax plus decitabine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (VD-CAG) regimen in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (ND-AML) patients aged 18-60. The analysis included, but was not limited to, the composite complete response (CRc) rate, measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. A total of 107 adult patients with AML were included in the study, conducted between March 1, 2022, and December 31, 2024. The median age was 49 years (range: 18-60 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 44:63. The CRc rate after one cycle of the VD-CAG regimen was 86.9% (95% CI 79-92.7; 93 of 107 patients) in the entire cohort. 73 (79%) of 93 patients who reached CRc had undetectable MRD. Grade 3 or worse adverse events included neutropenia in 107 (100%) of 107 patients, thrombocytopenia in 107 (100%), anemia in 107 (100%), febrile neutropenia in 57 (53%), pneumonia in 10 (9.3%), sepsis in five (4.7%), and tumor lysis syndrome in three (2.8%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. With a median follow-up of 8.8 months (range: 1-33.5 months), the median EFS and OS are not reached. The estimated 12-month OS was 90% (95% CI 90-95) and 12-month EFS was 79% (95% CI 69-87). The VD-CAG regimen represents an effective induction therapy for young ND-AML. It leads to high rates of CRc and MRD-negative remissions, along with encouraging OS and EFS across prognostic subgroups."

Initially identified in the murine gut microbiota, it has recently been identified in the human gut microbiota. This article presents the case of an immunocompetent patient who was hospitalized with symptoms of sepsis. E. muris bacteraemia was diagnosed. This species was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing after comparison with published sequences. However, further studies are necessary to assess the impact of E. muris on the infection and to investigate potential clinical factors influencing these infections."
41235290,Empyema as an Unusual Presentation of Lung Cancer.,2025,"Malignant empyema is a rare presentation of lung cancer, marked by the accumulation of frank pus in the pleural space. It can result from various mechanisms, including direct tumor invasion, airway obstruction, immunosuppression, and secondary infections. The clinical presentation is often complex, with symptoms overlapping those of the underlying malignancy and potential complications like sepsis. In the present case, the patient initially presented with chest infection symptoms but, on further investigations, was diagnosed with lung malignancy. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach focused on draining the infected fluid, managing infection with antibiotics, and addressing the underlying cancer. Overall, the prognosis of malignant empyema is poor and often fatal."
41235288,Evaluating Compliance and Impact of the Sepsis Six Bundle in the Emergency Department: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"Background and objectives Sepsis resuscitation bundles are the subject of numerous quality improvement initiatives that have recently been implemented globally. These educational initiatives have been shown to be associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the compliance and impact of the Sepsis Six bundle in the emergency department (ED). Methodology A cohort study was conducted among 660 patients who had been diagnosed with sepsis in the ED of a tertiary care center. Results The mean age of study participants was 44.8+/-11.7 years. Of the total, 37% of the patients were female and 63% were male. Among the study participants, 286 (43.3%) patients had the presence of shock; 220 (33.3%) had the presence of sepsis at the time of admission, and 440 (66.7%) had the presence of sepsis after 24 hours of admission. The primary site of infection in the majority of study participants was the lung, followed by the brain, haematological origin, and the kidney. A mortality rate of 32% was noted. Conclusion Targeted quality improvement measures, staff training, and streamlined ED workflows are warranted to enhance adherence to the Sepsis Six bundle and ultimately improve survival rates in septic patients."
41234970,Platelet Count of Zero: A Case of Vancomycin-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia.,2025,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired hematologic disorder marked by immune-mediated destruction of platelets, leading to profound thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding risk. Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP), specifically vancomycin-induced immune thrombocytopenia (VIIT), is a rare but serious adverse drug reaction, caused by drug-dependent antibodies that accelerate platelet clearance. We present a case of a 72-year-old male who developed life-threatening thrombocytopenia, with a nadir of <1 K/microL, following re-exposure to vancomycin. The decline began within three days of treatment reinitiation and persisted despite platelet transfusions, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). A diagnosis of VIIT was made after excluding other etiologies, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), thrombotic microangiopathy, and sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts remained refractory until plasmapheresis and drug discontinuation, with recovery to 71 K/microL within one week. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of VIIT and suggests a potential role for plasmapheresis in refractory cases. Prompt drug discontinuation is critical for recovery."
41234904,Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in critically ill adults: a single-centre retrospective ICU cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by uncontrolled immune activation and multi-organ dysfunction. Whilst initially described in paediatric populations, HLH is increasingly recognised in critically ill adults, often triggered by malignancies, infections, or autoimmune diseases. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study analysed 43 adult patients with HLH admitted to the ICU between 2008 and 2024. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, organ support requirements, and outcomes were assessed. Temporal trends in routine parameters surrounding HLH diagnosis were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age was 45 years (IQR: 33-60), and 65% were male. Respiratory failure (62.8%) and sepsis (41.9%) were the leading causes of ICU admission. Disease severity was high, with a median SOFA score of 14 (IQR: 11-17), and ICU mortality reached 65.1%. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 83.7% of patients, and continuous renal replacement therapy in 72.1%. Ferritin levels were markedly elevated, with a median peak of 25,045 mug/l (IQR: 12,771-94,586), with 93% of patients exceeding 6,000 mug/l. The median HScore was 245 (IQR: 210-273) and did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.64). CONCLUSION: HLH in adult ICUs carries high mortality and demands extensive organ support. Existing diagnostic scores provide limited bedside guidance, highlighting the need for ICU-specific validation and improved prognostic markers."
41234615,Wearable vital-sign sensors for early detection of severe dengue and sepsis: Clinical applications and implementation in resource-limited settings.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Severe dengue and sepsis account for tens of millions of cases and deaths annually in low-resource settings, where spot-check vital sign monitoring misses early physiological deterioration. Affordable wearable sensors that stream continuous data and feed machine learning algorithms promise earlier detection and improved outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a structured narrative literature review of human studies on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar that evaluated wearable vital-sign devices for predicting severe dengue or sepsis in resource-limited areas. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted, and synthesized data on study design, devices, vital streams, predictive performance, and implementation barriers. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies (2019-2024) from Vietnam, Rwanda, Bangladesh, and South Korea tested photoplethysmography or single-lead electrocardiography wearables in intensive care units and emergency departments of hospitals. The algorithms achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83-0.86 for forecasting dengue shock up to 2 hours and sepsis deterioration up to 5-48 hours before conventional recognition. The precision reached 0.79 for the three-level dengue severity classification. Continuous monitoring reduces the time to intervention and matches or exceeds the accuracy of manual charting. CONCLUSION: Early evidence shows that low-cost wearable sensors can deliver clinically meaningful lead times for severe dengue and sepsis in developing countries' hospitals. However, generalizability, artifact suppression, power autonomy, and economic sustainability remain unproven. Multicentre pragmatic trials, edge-optimized algorithms, and full cost-effectiveness analyses are needed before routine adoption."
41234516,Personalized machine learning-based prognostic model for ICU-acquired bloodstream infections.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections (ICU-BSIs) are among the most prevalent healthcare-associated infections and a major cause of mortality among ICU patients. We developed a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict the prognosis of ICU-BSIs. METHODS: Adult patients with blood cultures drawn >/=48 hours after ICU admission were included: the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (AMU, China) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, USA). The AMU dataset was used for model training and internal validation, and the MIMIC-IV dataset served as the external validation set. The model incorporated routinely collected, easily obtainable clinical variables, including several representing the average rate of change in laboratory indicators. After comparing multiple algorithms, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was selected and optimized using cross-validation and grid search. RESULTS: A total of 1,903 patients from AMU and 3,496 from MIMIC-IV were included. In both cohorts, antibiotic duration, platelet count, serum creatinine, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were significantly associated with 28-day mortality (P < 0.001). The XGBoost model using 33 variables showed strong discrimination, with an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94) for training and 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.90) for internal validation. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified the 10 most important variables; a simplified model using these maintained good accuracy, with AUROC values of 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.85) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.70-0.73) for the internal and external validation sets, respectively. In pathogen subgroups, the internal AUROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.93) for Gram-positive (Gram+) and Gram-negative (Gram-) infections, with external validation AUROCs of 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.77) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.62-0.82), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a personalized ML-based prognostic model for ICU-BSIs using multicenter time-series data. This model may facilitate early identification of high-risk patients, enabling timely intervention and optimized ICU resource allocation."
41234146,"The last dance of coupled plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA): Clinical outcomes, challenges, and perspectives in multiple organ support therapy.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Coupled plasma filtration and adsorption (CPFA) is a non-selective extracorporeal technique designed to modulate systemic inflammation through plasma filtration combined with resin-based adsorption. While preclinical data were promising, randomized trials in septic shock yielded conflicting results and raised safety concerns, leading to its discontinuation. Nonetheless, selected patients might benefit from CPFA when adequately delivered. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center observational study of 36 critically ill patients treated with CPFA between 2019 and 2022. A total of 56 CPFA sessions were analyzed, evaluating clinical indications, plasma-treated volume (VPT), hemodynamic changes, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The main indication was sepsis (75%), followed by rhabdomyolysis and intoxications (8% each). Most patients received one to two sessions, with a mean duration of 9 +/- 1 h and a VPT of 10,103 +/- 4275 mL. Survival at 72 h and 28 days was 85% and 61%, respectively, with no early deaths. Patients achieving a VPT ⩾18% of estimated plasma volume had better 28-day survival (81% vs 42%, p = 0.03), although they had lower initial severity scores. A non-significant trend toward vasopressor reduction was observed. No major adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, CPFA was feasible and safe, with possible hemodynamic and survival benefits when a sufficient plasma-treated volume was reached. Patient selection and optimized treatment delivery appear crucial. However, the retrospective design and lack of a control group limit definitive conclusions. Future research should focus on more effective and targeted extracorporeal strategies for immune modulation in critically ill patients."
41233715,Mortality and reproducibility of calcium measurements in patients with hypercalcemia reporting to the emergency department of a tertiary German hospital.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe hypercalcemia often results in the referral of patients to the emergency department (ED), as life-threatening consequences are feared. However, the available literature concerning the causes of hypercalcemia, mortality and therapeutic responses in these patients is scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 1310 patients with a total serum calcium concentration >/= 2.65 mmol/l, who reported to the ED of the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, between January 1st, 2010, and March 31st, 2021, for any reason, investigating hypercalcemia-associated diagnoses, ECG changes, symptoms of hypercalcemia, the course of calcium values over the first 5 days and hospital mortality. RESULTS: The most common causes of hypercalcemia were malignancies, primary hyperparathyroidism and dehydration. Patients with sarcoidosis and vitamin D intoxication had the highest mean calcium levels at presentation. In patients with mild hypercalcemia, elevated total calcium values were often not reproducible in consecutive samples. Hypercalcemia due to dehydration, sepsis and subsequent to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) resulted in lower mean calcium levels, which quickly normalized in the following days. Hypercalcemia was well controlled with the applied therapies, even in the majority of patients who died during their hospital stay. We found no major abnormalities in the ECG analysis, and no death due to cardiac arrhythmias was documented in the patient charts. The mortality rate of patients varied greatly depending on the cause of hypercalcemia. Patients with malignancies had high mortality irrespective of total calcium levels at admission, whereas patients with sarcoidosis and hyperparathyroidism had low mortality despite high calcium levels. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for acute death due to hypercalcemia. The degree of hypercalcemia might not be the main factor influencing mortality in these patients. Given that mild hypercalcemia is often not reproducible in consecutive blood samples, persistent hypercalcemia should be confirmed before further work-up is initiated.

41233414,Machine learning prediction of mortality in pediatric fungemia using the Candida score.,2025,"Pediatric fungemia in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) carries high mortality. We evaluated whether the Candida Score, combined with clinical variables, predicts mortality after diagnosis using a prespecified multivariable logistic regression (primary model) and benchmarked discrimination against Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine. We analyzed 85 pediatric fungemia cases from a PICU (2016-2020). The prespecified primary model was multivariable logistic regression with predefined covariates; Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine were exploratory comparators. Discrimination was evaluated on a held-out test set and by 10-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping. In 85 cases, the median age was 6 months and median weight 4.8 kg; 62.4% were male. Candida albicans was the most prevalent species (37.6%). Of the subjects, 39 (45.9%) died and 46 (54.1%) survived. On the held-out test set (n = 17), logistic regression achieved accuracy 0.735 and AUC 0.800. Random Forest achieved AUC 0.861 (precision 1.000; recall 0.778), and Gradient Boosting achieved AUC 0.847 (precision 0.875; recall 0.778). Internal validation (10-fold cross-validation and bootstrap resampling) supported model stability.Conclusion Integrating the Candida Score with clinical predictors shows potential for mortality risk stratification after fungemia diagnosis. In this single-center cohort, Random Forest yielded the highest discrimination on the test set. Findings are exploratory and require external validation in larger, multicenter studies before clinical use."
41233130,[Impact of different blood transfusion thresholds on clinical outcomes in children with severe traumatic brain injury].,2025,"Objective: To explore the impact of different blood transfusion thresholds on clinical outcomes in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Clinical data was collected from 64 children with severe TBI who received red blood cell transfusions and were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Beijing Children's Hospital between January 2020 and December 2024. Data included basic clinical characteristics, mortality rate, neurological recovery (measured by Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at discharge, pediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) score), length of stay in the PICU, duration of mechanical ventilation, and incidence of complications. Patients were divided into a liberal transfusion group (hemoglobin >70-<100 g/L at first transfusion) and a restrictive transfusion group (hemoglobin </=70 g/L at first transfusion). Stratified analysis was performed based on age (children >5 and children </=5 years old). Comparisons between groups were conducted using the independent samples t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the 64 children with severe TBI (43 males and 21 females), the age was 4.9 (2.3, 10.0) years. There were 33 cases in the liberal transfusion group and 31 cases in the restrictive transfusion group. No statistically significant differences were observed in baseline data, including gender, age, trauma mechanism, GCS at admission, surgical intervention, presence of multiple injuries, or comorbidities (sepsis, shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute kidney injury) between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the liberal and restrictive transfusion groups in mortality rate, GCS and PCPC score at discharge, length of PICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or transfusion volume (all P>0.05). In the stratified analysis, 38 children aged over 5 years were included. The restrictive transfusion subgroup, which included 19 children, had a significantly longer PICU length of stay compared to the liberal transfusion subgroup, which also included 19 children (29.5 (18.0, 36.3) vs. 17.0 (6.3, 25.8) d,Z=2.11, P=0.035). Conclusions: There were no significant differences in PICU mortality or neurological functional recovery between the liberal and restrictive blood transfusion strategies in children with severe TBI. However, among children aged over than 5 years, a restrictive transfusion strategy might be associated with a longer length of PICU stay."

41232290,Obstructive pyelonephritis in intensive care units: A retrospective multicenter study.,2026,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate mortality and prognostic factors of patients admitted to ICU for obstructive pyelonephritis. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study. All patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU, N = 8) for obstructive pyelonephritis were included. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 483 patients were included over a 10-year period. Disease was severe at admission with frequent organ support therapy including norepinephrine infusion (70 %) and invasive mechanical ventilation (23 %). The most frequent causes of obstruction were kidney stones, cancer, and ureteral stent obstruction. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen identified in urine (63 %), and two-thirds of patients had positive blood cultures. Infection with Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was observed in 53 (11 %) patients. Urinary drainage was performed either before ICU admission (43 %), < 6 h (28 %), or > 6 h (29 %), mainly using double-J stenting (71 %). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were the need for vasopressors (OR: 3.27 [95 % CI 1.33-8.06], p = 0.01), mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.49 [95 % CI 1.35-4.59, p = 0.004]), lactate levels (per 1 mmol/l increase) (OR: 1.18 [95 % CI 1.06-1.31, p = 0.004]), tumor-related obstruction (OR: 4.78 [95 % CI 2.24-10.17], p < 0.001), and stent obstruction (OR: 3.38 [95 % CI 1.44-7.93, p = 0.005]). Delayed urinary drainage (>12 h) was associated with mortality only in patients receiving vasopressors. CONCLUSION: Obstructive pyelonephritis is a severe condition leading to organ failure and significant in-hospital mortality. Urinary drainage should be performed as soon as possible, especially in patients with septic shock."
41232225,Fatal septicemia caused by human-associated NDM-5-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST323 clone in a dog.,2026,"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), particularly those harboring New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), represent a growing global health threat due to their resistance to carbapenems and other beta-lactam antimicrobials. While the presence of NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae is well-documented in human healthcare settings, its emergence in companion animals remains a critical concern. This study reports the identification and genomic characterization of an NDM-5-producing K. pneumoniae strain (ICBKPJB) isolated from an infected dog in Brazil. Strain ICBKPJB exhibited a multidrug resistance profile, including to carbapenems, and carried multiple antimicrobial resistance genes, highlighting bla(NDM-5) and bla(CTX-M-15). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that ICBKPJB belongs to the human healthcare-associated clone of the sequence type (ST) 323, whereas phylogenomic analysis grouped the ICBKPJB strain with human and environmental ST323 strains (SNP counts ranging from 95 to 147). The presence of an IncX3 plasmid harboring the bla(NDM-5) gene was confirmed, whereas in silico plasmid analysis demonstrated that it was closely related to plasmids found in K. pneumoniae strains from both humans and animals worldwide. These findings underscore the risk of interspecies transmission of CPE and emphasize the need to strengthen alliances between human and veterinary medicine to address the emergence, spread, and circulation of carbapenem resistance across both sectors."
41232115,Neonatal tropical infections: A case series and clinical insights.,2026,"Tropical fevers can occur year-round but are rare in neonates. These infections, caused by bacteria and viruses, include Dengue, Malaria, Typhoid, Yellow Fever, Zika, Chikungunya, Leptospirosis, Scrub Typhus and Influenza. This case series presents five neonatal tropical infections admitted to our NICU: two congenital Chikungunya, two neonatal Chikungunya and one co-infection of Dengue and Zika. The diagnosis was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction serology. In two cases, both mother and newborn tested positive; in three, only the newborn was positive. Neonatal tropical infections are rare and often mimic sepsis with symptoms such as skin manifestations, seizures and encephalopathy, making diagnosis challenging."
41231552,Dual-mode electrochemical-colorimetric immunosensor based on an integrated FeOOH-Au-MB probe for sensitive procalcitonin detection.,2025,"The integration of a dual-mode detection mechanism into immunosensing analysis technology can significantly enhance detection accuracy. However, the construction process is complex due to the differences in analysis principles, posing substantial technical challenges in the coordinated adaptation of multiple principles. We developed a novel dual-mode immunosensor based on ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) microboxes modified with gold nanoparticles and loaded with methylene blue into a multifunctional FeOOH-Au-MB probe which does not require any additional reagents. In the electrochemical detection mode, the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of the FeOOH microboxes prepared at room temperature can efficiently bind to the electron mediator methylene blue, achieving significant amplification of the electrochemical signal. In the colorimetric detection mode, the Fe(3+) ions released from the FeOOH microboxes react with ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](4-)) to form Prussian blue, resulting in a visible color change. The dual-mode self-calibration function can enhance the reliability and sensitivity of detection. Under optimal detection conditions, it exhibits a wide detection range from 1.0 pg mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1) for the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin (PCT), with detection limits of 0.28 pg mL(-1) (electrochemical mode) and 0.42 pg mL(-1) (colorimetric mode). The dual-mode immunosensor based on FeOOH-Au-MB could be used for clinical diagnosis, providing a potential tool for medical professionals."
41231286,Real-world clinical outcomes of CAR-T therapy from the Montefiore health system in the Bronx.,2025,"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment, but data in diverse urban populations remain limited. We report outcomes from a comprehensive cancer center in the Bronx. Montefiore Health System treated 79 DLBCL patients with CAR-T from March 2018 to July 2024. Demographics, comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and acute complications, including immune effector cell neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), cardiotoxicity, and pulmonary events, were tabulated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed up to five years. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were calculated for remission and 3-year mortality. CAR-T achieved complete remissions in 50.6%, partial remission in 16.5%, and progression in 22.8%. Cumulative mortality was 10.1% during treatment and 34.2% by five years. Complete remission reduced 3-year mortality (aHR 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.43). Complications included CRS (76.0%), ICANS (49.4%), neutropenic fever (58.2%), and sepsis (19.0%). ICANS correlated with CRS, ICU stay, and sepsis. Socioeconomic status was not linked to mortality, but comorbidities increased risk. CAR-T complete remission is an independent predictor of reduced mortality. High rates of complications, particularly CRS and ICAN, reinforce the need for vigilant monitoring and management strategies to enhance long-term outcomes."
41230996,CanID-PCR: a quick and low-cost PCR tool to identify Candida species on gDNA directly extracted from positive blood bottles.,2026,"Candida bloodstream infection carries high mortality, and antifungal-resistant species, such as Candida auris and C. glabrata, are increasingly common. Delays in species identification can adversely affect patient outcomes. Conventional workflows by clinical microbiology laboratories require ~24 hours for Candida speciation to allow isolate growth on agar plates. We developed CanID-PCR, a simple, inexpensive PCR-based tool for rapid Candida identification directly from positive blood culture bottles. The assay targets the ACT1 gene, which contains a variable-length intron enabling discrimination among nine common Candida species. CanID-PCR was optimized for genomic DNA extracted directly from positive blood culture bottles and tested on 64 patient samples. Overall, species identification matched the clinical microbiology laboratory with 99% of concordance. One limitation was the inability to distinguish C. parapsilosis from C. metapsilosis, which are highly similar members of the C. parapsilosis complex. The unique discrepancy involved a failure to detect C. tropicalis in a mixed infection with C. glabrata. Among a total of seven samples with two species, one sample had a second species: C. fabianii (Cyberlindnera fabianii), detected only by CanID-PCR, but was missed by the clinical laboratory. These findings demonstrate that CanID-PCR can reveal polymicrobial Candida infections often overlooked when only a few selected colonies are analyzed. CanID-PCR provides rapid, accurate Candida speciation without the need for additional culture, requiring only standard laboratory equipment. This low-cost, straightforward approach is suitable for research laboratories, resource-limited clinical settings, or scenarios where timely species-level identification is critical.IMPORTANCEIdentifying species in Candida infections is of utmost importance to clinicians and researchers alike. Here, we describe CanID-PCR: a quick and low-cost PCR tool to identify Candida species on genomic DNA directly extracted from positive blood cultures. This technique uses basic laboratory equipment, and there is no need for high investment in special equipment. The tool allows identification of the nine most prevalent species in candidiasis. The technique is simple and can be used without the need for an additional culture to isolate the cells. It is noteworthy to mention that this tool can detect polymicrobial infections caused by more than one Candida species."
41230775,Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II: Significantly Elevated in Obstructive Jaundice and Sepsis Patients Without Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,2025,"BACKGROUND: PIVKA-II is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC. However, a particular PIVKA-II variant can be abnormally elevated in patients with obstructive jaundice or sepsis, complicating its interpretation in HCC conditions. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the distribution and positive rates of serum PIVKA-II and AFP in patients with obstructive jaundice or sepsis, and to explore their relationships with laboratory tests, particularly coagulation function indexes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off, specificity and sensitivity of PIVKA-II in diagnosing HCC. RESULTS: In patients with obstructive jaundice and sepsis, PIVKA-II was significantly positively correlated with PT and INR. When the cut-off was 42.17 mAU/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of PIVKA-II in diagnosing HCC were 74.69% and 70.17%, respectively. There was no difference in PIVKA-II concentration between HCC and obstructive jaundice. PIVKA-II levels in obstructive jaundice and sepsis were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Except for healthy individuals, the positive rate of serum PIVKA-II was significantly higher than that of AFP among the other three groups, and patients with obstructive jaundice had the highest positive rate of PIVKA-II. CONCLUSIONS: The PIVKA-II produced by HCC may differ from that produced by obstructive jaundice and sepsis. Given that PIVKA-II levels are abnormally elevated in patients with obstructive jaundice and sepsis, the results should be interpreted with caution in patients with HCC combined with these diseases."
41230207,Clinical and Molecular Evaluation of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome with the BWSICS Score.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, MIM#130650) is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by macroglossia, omphalocele, macrosomia, and a predisposition to neoplasia. The etiology of BWS involves genetic and epigenetic alterations in the 11p15 region of the genome. In this study, we investigated how the International Consensus Clinical Scoring System (BWSICS) score can be used in clinical and molecular evaluations and examined its contribution to diagnostic processes. METHODS: This retrospective study included BWS patients who have been followed up in the pediatric genetics clinic of a center in the last 10 years. Clinical and molecular outcomes including chromosome analysis, microarray analysis, and MS-MLPA testing were evaluated. BWSICS scores were calculated for each patient based on their clinical symptoms. RESULTS: The study evaluated 18 patients who met BWS diagnostic criteria aged between 1 day and 10 years. The main presentations were macroglossia in 4 patients, omphalocele with macroglossia in 5 patients, and hypoglycemia in 2 patients and all but 1 patient was macrosomia. Significant congenital malformations included omphalocele and visceromegaly in 5 patients each. Hepatoblastoma was observed in 1 patient and 1 patient died due to sepsis. Two patients had autism spectrum disorder while the others had normal neuromotor development. According to the BWSICS, patients' scores ranged from 5 to 11. Molecular analysis revealed methylation alterations in 13/16 patients. CONCLUSION: This study examined the effectiveness of the BWSICS score in the diagnosis and follow-up of BWS in combination with clinical and molecular evaluation. This score provides a broad assessment in the diagnosis of BWS and can be considered as an important tool in clinical practice."
41229934,Lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio as a predictor of 28-day mortality in critically Ill patients with gastrointestinal cancers: Insights from machine learning and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LDAR) predicts 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies and to quantify its incremental value in machine learning (ML) models. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Medical Information Mart For Intensive Care IV (2008-2019). Adults with GI malignancies who met Sepsis-3 within 24 h of their first intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. LDAR was computed from laboratory results obtained within 24 h. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Associations were estimated with multivariable logistic regression; nonlinearity was evaluated using restricted cubic splines. Multiple ML classifiers (AdaBoost, XGBoost, random forest) were trained with a 7:3 split and 5-fold cross-validation. Discrimination (area under the curve-AUC), clinical utility (decision-curve analysis), and interpretability (Shapley additive explanation-SHAP) were assessed. Prespecified subgroup analyses stratified by metastatic status and infection site were performed. Covariates included age, sex, weight, vital signs, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and metastatic status. Missingness was handled with multiple imputation by chained equations. RESULTS: Among 1177 patients, 28-day mortality was 48.4%. Higher LDAR was independently associated with death; the adjusted odds ratio for Q4 vs Q1 was 5.15 (95% CI 3.52-7.61; P < 0.001). Spline analyses showed a steep risk rise above log2(LDAR) = 5.314 ( approximately 40). Effects were directionally consistent across subgroups with no significant LDAR x metastatic interaction (P = 0.084) and borderline heterogeneity by infection site (P = 0.051). The best ML model, AdaBoost, achieved an AUC of 0.835 and yielded the largest net clinical benefit across clinically relevant thresholds. SHAP ranked LDAR among the most influential predictors. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure codings produced concordant estimates. Model calibration was acceptable. CONCLUSION: LDAR is a simple, interpretable, and independently prognostic biomarker for 28-day mortality in ICU patients with GI malignancies. Incorporating LDAR into ML models improved discrimination and decision benefit over conventional severity scores, supporting LDAR-based early risk stratification. External multicenter validation and evaluation of dynamic LDAR trajectories are warranted, and transparent analytic reporting."
41229929,Decoding sepsis: A technical blueprint for an algorithm-driven system architecture.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in healthcare, requiring rapid detection and intervention. This paper presents a scalable, serverless machine learning (ML) operations architecture for near real-time sepsis risk-stratification in Emergency Department (ED) waiting rooms, where pathology data is often unavailable and recognising sepsis presents the biggest opportunity for timely treatment. METHODS: The system integrates HL7 message processing through MuleSoft in a secure Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment, leveraging AWS services such as Lambda for real-time data processing and SageMaker for ML model deployment. To optimise the model's performance, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate different cutoff thresholds of probability across different age groups (16-35, 35-65, and 65-115), aiming for >80% sensitivity and minimise false negatives. Processed data is stored in Aurora PostgreSQL Relational Database Service and visualised in an on-premises proprietary dashboard for clinical decision support. RESULTS: Despite high reliability, with 99.7% of HL7 messages successfully processed, limitations include occasional failures due to downtime and code set mismatches, as well as peak execution times of 10.5 s under heavy loads, highlighting areas for optimisation. Model development of eligible ED encounters (n =  484,617) using XG Boost was integrated as a real-time endpoint in SageMaker. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.84) and F1-score (0.80), with balanced sensitivity and specificity for our specified limited features within an ED. ROC for age groups (16-35, 36-65, 66-115), showed strong performance in all cohorts (AUCs: 0.864, 0.867, 0.806). CONCLUSION: This paper outlines the system's design, implementation, and potential for enhancing early sepsis risk-stratification through near real-time monitoring in the ED waiting room."
41229676,"Bidirectional Regulatory Roles in the Immune Modulation, Organ Dysfunction, and Therapy of Sepsis.",2025,"Exosomes have emerged as central mediators in sepsis pathogenesis and therapy. Exosomes play an important role in cell communication by transferring functional proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids to recipient cells. Recently, Low-immunogenic exosomes serve as novel biomarkers in sepsis, and they confer a 46% enhancement in survival benefit in animal models. However, exosomes drive the early inflammatory storm and late immune paralysis in sepsis. There are also limitations related to heterogeneity and translational barriers. Therefore, this review discusses the basic signaling pathways underlying the bidirectional effects of exosomes in the pathogenesis and treatment of sepsis, the interaction between organ dysfunction and exosomes in sepsis, the current progress in exosome therapy for sepsis, as well as the challenges and limitations faced in this field. In summary, exosomes have bright prospects in diagnosis and clinical translation, as well as the potential for standardized production."
41229649,From Crisis to Recovery: Life-Saving IgM-Enriched Immunoglobulin Rescue Therapy in Severe CAP and Refractory Post-Partum Septic Shock - A Dramatic 24-Hour Turnaround.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock in the postpartum period is a life-threatening condition associated with significant mortality. The physiological changes of pregnancy and the puerperium often complicate diagnosis and treatment, making timely, effective intervention critical. When conventional antimicrobial therapy fails, alternative therapeutic strategies become essential. Recent systematic reviews have highlighted the potential benefits of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin in reducing mortality among sepsis patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 25-year-old previously healthy woman who developed severe septic shock following caesarean section delivery. The clinical picture was complicated by influenza A pneumonia and a urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli. Despite administration of broad-spectrum standard antimicrobial treatments, the patient exhibited rapid clinical deterioration, with escalating vasopressor requirements and severe hyperinflammation. Biomarkers were profoundly elevated, including a procalcitonin level of 386.2 ng/ml and a C-reactive protein of 424 mg/l. Given the failure of standard therapy and the critical condition, IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin((R))) was administered as a rescue therapy. Within 24 hours of infusion, the patient demonstrated significant clinical and biochemical improvement, with normalisation of vital signs, reduced inflammatory markers and early weaning from vasopressors. She achieved full recovery and rapid hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential life-saving role of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin and its potential therapeutic value in managing refractory postpartum sepsis and severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While promising, the timing, dosage and patient selection for this therapy require further clinical investigation, particularly in obstetric populations. LEARNING POINTS: IgM-enriched immunoglobulin therapy represents a viable adjunctive option for refractory sepsis, particularly in hyperinflammatory presentations. Early therapeutic intervention within 24 hours of refractory status may optimise clinical outcomes.Phenotype-based therapy selection can identify patients most likely to benefit from immunomodulatory interventions. Postpartum patients may experience worse outcome due to pregnancy-related immune modifications.Biomarker monitoring including procalcitonin and C-reactive protein can guide therapeutic decisions and evaluate treatment response."
41229629,"Quadruple Primary Malignancies: A Rare Case of Breast, Bladder, Lung, and Laryngeal Cancer.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Multiple primary cancer (MPC) is defined as two or more primary malignant tumours in the same or a different organ that are simultaneous or metachronous. The reported incidence of MPC varies between 2 to 17%. The vast majority are patients with two primary neoplasms, while quadruple cancers are extremely rare. We present the first documented case of quadruple primary malignant neoplasms, comprising breast ductal carcinoma, papillary urothelial carcinoma, laryngeal fibrosarcoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old female first presented in 2006 with a palpable lump in the right breast and was first diagnosed with breast cancer. In 2010, following haematuria, urothelial carcinoma in the bladder was identified, with more than 15 recurrences in a 13-year period. In 2014 urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter was detected. She developed hoarseness and in 2019 a laryngeal fibrosarcoma was found. During follow-up in 2022, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. The patient received multiple rounds of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical interventions. In June 2023 the patient died due to chemotherapy-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of adapting treatment to the individual patient, long-term monitoring and the necessity. LEARNING POINTS: Long-term multidisciplinary follow-up is essential for patients with multiple primary malignancies, as timely surveillance can enable early detection and management of new cancers.Individualized treatment decisions are crucial when standard surgical or chemoradiation options are limited by treatment intolerance or patient refusal.Delayed initiation of appropriate sepsis management can critically impact patient outcomes; despite optimal subsequent treatment, disease progression may become irreversible."
41229429,Diagnostic efficiency of inflammatory signatures to distinguish isolated candidemia from candidemia with bacterial co-infection.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: To identify the differences in inflammatory response between critically ill patients responding to combined bacterial-fungal sepsis and those with isolated fungal sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study compared ICU patients who were exposed (n=24) and unexposed (n=20) to candidemia. Two exposure modes were analyzed: isolated candidemia (C; n=12) versus candidemia with bacterial co-infection (BC; n=12). Targeted proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to examine differences in serum inflammatory proteome between groups. Differential inflammatory proteins served as input for a logistic regression model to validate their effectiveness in discrimination. RESULTS: Two major clusters-candidemia cases and controls-were identified based on differential protein expression analysis. In five-fold cross-validation, LAP-TGF beta-1 was identified as the main driver, effectively distinguishing isolated candidemia [AUC 0.95; 95% CI 0.853-1.000]. TRANCE and IL-17C showed potential as a diagnostic signature indicating bacterial co-infection in the context of candidemia. DISCUSSION: The three-protein logistic regression panel (LAP-TGF beta-1, TRANCE and IL-17C) differentiated cases with isolated candidemia from those with candidemia and bacterial co-infection [AUC 0.82; 95% CI 0.629-0.968]. A three-protein inflammatory signature distinguished isolated fungal sepsis from combined bacterial-fungal sepsis. This study is the first to explore the inflammatory response to differentiate isolated candidemia from candidemia with bacterial co-infection."
41229414,Circulating NETs enable early identification of thrombotic risk in sepsis at emergency care onset.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis involves a dysregulated host response to infection and is frequently complicated by coagulopathy, contributing to organ dysfunction and mortality. Early detection of coagulation disturbances in the emergency department (ED) remains clinically challenging. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have emerged as key mediators linking inflammation and thrombosis in sepsis, yet their prognostic value during early care is unclear. This study aimed to assess whether circulating NETs measured at sepsis onset are associated with inflammatory biomarkers, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) status, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 212 adult patients with sepsis recruited at the ED presentation. Plasma NETs, IL-6, and MR-ProADM were measured by ELISA. The ISTH SIC score was used to identify early-stage coagulopathy. RESULTS: Circulating NETs were detected in 61 patients (28.8%) and higher NETs levels were significantly associated with elevated D-dimer, LDH, IL-6, PCT, and hypocholesterolemia. NETs positive patients had increased odds of positive blood cultures (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), thromboembolic events (OR = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.0-19.0), and SOFA >/= 5 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-2.9). Among 202 patients with complete data to SIC evaluation, 49% met SIC criteria. Although NETs were not independently associated with SIC, their inflammatory and clinical impact was significantly amplified in SIC-positive patients, suggesting a synergetic interaction between NETosis and early coagulopathy. DISCUSSION: NETs quantification at ED presentation may help identify a high-risk immunothrombotic phenotype in sepsis and support earlier NETosis-targeted therapies alongside anticoagulation."
41228546,Safety Assessment and Probiotic Potential of a Novel Species Lactobacillus xujianguonis.,2025,"Background: Some lactobacilli strains have been documented to cause bacteremia and sepsis in immunocompromised or critically ill hospitalized patients, challenging the universally presumed safety of lactobacilli. Therefore, strain-specific risk assessments are required for the use of Lactobacillus as a probiotic. Lactobacillus xujianguonis, a novel Lactobacillus species isolated from Marmota himalayana, has probiotic potential but lacks safety data. Objective: To evaluate the preclinical safety of L. xujianguonis for food-grade use. Methods: Systematic safety assessment includes in vitro studies and oral toxicity studies. In vitro studies encompassed gastrointestinal tolerance, auto-aggregation and pathogen inhibition, antibiotic susceptibility, and hemolysis/gelatinase activity assays. Oral toxicity studies contained acute single-dose and repeated-dose 28-day oral toxicity studies in mice based on the OECD toxicity study guidelines. Results: L. xujianguonis strains HT111-2 and 06-2 demonstrated certain probiotic traits, including high acid/bile tolerance, strong auto-aggregation, and antimicrobial activity against common human gastrointestinal pathogens. In vitro safety assessments showed susceptibility to nine antibiotics and absence of hemolytic/gelatinase activity. Acute oral exposure (1 x 10(11) CFU/kg) induced no mortality, clinical abnormalities, or organ toxicity. Subchronic 28-day administration (multiple doses) showed absence of adverse clinical signs with body weight stability and no hematological, biochemical, or histopathological deviations in C57BL/6 mice. Inflammatory and immunological markers remained unaffected. Histological staining results and transcriptional level validation revealed no evidence of intestinal tissue damage. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the safety of L. xujianguonis, supporting its advancement to functional research."
41228476,"Lactoferrin, a Natural Protein with Multiple Functions in Health and Disease.",2025,"Lactoferrin is a multifunctional glycoprotein showing multiple biological properties (antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, antigenotoxic, prebiotic, probiotic) that play an essential role in maintaining host physiological homeostatic condition by exerting immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Thanks to these biological properties, lactoferrin has widely been studied as a therapeutic agent in gastroenteric diseases, neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, lung diseases, and COVID-19, showing very heterogeneous results based on the disease considered and the population studied. Since lactoferrin is one of the main components of neutrophils' secondary granules, it has also been investigated as a potential disease-monitoring biomarker, especially for diseases in which inflammation is a key component. This narrative review offers updated and comprehensive insights into the available literature on lactoferrin biology, biological properties, and clinical utility."
41228054,Hemodynamic Heterogeneity in Community-Acquired Sepsis at Intermediate Care Admission: A Prospective Pilot Study Using Impedance Cardiography.,2025,"Background: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome in which patients with similar clinical presentations at admission may exhibit markedly different treatment responses and outcomes, suggesting that comparable macroscopic features can conceal profoundly distinct perfusion and hemodynamic states. Aim: This study aimed to characterize the hemodynamic profile of patients with community-acquired sepsis, assess its correlation with macro-hemodynamic indices, compare fluid responders with non-responders, and explore the prognostic value of early identification of a feature consistent with distributive shock. Methods: A prospective observational pilot study was conducted in the Intermediate Medical Care Unit (IMCU) of Ospedale Alto Vicentino (Santorso, Italy), September 2024-May 2025. 115 consecutive adults with community-acquired sepsis underwent NICaS((R)) bioimpedance assessment at IMCU admission. Sepsis was diagnosed at IMCU admission as suspected/confirmed infection plus an acute increase in total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) >/= 2 points. Hemodynamic indices were analyzed in relation to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and mean arterial pressure (MAP), fluid responsiveness, and 30-day mortality. Results: Hemodynamics were heterogeneous across patients and within SOFA strata. SOFA showed no correlation with SV, SI, CO, or CI; weak inverse associations for TPR (r = -0.198, p = 0.034) and TPRI (r = -0.241, p = 0.009) were observed. MAP did not correlate with SV, SI, CO, or CI, but correlated positively with TPR (r = 0.461) and TPRI (r = 0.547) and with CPI (rho = 0.550), all p < 0.001. A distributive profile was present in 21.7% (25/115), increasing with higher SOFA (p = 0.033); only 20% of those with this profile had MAP < 65 mmHg at admission. Fluid non-responders (27.8%) had lower resistance and higher CI (4.1 vs. 3.4 L/min/m(2); p = 0.015). The distributive profile was not associated with 30-day mortality (log-rank p = 0.808). Conclusions: In IMCU patients with community-acquired sepsis, macro-indices (SOFA, MAP) correlate poorly with the underlying hemodynamic state. Early noninvasive profiling reveals within-SOFA circulatory heterogeneity and may support operational, individualized resuscitation strategies; these pilot findings are hypothesis-generating and warrant prospective interventional testing."
41227253,Relationship Between Retinal Vascular Measurements and Anthropometric Indices in Patients Diagnosed with Persistent COVID-19.,2025,"Introduction: Persistent COVID-19 is associated with microvascular dysfunction, with retinal vessels as potential early biomarkers. Obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, contributes to this dysfunction; however, the body mass index (BMI) is limited in its ability to assess it. Therefore, more precise alternative anthropometric indices have been proposed, although their relationship with retinal vascular caliber in persistent COVID-19 has not been studied. Objective: To analyze the relationship between different anthropometric measurements and the caliber of retinal vessels in an adult population with persistent COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study and included individuals diagnosed with persistent COVID-19. Retinal images were obtained using a non-mydriatic retinograph. The anthropometric variables used included: waist and hip circumference, BMI, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), Body Roundness Index (BRI), Abdominal Volume Index (AVI), and body composition parameters measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: The sample included 284 participants (mean age: 52.7 years; 31.8% men). Men exhibited greater general and abdominal adiposity. The AV Index was negatively associated with various anthropometric indicators (BMI, BRI, waist circumference, and AVI), while venular caliber showed positive associations with all these indices, except for BMI (p < 0.05 for all). No significant correlations were found between anthropometric values and arteriolar caliber. These associations persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and pharmacological treatment. Conclusions: Individuals with obesity are associated with alterations in retinal vessels in patients with persistent COVID-19, evidenced by an increase in venous caliber and a decrease in the AV Index. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously."
41227034,The Impact of Age on In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Sepsis: Findings from a Nationwide Study.,2025,"Background: Age is a well-established determinant of sepsis outcomes, often integrated into severity scoring systems. However, most studies focus on critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs), with limited insight into how age influences mortality in non-ICU settings, particularly across the full adult lifespan. Objective: To investigate the relationship between age and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis hospitalized in internal medicine wards, using age-stratified logistic and spline regression models. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study involving 4300 adult patients admitted to internal medicine wards at eight academic hospitals affiliated with Clalit Health Services in Israel between December 2001 and October 2020. All patients were diagnosed with sepsis during hospitalization and died during their hospital stay. Patients were stratified into seven age groups (18-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, >85 years). Logistic regression identified age-specific comorbidities associated with mortality. Adjusted spline regression models were used to estimate mortality probabilities across age ranges. Results: The cohort had a mean age at death of 78.84 years, and 51.7% were female. Mortality probability increased with age but demonstrated non-linear trends. Sharp fluctuations in predicted mortality were observed in middle-aged groups (especially ages 45-54), with peaks not captured in conventional binary or linear models. Hematologic and solid neoplasms were strongly associated with mortality in younger groups, while cardiovascular comorbidities such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation were more prominent in older adults. Conclusions: Age is a major determinant of in-hospital mortality in septic patients on internal medicine wards, but its effect is non-linear and age-specific. Our findings highlight a unique population of patients with severe sepsis not managed in critical care settings and underscore the need for more nuanced, age-stratified risk assessment models outside of the ICU."
41226345,Association of NOS Gene Polymorphisms with Sepsis-Related Complications in Secondary Peritonitis.,2025,"Secondary peritonitis (SP) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high complication rates and it often results in sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. This study investigated the association between four nitric oxide synthase (NOS) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-NOS3 c.-786T>C (rs2070744), NOS3 c.894G>T (rs1799983), NOS3 27 bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) (rs61722009), and NOS2 (rs2297518)-and sepsis-related complications in 202 patients with SP. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, Mannheim Peritonitis Index, and complications (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), multiple organ failure (MOF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis) were analyzed for associations with the NOS gene variants. Haplotype analysis was also performed. No SNP showed an association with in-hospital mortality. However, the NOS3 c.-786T>C TT genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of MOF (p = 0.008), and remained independently associated after multivariate adjustment (p(MOF) = 0.006). The T4bG haplotype was significantly more frequent among patients with MODS (p = 0.026), MOF (p = 0.048), and sepsis (p = 0.018). These findings suggest that NOS gene variants, particularly NOS3 c.-786T>C and the T4bG haplotype, may potentially serve as biomarkers for risk stratification in critically ill patients."
41226019,Early Sepsis Prediction Using Publicly Available Data: High-Performance AI/ML Models with First-Hour Clinical Information.,2025,"Objectives: Early identification of sepsis is critical, as delayed diagnosis significantly increases morbidity and mortality. We aimed to develop and validate AI/ML models for early sepsis prediction using structured electronic health record (EHR) data, waveform data, and a combination of both. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study using the AIM-AHEAD60 subset of the CHoRUS dataset. Adult patients (>/=18 years) with a final diagnosis of sepsis were included. Structured EHR data (demographics, initial vital signs, laboratory results) and waveform data (continuous vital signs) from the first hour of hospital arrival were extracted. Three algorithms (i.e., XGBoost, LightGBM, and HistGB) were developed with a focus on maximizing the performance metric of recall. Other performance metrics were also assessed, including accuracy, precision, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: A total of 11,312 unique patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 2245 individuals (19.85%) were diagnosed with sepsis at least once. Using structured EHR data alone, laboratory variables such as lactate and leukocyte count were most predictive. Waveform models identified respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and temperature trends in the first hour as key predictors. Combined models highlighted mean temperature and mean systolic blood pressure as top features. XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.922) across all data configurations, with a recall above 80%, demonstrating robust performance despite substantial missing data. Conclusions: High-performing AI/ML models for early sepsis prediction can be developed from publicly available datasets using only first-hour clinical information. XGBoost models demonstrate strong potential for real-time clinical screening."
41225969,"Clinical Value of Galectin-9, Soluble TREM-1, and Soluble CD25 Among Critically Ill Patients with Organ Failure in the Emergency Department: A Prospective Observational Study.",2025,"Background/Objectives: This study investigated clinical value of galectin-9 (Gal-9), a soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), and soluble CD25 (sCD25) among critically ill patients with organ failure in the emergency department. Methods: Overall, 786 patients were enrolled and classified into non-infectious organ failure (NIOF, n = 331), sepsis (n = 266), and septic shock (n = 189). The diagnostic value of Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the biomarkers was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox proportional hazard model analyses. Results: Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 could discriminate sepsis from NIOF (Gal-9, area under the curve [AUC], 0.599-0.678; sTREM-1, AUC, 0.616-0.695; sCD25, AUC, 0.710-0.781) and septic shock from sepsis (Gal-9, AUC, 0.562-0.667; sTREM-1, AUC, 0.572-0.676; sCD25, AUC, 0.555-0.660), respectively. Sepsis patients with higher levels of biomarkers over their cut-off value showed higher 30-day mortality compared to those with lower levels below the cut-off value (Gal-9 >/= 14,391.80 ng/L, p < 0.001; sTREM-1 >/= 580.62 ng/L, p < 0.001; sCD25 >/= 1639.29 ng/L, p < 0.001; respectively) (log-rank test). sCD25 is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Conclusions: Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 showed diagnostic and prognostic value in critically ill patients with organ failure. sCD25 can predict the 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 could serve as auxiliary biomarkers to support clinicians in effective sepsis management."
41225612,Influence of early enteral nutrition on mortality of adult patients with sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early enteral nutrition (EEN) has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with sepsis. However, the survival benefit of EEN remains uncertain. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of EEN on all-cause mortality in adult patients with sepsis. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang was conducted up to May 25, 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EEN (initiated within 24-48 h of admission or sepsis diagnosis) vs. non-early enteral nutrition (delayed enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition) in adult septic patients were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model by incorporating the influence of potential heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 582 patients (281 EEN, 301 controls) were included. Compared to controls, EEN significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.59; 95% CI 0.37-0.94; p = 0.03), with no significant statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results (OR range: 0.48-0.67; all p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed the mortality benefit of EEN was consistent across subgroups defined by sepsis severity (OR: 0.61 vs. 0.56), sepsis diagnostic criteria (Sepsis-1.0/2.0: OR 0.83 vs. Sepsis-3.0: OR 0.51), patient age, sex distribution, EEN initiation time (within 24 vs. 48 h), and mortality follow-up duration (p for subgroup difference all > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EEN significantly reduces mortality in adult patients with sepsis. High-quality RCTs are warranted to determine the optimal regimen of EEN in this population."
41225524,Platelet parameters as potential biomarkers for sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a major global health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited diagnostic resources. This meta-analysis evaluates platelet index ratios (mean platelet volume-to-platelet count, MPV/PLT; platelet distribution width-to-platelet count, PDW/PLT; and platelet distribution width-to-plateletcrit, PDW/PCT) as cost-effective biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for studies evaluating platelet parameter ratios in sepsis. Inclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) cohort/case-control designs; (2) non-duplicated datasets; (3) available quantitative data for meta-analysis. Exclusion criteria included reviews, abstracts, letters to the editor, and studies with incomplete data. Synthesis methods employed random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) and diagnostic metrics (sensitivity, specificity, etc.), with heterogeneity assessed via I-squared statistics. Publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. The results revealed that MPV/PLT ratios were significantly higher in neonatal (SMD = 1.48, P = 0.004) and adult sepsis patients (SMD = 0.35, P < 0.001) than in controls. Survivors had significantly lower MPV/PLT ratios than non-survivors in both children/neonate (SMD = 0.67, P < 0.01) and adult group (SMD = 0.41, P < 0.01), with similar trends observed in longitudinal assessments. PDW/PLT was also lower in pediatric survivors (P = 0.009), while no significant differences were found for MPV/PCT in neonates or PDW/PLT in adults. For diagnosing sepsis, MPV/PLT had a sensitivity of 0.55 and specificity of 0.71 in adults, and 0.58 and 0.87 in neonates. For predicting mortality, neonatal sepsis showed higher sensitivity (89%) and specificity (73%) than adult sepsis (63%, 58%). In LMICs, MPV/PLT was elevated at admission in both age groups but was linked to survival only in neonates. CONCLUSION: The MPV/PLT ratio shows promise as a cost-effective biomarker for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis, particularly in neonatal patients, with important potential applications in LMICs.

41225518,"Study protocol for a multicenter, multinational prospective randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes in subjects with Gram-negative bacteremia who have blood culture evaluation using Fast Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing vs. standard of care testing: the FAST trial.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Novel, rapid blood culture diagnostics can provide faster antibiotic susceptibility results (AST) compared to standard methods but their impact on clinical outcomes is unclear and not assessed in many prospective clinical trials. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, multicenter, multinational, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in countries with high antibiotic resistance rates including Greece, India, Israel, and Spain. Nine hundred hospitalized subjects who have blood cultures collected as part of routine clinical care with growth of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) will be randomized 1:1 to blood culture evaluation using standard of care (SOC) AST vs. a rapid phenotypic AST method, VITEK REVEAL in addition to SOC AST. Subjects in both study arms will be reviewed by antibiotic stewardship clinicians who will recommend changes to antibiotic therapy, if indicated. The primary outcome is a composite three-category Desirability of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) defined using three ordered levels: alive without deleterious events, alive with at least one deleterious event, and death. Key secondary outcomes include mortality, length of stay, and time to antibiotic escalation or de-escalation within 3 days of randomization. Exploratory outcomes include a five-category DOOR, categorial agreement between VITEK REVEAL and SOC testing, clinician compliance with antibiotic stewardship recommendations, and desirability of treatment selection based on antibiotic spectrum, activity, and bloodstream isolate susceptibility profile (DOOR MAT). The primary analysis will be conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate whether use of a rapid phenotypic AST method improves outcomes compared to use of conventional methods for patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections in clinical settings with high antibiotic resistance rates.

41225453,De novo CHD7 variant in a CHARGE syndrome preterm infant initially diagnosed as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: a case report and literature review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: CHARGE syndrome (CS), a rare and complex autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ocular coloboma, cardiac defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear malformations, is caused primarily by variants in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene. The clinical manifestations of CS frequently overlap with those of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), complicating diagnosis and management. To date, only a few cases of preterm infants with CS have been reported. Here, we describe the clinical features and genetic findings of a very preterm male infant who was initially diagnosed with IHH but was ultimately confirmed to have CS, carrying a de novo heterozygous CHD7 variant, highlighting the diagnostic and management challenges associated with this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A preterm male infant, born at 28 + 2 weeks with a birth weight of 1.15 kg, presented with micropenis and right radial polydactyly. Initial suspicion of IHH arose due to micropenis, cryptorchidism, and low levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH. Despite normal cranial MRI findings, further investigations revealed hsPDA, aortic arch narrowing, renal pelvis separation, and EEG abnormalities. Comprehensive genetic analyses, including whole-exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, and a Mini-gene Assay, confirmed the presence of a pathogenic de novo splicing variant in the CHD7 gene [c.5405-7G > A (NM_017780.4)]. As dysmorphic features progressed, the diagnosis was revised from IHH to CHARGE syndrome. Despite surgical and supportive treatments, the infant developed CRE sepsis and passed away after the withdrawal of life support. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CS with polydactyly in a very preterm infant at approximately 28 weeks gestation. Furthermore, we summarized the clinical and genetic findings of previously reported cases with overlapping CS and IHH phenotypes. This study expands the clinical phenotypes of CHD7-related disorders and provides new insights into early diagnosis, management, and future research on the relationship between CS and IHH."
41225411,Intramedullary nailing versus plate fixation for humeral shaft fractures in geriatric patients: a retrospective cohort study assessing functional outcomes and complication rates.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Humeral shaft fractures, accounting for 1-3% of adult fractures, increasingly require surgical intervention due to high nonunion rates. This study compares outcomes of intramedullary nailing and plate fixation in older adults. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 55 patients with humeral shaft fractures treated at the Mohamed Taieb Kassab Orthopedic Institute between 2014 and 2022. The cohort included 32 patients managed with intramedullary nailing (IMN) and 23 with dynamic compression plating (DCP). Demographics, fracture characteristics (AO classification), operative duration, union duration, functional outcomes (modified Stewart and Hundley criteria, Constant-Murley score), and complications were evaluated. Statistical analysis used SPSS v19.0. RESULTS: Mean age was 64.7 years, with male predominance (40 male, 15 female and a gender ratio of 2.6). IMN was preferred for middle-third (58%) and AO type A fractures (79.4%), while DCP dominated complex fractures (76.2% type B/C with p < 0.05).IMN demonstrated shorter operative duration (60.2 +/- 4.4 vs. 105.9 +/- 7.7 min and p < 0.001). Fracture union averaged 19.9 +/- 7.9 weeks, with no intergroup difference (p = 0.360). Functional outcomes (76.4% good or excellent) were comparable between techniques (p > 0.05), but DCP yielded superior Constant-Murley scores (91.1 +/- 10.5 vs. 80.6 +/- 15.4 and p = 0.007). Complications included shoulder stiffness (25% IMN, 0% DCP and p = 0.015), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) (15.6% IMN, 0% DCP), sepsis (4.3% DCP, 0% IMN), and radial nerve palsy (4.3% DCP, 0% IMN). CONCLUSION: IMN offers faster surgery and lower infection risk but higher shoulder morbidity. Plate fixation excels in complex fractures with better functional scores but longer operative duration and infection risk. Considering these factors, DCP may be the preferred approach in older adults compared to IMN, particularly when functional optimization is a priority. The choice of surgical technique should be guided by fracture characteristics, patient's specific factors, and surgeon expertise."
41225381,"Analysis of the association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, MPV-to-platelet ratio, and clinical risk factors for mortality in ICU patients with candidemia: a 10-year retrospective analysis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is a leading cause of mortality in hospitalized patients. The determination of risk factors is necessary to predict mortality. We aimed to evaluate whether the neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts; red blood cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) and MPV/platelet count (MPV/plt) ratios, and other clinical characteristics are risk factors for mortality. METHODS: This study was retrospective and observational. Patients aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2024, who had Candida detected via blood culture, were included in the study. Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts; RDW, MPV, N/L, and MPV/plt ratios, and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded in the patient form. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. RESULTS: The mean age of the 468 patients was 64.26 +/- 15.9 years, and 204 (43.6%) were female. A total of 321 patients (68.6%) died. The most common comorbid disease was malignancy (n = 171, 36.5%), whereas 482 candidemia episodes were detected. Candida parapsilosis (n = 239, 49.6%) was the most frequently isolated strain. Diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, N/L, and MPV/plt ratios were found to be associated with mortality in univariate analysis, but none were found to be risk factors for mortality in multivariate regression analysis. Higher age, congestive heart failure (CHF), higher neutrophil count, RDW > 17.1 /%, low albumin level, low platelet count, lymphocyte count < 1000 /mm3, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), mechanical ventilation (MV), immunosuppressive drug use and Candida glabrata were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality remains high among ICU patients with candidemia. This ten-year analysis identified advanced age, CHF, elevated RDW, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, TPN, MV, immunosuppressive therapy, and candidemia caused by C. glabrata were identified as independent risk factors for mortality. Integrating haematological and clinical parameters in a risk stratification model may help to reduce mortality rates. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41225362,Association between serum potassium and 28-day mortality in elderly patients with sepsis: a multicenter cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: While dyskalemia is known to affect outcomes in critically ill patients, its specific impact on elderly septic patients remains unclear. Previous studies in general intensive care unit (ICU) populations have shown a U-shaped relationship between serum potassium and mortality, but this pattern may differ in elderly patients with sepsis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 12,069 patients aged >/= 65 years with sepsis from 208 U.S. hospitals using the eICU Collaborative Research Database (2014-2015). Patients were categorized based on their admission serum potassium levels: hypokalemia (< 3.5 mmol/L), normokalemia (3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and hyperkalemia (> 5.0 mmol/L). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Among the cohort (mean age 77.0 [7.6] years; 50.6% women), 16.4% had hypokalemia, 73.2% had normokalemia, and 10.4% had hyperkalemia. In contrast to the U-shaped relationship previously reported in general ICU populations, we observed a significant linear association between serum potassium and 28-day mortality (P = .001). In the unadjusted model, each 1 mmol/L increase in serum potassium was associated with 65% higher odds of mortality (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.54-1.77]). This association was particularly pronounced in patients aged >/= 80 years (OR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.59-2.03]). After comprehensive adjustment for confounders, each 1 mmol/L increase in serum potassium was associated with 23% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39]). Compared to normokalemia, hyperkalemia carried significantly higher mortality risk (adjusted OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.11-1.88]). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the established U-shaped paradigm by demonstrating a linear relationship between serum potassium and mortality in elderly septic patients. This suggests that traditional approaches to potassium management may need modification in this vulnerable population, with greater emphasis on preventing hyperkalemia. These results provide a foundation for developing age-specific potassium management strategies in sepsis care."
41225313,The effectiveness of unfractionated heparin vs. low molecular weight (Enoxaparin) in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom (ARDS) and metabolic dysfunction: an old drug for new indication!,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a lung disorder defined by the acute onset of hypoxemia, the commonest being abdominal sepsis.Many biomarkers have been studied for diagnostic prognostication and ARDS pharmacotherapy. The current study aim to assess the protective effects of UFH versus Enoxaparin in sepsis-induced ARDS and related metabolic sequelae. METHODS: Sepsis was initiated through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Wistar rats were divided to: sham, CLP, CLP + unfractionated Heparin, and CLP + Enoxaparin and CLP + distilled water groups. Levels of serum Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leukotriene E4 (LTE4), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), interleukin-8 (IL-8), were quantified. Furthermore, mRNA expression of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) were assessed. Histopathological study was conducted to assess any lung injuries. RESULTS: Septic rats demonstrated higher levels of leukotriene E4, leukotriene B4, and interleukin-8, while treatment with unfractionated Heparin attenuated these levels but enoxaparin effectiveness on LTB-4 and IL-8 was not as significant as heparin while its was equally effective on LTE-4. Moreover, mRNA levels of RAGE and ANG-2 were enhanced in CLP rats. These elevations were mitigated by treatment with unfractionated Heparin and reduced by enoxaparin to a lesser extent. Treatment with unfractionated Heparin increased the lipoxin A4 and lipoprotein lipase levels but enoxaparin had no effect on the LPL level. Lung protective effect of unfractionated Heparin was further confirmed by histopathological observations of lung tissue samples. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that UFH can modulate ARDS and metabolic dysfunction in hyperinflammatory conditions like sepsis."
41224702,Congenital brucellosis in a newborn: A rare case report and clinical insights.,2025,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease with significant global health implications, particularly in endemic regions such as Saudi Arabia. It is characterized by clinical manifestations that mimic both infectious and noninfectious diseases, making diagnosis challenging. Congenital brucellosis, a rare entity, can be transmitted transplacentally from a bacteremic mother or through exposure to maternal secretions during delivery. This report describes the case of a neonate with extremely low birth weight and severe respiratory distress syndrome, who was ultimately diagnosed with congenital brucellosis caused by Brucella melitensis. Despite treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and rifampin, the infant developed abdominal distension and hypotension, showed a clinical picture consistent with sepsis, and succumbed on day 28 of life. This report underscores the importance of early recognition and management of congenital brucellosis to improve outcomes and highlights gaps in antenatal screening and preventive strategies. Diagnosis was confirmed by isolating B. melitensis from blood culture using standard microbiological methods. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 mg/kg/day) and rifampin (10 mg/kg/day). Clinical signs such as persistent hypoxemia and abdominal distension developed before death on day 28. Antenatal screening gaps in endemic regions such as Saudi Arabia contributed to delayed diagnosis."
41224687,Atresia at the gastroesophageal junction associated with left congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a diagnostic and surgical challenge.,2025,"Esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) are commonly seen in paediatric surgical practice but their coexistence is rare. We present a case of a term male neonate with left CDH and atresia at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The patient underwent left CDH repair with gastroesophageal anastomosis in the same sitting. The postoperative course was turbulent with the patient developing sepsis and requiring ventilator support, which was successfully managed. Once feeds were started, an oral dye study revealed smooth transit of dye into the stomach. He was discharged and was well at 1, 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Management of such unique cases can be challenging and the surgeon should be ready for intraoperative surprises."
41224189,A novel Gasdermin D C-terminal neo-epitope as a biomarker for pyroptosis in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis, a critical component of the innate immune response, is triggered by pathogenic microbial infections and plays a key role in host defense mechanisms. This process involves the cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases, releasing carboxy-terminal fragments (GSDMD-CT). Monitoring GSDMD-CT levels represents a promising approach for inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). METHODS: We developed an immunoassay to measure plasma GSDMD-CT concentrations in 109 healthy individuals, 137 patients with SIRS, and 100 patients with sepsis. The diagnostic utility of GSDMD-CT in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS or healthy controls was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, alongside correlations with procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Plasma GSDMD-CT levels were significantly elevated in patients with sepsis compared to healthy control and SIRS groups. ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.870, with a sensitivity of 91.0% and specificity of 60.6% for differentiating sepsis from healthy controls. Comparable performance was observed in distinguishing SIRS from healthy controls. Diagnostic accuracy was further enhanced when GSDMD-CT was combined with CRP. Strikingly, GSDMD-CT mirrored the kinetic profile of PCT in antibiotic-treated patients with bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: The GSDMD-CT assay demonstrates high sensitivity as a biomarker, offering potential for early and differential diagnosis of sepsis across diverse pathogens."
41224174,Lelliottia amnigena bacteremia in a patient with sigmoid colon cancer and schizophrenia: a case report.,2025,"Lelliottia amnigena is a facultative anaerobe that is generally considered to show low pathogenicity, and few reports have described human infection. We describe herein a case of bacteremia due to L. amnigena in a patient with sigmoid colon cancer and schizophrenia. A 64-year-old Japanese man with schizophrenia was transferred to our hospital from a psychiatric hospital after experiencing several weeks of bloody bowel discharge and fever. He presented with hypotension, an elevated white blood cell count, raised levels of C-reactive protein, and decreased hemoglobin levels. Blood culture on transfer to our hospital detected Gram-negative rods, identified as L. amnigena by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam, which was later de-escalated to ampicillin/sulbactam according to the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, resulting in a total of 14 days of antimicrobial treatment. Computed tomography and colonoscopy revealed that the patient had sigmoid colon cancer, which was subsequently surgically resected. The sigmoid colon cancer was considered to represent the gateway for L. amnigena entry into the bloodstream. The course of treatment was favorable and the patient was transferred back to the original hospital 98 days after admission. L. amnigena bacteremia has rarely been reported, and the present case appears to represent the first detailed description. L. amnigena can cause bacteremia and sometimes lead to serious conditions in patients."
41224108,Acute liver failure as a rare presentation of miliary tuberculosis with clinical improvement following prediagnostic corticosteroid therapy: A case report.,2026,"We report a rare case of miliary tuberculosis presenting as acute liver failure in a 72-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis. The patient was initially treated for septic shock due to suspected acute cholangitis and was administered hydrocortisone. However, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed no biliary obstruction. Despite stabilization, liver failure progressed, accompanied by coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Elevated ferritin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels raised concerns of lymphoma or virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. Prediagnostic corticosteroid pulse therapy was initiated on day 4, leading to improvement in liver function and hematologic parameters. Liver biopsy on day 8 revealed scattered noncaseating epithelioid granulomas with Langhans giant cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by polymerase chain reaction of sputum and urine, and confirmed by positive sputum and blood cultures. A four-drug antituberculous regimen was initiated on day 18. This case underscores that miliary tuberculosis can present as acute liver failure and mimic biliary sepsis. When cholangitis is unsubstantiated, performing liver biopsy is crucial. Additionally, corticosteroid therapy may provide clinical benefit in miliary tuberculosis complicated by liver failure or shock, regardless of the timing of antituberculous treatment."
41224076,Macrophage Activation-Like Syndrome in critically ill patients with sepsis: high risk patients with high mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Even though tremendous effort has been undertaken within the past 40 years, both sepsis incidence and mortality remain high. The concept of various immune responses in sepsis, ranging from immune paralysis to severe hyperinflammation, has gained more and more attention. As such, the hyperinflammatory phenotype macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS) became the cornerstone in the latest intervention trials. Our study sought to systematically investigate MALS patients, including their definitions, respective bone marrow markers and monocytic HLA-DR expressions. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a retrospective observational study, we included all patients aged >/=18 years and admitted to any adult ICU at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin between January 2006 and August 2018, who had hyperferritinemia (>/=500 mug/L) and sepsis, but no diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. For diagnosis of MALS, we used the latest definition of ferritin >/=4420 microg/L. RESULTS: 1629 patients were included, of whom 322 were diagnosed with MALS (19.8 %). In-hospital mortality was 62.4 % in MALS patients compared to 30.5 % in those without MALS. MALS patients had increased macrophage counts and higher rates of activated macrophages in bone marrow biopsies. HLA-DR expression did not differ significantly between the groups. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, MALS showed the highest odds ratio associated with in-hospital mortality. Different definitions of MALS identified largely distinct patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: MALS increased in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients. Our results underscore the urgent need for targeted research and therapeutic strategies. While promising insights into immune modulation have emerged, further studies are essential to refine treatment approaches and improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population."
41223876,Effects of adjunctive dobutamine on outcomes among patients with septic shock: a propensity score matching analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite some evidence supporting its utility, the role of adjunctive dobutamine in the management of septic shock remains unclear. METHODS: The nationwide prospective sepsis cohort of the Korean Sepsis Alliance was analyzed. Adult patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine were enrolled over a 29-month period. Patients given a dobutamine infusion within 3 days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were compared with patients who received no infusion. To balance baseline characteristics, propensity score matching (PSM) was used. RESULTS: Of 11,981 patients with sepsis, 1,827 patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine were included (108 dobutamine vs. 1,719 no dobutamine; mean age 71.4 +/- 13.2 years, 59.4% male). After PSM (ratio of 1:2; 105 dobutamine patients and 209 no-dobutamine patients), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and lactate levels on ICU day 3 did not significantly differ between groups. Additionally, in-hospital and ICU mortality rates did not differ between groups (54.3% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.319; 46.7% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.208, respectively). A Cox proportional model revealed that dobutamine use was not associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81-1.58). However, subgroup analysis indicated that dobutamine use was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality among patients in the lowest quintile of early fluid balance (p = 0.0286 for interaction). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive dobutamine administration did not improve short-term organ function or hospital outcomes in septic shock patients. However, early fluid balance may influence the impact of dobutamine, highlighting the importance of a more tailored approach."
41223391,"Impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on tolerability, clinical signs, lactatemia and glycemia in patients with pyometra.",2025,"This study evaluated the physical parameters, lactatemia, glycemia, and tolerability in canines with pyometra and sepsis who underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO(2)). Eighteen female dogs were randomly assigned to two groups: the hyperbaric group (HG) (three sequential sessions of HBO(2) [O(2) with 2 ATA for 45 min] after ovariohysterectomy) and the control group (CG) (ovariohysterectomy). Glycemia and lactatemia were measured at admission (T0), 1 hour after the end of the surgical procedure (T1), 24 hours (T2), 48 hours (T3), and 72 hours (T4) after surgery. Physical assessments were conducted at the same times, except for HG, which was assessed before and after each HBO session. There was no difference between the groups in relation to the physical parameters evaluated; however, rectal temperature was reduced in the group subjected to HBO(2). We observed an increase in lactate at T0 and T2, and a reduction at T3 and T4 in both groups. We did not identify changes in blood glucose levels. HBO(2) is acceptable and safe, but may reduce rectal temperature, although hypothermia can be expected in dogs with pyometra following the surgical procedure. Lactate may take up to 48 hours to begin, but it does not appear to be linked to prognosis or length of stay."
41222422,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Trauma 2007-2019: Comprehensive Patient and Center-Level Retrospective Cohort Analysis.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant complication in trauma patients. Yet the epidemiology of ARDS in trauma remains incompletely characterized. We sought to define trends in ARDS frequency and the effect of temporal, patient, and center-level factors on outcomes with the hypothesis that ARDS independently predicts mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hospitals submitting data to the American College of Surgeons National Trauma Data Bank. PATIENTS: Injured patients 18 years old or older from 2007 to 2019 on mechanical ventilation (MV) for greater than or equal to 2 days were included, and patients with ARDS were compared with those without ARDS. A subgroup with transfusion data was also identified. Multivariable logistic regression models by year adjusted for patient demographics, center characteristics, and blood products identified factors independently associated with ARDS diagnosis and 30-day hospital mortality. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 384,032 injured patients on MV, ARDS was documented in 29,359 (8 per 100 MV patients) with a significant decrease over the study period (22 in 2007 vs. 3 in 2019, p < 0.001). Patient-level risk factors independently associated with ARDS were blunt injury (odds ratio [OR] 1.25; 95% CI, 1.20-1.30), severe sepsis (OR 2.16; 95% CI, 2.06-2.27), ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 2.91; 95% CI, 2.82-3.00), and acute kidney injury (AKI, OR 2.98; 95% CI, 2.85 to 3.12). In the transfusion subset, 24-hour plasma (OR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04) and platelets (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05) were independently associated with ARDS. Crude ARDS mortality increased over the study period (2007, 15.1% vs. 2019, 29.7%, p < 0.001), and after adjusting for significant differences, ARDS was independently associated with 30-day hospital mortality (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.27-1.37). Independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS included head injury (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.43-1.66), severe sepsis (OR 1.48; 95% CI, 1.34-1.63), and AKI (OR 2.72; 95% CI, 2.50-2.96). Patients with ARDS managed in Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization centers were less likely to die (OR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: From 2007 to 2019, ARDS decreased significantly in trauma patients. Over the same time, mortality increased to nearly 30%, and after adjusting for other risks factors, ARDS was strongly associated with 30-day mortality. Future studies should examine modifiable patient and center-level factors to improve mortality in these high-risk patients."
41221756,A Case of Septic Shock Complicated by Abnormal Thyroid Hormone Levels.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe illness induces large changes in thyroid hormone economy. Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as low T3 syndrome, refers to thyroid hormone alterations induced by systemic or consumptive non-thyroidal diseases. These alterations strongly correlate with disease severity but are often overlooked in clinical practice. METHODS: Here we report a case of septic shock complicated by abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels. The patient presented with markedly reduced triiodothyronine (T3) and free triiodothyronine (fT3), profoundly suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and elevated free thyroxine (fT4) levels - a rare biochemical profile in clinical settings. Laboratory confirmation of significantly elevated rT3 levels established the diagnosis of low T3 syndrome. The transient fT4 elevation likely results from profound TSH suppression combined with sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokines, which directly inhibit D2 activity, alongside reduced thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels during the acute phase. The patient's TH levels normalized following resolution of sepsis symptoms. RESULTS: The patient exhibited markedly reduced T3 and fT3 levels with profoundly suppressed TSH and elevated rT3, consistent with NTIS rather than primary hypothyroidism. Transiently elevated fT4 may manifest in NTIS. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that when detecting reduced T3 with suppressed TSH in septic patients, clinicians should consider NTIS as a potential diagnosis. Measurement of rT3 and serial monitoring of TH levels are advised to avoid inappropriate therapeutic interventions."
41221745,A Rapid Method for Identification and Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Bacteria from Pediatric Blood Culture.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The prompt and accurate diagnosis of bloodstream infections are crucial. However, the routine conventional method of identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria from the positive blood culture typically takes several days. We aimed to develop a rapid method for bacterial identification and AST in bloodstream infections, with the goal of accelerating diagnosis and enabling earlier treatment. METHODS: Our rapid method based on the biochemistry of identification and the microdilution broth method of AST for bacteria isolated from pediatric positive blood culture bottles is highly efficient and time-saving. In this study, we included 80 positive blood culture samples from pediatric patients. The samples were processed by centrifugation with the gel tube and then divided into Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups. Identification and AST were performed using an automated culture antibiogram device based on biochemical methods and microdilution broth method. For routine processing, media inoculated with positive blood culture were kept in the incubator for about 20 hours. The discrepancies in identification and AST were compared between the rapid and routine methods. RESULTS: The results showed that 30 bacterial strains were categorized as Gram-positive and 50 as Gram-negative. The results showed a high level of agreement in identification, with 77 out of 80 samples (96.25%) showing concordant results between the rapid method and routine method. A total of 1,194 AST assays were performed. The rapid method demonstrated an essential agreement of 96.82% and a categorical agreement of 97.82%. Minor errors ratio, major errors ratio, and very major errors ratio were 1.17%, 0.84%, and 0.17%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid method holds potential for efficient and reliable identification and AST of bacteria from positive pediatric blood culture bottles."
