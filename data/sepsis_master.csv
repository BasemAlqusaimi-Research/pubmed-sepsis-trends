41676147,Role of cytokine levels in pathogen classification and prognosis of pediatric septic shock.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenic role of inflammatory cytokine levels in children with septic shock has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between the early concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, pathogen classification, and 28-day mortality in children with septic shock. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the early expression of cytokines in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary pediatric hospital due to septic shock between July 2019 and September 2024. RESULTS: A total of 189 children with septic shock were included and 68 died within 28 days of hospitalization. The plasma levels of IL-6 (P = 0.001), IL-10 (P < 0.001), IFN-gamma (P = 0.002), and TNF-alpha (P = 0.014) were significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the IL-6 level was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality after controlling platelet count and lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, Hb, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels. ROC analysis revealed the AUC values of the IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were 0.64, 0.68, 0.64 and 0.61, respectively, and that the optimal cutoff values were 414.92 pg/ml, 29.66 pg/ml, 1.605 pg/ml and 0.725 pg/ml, respectively. According to these cutoff values, the survival curves of the groups with high levels of IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha differed significantly from those with low levels (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). In children with positive fluid cultures, there was no statistically significant difference in cytokines levels between the gram-positive bacterial (G+) and gram-negative bacterial (G-) infection groups. However, in children with positive blood cultures, the levels of IL-6 (p = 0.005) and IL-10 (p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the G- group than in the G+ group. CONCLUSION: Elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels are valuable for predicting 28-day mortality and identifying gram-negative bacteremia in pediatric patients with septic shock. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha levels also have significant value for predicting 28-day mortality. Moreover, the IL-6 level was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality."
41676093,Early risk stratification of sepsis-related liver injury via machine learning: a multicohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-related liver injury (SRLI) is associated with poor prognosis and high morbidity in septic patients. Early mitigation of liver injury is crucial for improving outcomes in the critically ill. However, early detection and intervention remain challenging, due in part to the lack of effective diagnostic and screening strategies. This study aimed to apply machine learning (ML) approaches to identify significant predictors for the onset of SRLI, with the goal of facilitating early identification of high-risk patients. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, divided into training and internal validation cohorts. An additional external validation cohort consisted of 120 sepsis patients from Nanjing Jinling Hospital. We constructed seven ML models and two conventional assessment scales to predict the risk of SRLI in patients who did not meet the SRLI criteria within the first 24 h of ICU admission. The Boruta algorithm was employed for feature selection. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the training set using grid search. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC), along with specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F1 score. The clinical utility of the models was evaluated using decision curve analysis. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used to provide clinicians with an intuitive understanding of the machine learning model. RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 9,434 sepsis patients from MIMIC-IV were included for model development. The Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated superior overall predictive performance in internal validation, achieving an area under the curve of 0.867, precision-recall area under the curve of 0.392. Decision curve analysis indicated the RF model provided a positive net benefit across a wide range of high risk thresholds. In the RF model, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, sequential organ failure assessment, logistic organ dysfunction system, and prothrombin time were the most important indexes during the initial 24 hours following ICU admission, according to SHAP value. In the external validation, the RF model also outperformed all others (ROC-AUC: 0.862, PR-AUC: 0.735). CONCLUSION: Our study explored ML-based models for predicting SRLI among sepsis at an earlier stage and the performance of random forest model ranked best. The significant predictive contribution of prothrombin time highlights its potential as a key monitoring marker for early risk stratification in septic patients."
41676092,The endothelial activation and stress index as a predictor of 28-day mortality in pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective two-cohort analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) is an emerging biomarker that serves as a straightforward and objective measure of systemic endothelial dysfunction and critical illness severity. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of EASIX for 28-day mortality in patients with pulmonary sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study utilised a two-cohort design. The internal cohort was derived from MIMIC-IV; an external cohort was derived from a tertiary hospital (2022-2025). The association between the EASIX and 28-day mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. An ensemble machine-learning approach (Boruta, LASSO-COX, XGBoost, and SVM) was employed for feature selection. Significant predictors were incorporated into a multivariate Cox model to construct a prognostic nomogram. The model's discriminative performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC), and compared against conventional severity scores. RESULTS: A total of 5,416 patients were analyzed. In multivariable adjusted models, the EASIX emerged as an independent predictor of short term mortality. Each unit increase in EASIX was associated with a 7% higher risk of 28-day ICU death (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.11, p < 0.001). A clear dose-response relationship was observed across EASIX quartiles, with mortality rising from 13.29% (Q1) to 27.92% (Q4); patients in Q4 had nearly twice the mortality risk of those in Q1 (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.60-2.46). RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship. Machine-learning feature selection consistently identified EASIX as a core variable. The final prognostic model, integrating EASIX with five other clinical features, demonstrated stable and superior discriminative ability (AUC 0.67-0.73) compared to traditional severity scores in both internal and external validation. CONCLUSION: EASIX is a potent and independent predictor of short-term mortality in pulmonary sepsis. Its integration into a pragmatic prognostic model enhances early risk stratification, highlighting its potential as a readily available clinical tool."
41676054,Use of LVAD HeartMate 3 and Impella RP in the management of advanced heart failure in an elderly patient: a case report.,2026,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."
41675927,Analysis of prognostic risk factors and risk management measures for patients with ischemic stroke and bloodstream infection based on machine learning.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Through the machine learning Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, the system screened core prognostic risk factors for patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infection, constructed and validated a predictive model, provides a basis for formulating precise risk management strategies in clinical practice. METHODS: Clinical data from patients with bloodstream infections secondary to ischaemic stroke were retrospectively included. The dataset was randomly allocated into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Within the training set, Model 1 was constructed using traditional univariate and multivariate Cox regression methods, while Model 2 employed the machine learning LASSO regression algorithm. Models were compared using metrics including R-squared, C-index. The superior model was selected for validation on both training and validation sets using Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curves, and Decision-Making Curves (DCA). RESULTS: Model 2 was adopted as the final model, with a nomogram generated for the training set. As demonstrated by the nomogram, an increase in the total score was observed in patients with concomitant pneumonia, heart failure (HF), or coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD), in cases where mechanical ventilation (MV) was utilised, and in instances of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and C-reactive protein-lymphocyte ratio (CLR) values, and reduced albumin levels. In the training set, the AUC values for predicting 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day survival rates were 0.875, 0.886, and 0.861, respectively. The AUC value for the 28-day prognosis on the internal test set was 0.844, while that on the external validation dataset was 0.860. The model demonstrated high concordance between predicted and actual probabilities across three distinct cohorts. The clinical decision curve indicates that the model provides good net benefit within the 5%-25% range at all three time points (7,14,and 28 days) across the three datasets. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities such as pneumonia and hypoalbuminaemia constitute prognostic risk factors affecting patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infections. LASSO regression enables precise identification of these risk factors, yielding a prognostic prediction model with outstanding predictive efficacy and clinical utility. Clinicians may utilise model variables to implement targeted risk management strategies."
41674606,Rapid Detection of Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins in Neonatal Sepsis and Necrotizing Enterocolitis.,2026,"Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIP) are serine protease inhibitors and a reliable inflammatory biomarker. We have demonstrated that IAIP levels decrease during sepsis in humans and animal models. Currently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the standard procedure to measure IAIP levels. We developed a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that allows rapid, point of care detection. We compared IAIP levels in infants with sepsis and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by ELISA and LFIA in a multi-center, cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected from 47 infants with sepsis, 31 sepsis case controls, 52 gestational age (GA)-matched controls and 10 infants with culture-negative sepsis (""clinical sepsis""). We also collected samples from 17 infants with NEC, 7 NEC case controls and 15 GA controls. IAIP levels at presentation of acute events and over the next 72 hours were significantly reduced in infants with sepsis, NEC and culture negative sepsis when compared to controls. IAIP levels did not differ in patients with sepsis or culture negative sepsis. IAIP levels measured by ELISA and LFIA were highly correlated (R (2) = 0.9326) and both showed reliable detection of neonatal sepsis, NEC and culture negative sepsis. IAIP levels were 80.0% sensitive and 92.3% specific using LFIA for the detection of neonatal sepsis. For detection of NEC, IAIP levels were 84.6% sensitive and 86.7% specific."
41674120,Interpreting peripheral oxygen saturation variability in critical illness: A directional framework adjusted for hypoxia severity.,2026,"Peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) exhibits a complex pattern of fluctuations during hypoxia, which can be quantified using entropy measures. SpO2 entropy analysis provides insights into dynamic physiological regulation by non-invasively reflecting the body's capacity to adapt to internal or external physiological challenges. However, the interpretation of SpO2 entropy alone is limited without contextualisation and the degree of physiological challenge encountered (e.g. the severity of hypoxia). This proof-of-concept retrospective study analysed continuous 1 Hz SpO2 recordings extracted from MIMIC-III dataset's Intensive Care Unit ICU patients with sepsis (n = 164), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 58), acute liver failure (ALF) (n = 59), or cirrhosis (n = 169). Sample entropy was computed directly from raw 20-min SpO2 signals and normalised to mean SpO2 using directional parenclitic deviation (delta), derived from a healthy hypoxia-exposure reference dataset. Cox-regression models assessed 30-day ICU mortality. In sepsis, delta was significantly higher in non-survivors (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.20, P < 0.0001) and independently predicted 30-day mortality (HR = 1.79, P < 0.0001). delta was not predictive in the COPD, ALF and cirrhosis cohorts. Unlike other patient groups, the cirrhosis group demonstrated unexpected mean negative delta values, suggesting aberrant regulatory engagement, potentially related to the pathophysiology of hepatopulmonary syndrome. These findings demonstrate that delta provides physiological contexts to entropy-based SpO2 analysis. By linking variability to the severity of hypoxia, this framework enables a more interpretable and a potentially clinically applicable biomarker of systemic regulation in critical illnesses. Future validation across diverse cohorts could support its potential to aid in personalised care within intensive care settings."
41672594,"Phase 1 open-label study of ASP9801, an oncolytic virus, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.",2026,"PURPOSE: ASP9801, an oncolytic virus encoding interleukin-7 and interleukin-12, was assessed for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors in a Phase 1 study. METHODS: The study comprised Part 1 ASP9801 monotherapy dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion with ASP9801 monotherapy or plus pembrolizumab. Each part was divided into Groups A (ASP9801 injection into cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions) and B (ASP9801 injection into visceral lesions). Primary objectives were safety and maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 dose expansion (RP2D); secondary objectives included antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: In dose escalation, 17 and 10 patients in Groups A and B, respectively, received treatment. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; grade 3 cytokine release syndrome) was reported in Group A. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in >/=30% of patients in Group A were pyrexia and in Group B were pyrexia, chills, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and headache. AEs leading to death occurred in two patients in Group A (one each for malignant neoplasm progression and sepsis); neither was attributed to ASP9801. The RP2D of ASP9801 was 5x10(8) plaque-forming unit/mL. In Part 2 dose expansion Group A, 12 patients received monotherapy RP2D, 5 received monotherapy induction, and 2 received ASP9801 plus pembrolizumab. In Group B, 9 and 11 patients received ASP9801 monotherapy or plus pembrolizumab, respectively. One DLT occurred in Group B combination safety cohort (grade 2 pyrexia and mental status change; grade 3 hypoxia, lymphopenia, and pneumonitis). During dose expansion, TRAEs in >/=30% of any cohort (>1 patient) in Group A were nausea, fatigue, chills, pyrexia, and headache and in Group B were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, chills, pyrexia, and lymphocyte count decreased. AEs led to death in two patients in Group A monotherapy and one patient in Group B monotherapy cohorts, all due to malignant neoplasm progression; none were attributed to ASP9801. One patient in Group B combination safety cohort achieved confirmed partial response (objective response rate, 9.1% (95% CI 0.3% to 52.7%)). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ASP9801 alone or plus pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated; however, the study was stopped due to lack of efficacy during dose expansion."
41670654,Procalcitonin kinetics in critically ill children: impact of continuous kidney replacement therapy modality and dose.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill children, frequently necessitating continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT). Procalcitonin (PCT) is widely used as an infection biomarker, yet its interpretation during CKRT remains unclear. Adult data regarding extracorporeal clearance of PCT are inconsistent, while pediatric evidence is limited. METHODS: In this prospective observational study (May 2021-October 2023), 40 critically ill children receiving CKRT in a tertiary PICU were enrolled. Serum PCT was measured at CKRT initiation (T0), 12 h (T12), and 24 h (T24). CKRT modalities (CVVH, CVVHD, CVVHDF), effluent doses, and membrane types (PS, PAES, AN69-ST) were recorded. PCT kinetics were analyzed using non-parametric tests, with correlation assessed by Spearman's rank. RESULTS: Median baseline PCT was 3.6 ng/mL (IQR 0.5-27.2), rising to 7.4 (0.6-29.5) at T12 and stabilizing at 7.7 (0.6-30.5) at T24. Differences across time points were not statistically significant (p = 0.68). PCT trajectories were unaffected by CKRT modality, effluent dose, or membrane type, and no correlation was found between effluent dose and PCT changes. Stratification by high versus low effluent dosing revealed no significant differences. CKRT-related complications occurred in 17.5%, mainly filter clotting, without influencing PCT. PICU mortality was 35%, reflecting illness severity rather than CKRT. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CKRT, short-term PCT dynamics are driven by the underlying septic or inflammatory process rather than CKRT parameters. PCT typically peaks within 12 h of CKRT initiation and then stabilizes, supporting its reliability for infection monitoring and antibiotic stewardship during early CKRT. Larger studies are warranted to define long-term PCT behavior and prognostic utility."
41669529,Intestinal microenvironment dynamics and Sepsis-associated encephalopathy pathophysiology: insights from multi-omics profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a devastating complication of sepsis, lacks specific biomarkers and clear pathophysiological understanding, particularly regarding the gut-brain axis. While gut dysbiosis is implicated in SAE, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (16S rDNA and fecal miRNA sequencing) to dissect the gut microenvironment in SAE patients (n = 10) compared to sepsis patients without encephalopathy (SP, n = 20). RESULTS: Although alpha- and beta-diversity indices showed no significant differences, distinct compositional shifts in the gut microbiota were observed in SAE patients, characterized by increased abundance of Neisseria, Haemophilus, Lautropia, Enterococcus, Parabacteroides, and decreased Fusobacterium, Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, among others. Concurrently, 12 fecal miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in SAE, with 11 upregulated (e.g., miR-106a-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-30e-3p) and 1 downregulated (miR-222-3p). Crucially, correlation network analysis revealed significant interactions between 10 DE miRNAs and 15 bacterial genera, establishing a complex gut microbiota-miRNA interplay in SAE. Machine learning (LASSO and elastic net regression) identified miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as the most promising combined diagnostic biomarkers, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893. Functional exploration via ceRNA network analysis indicated miR-30e-3p targets inflammation and apoptosis-related genes (e.g., IL1B, RPS6KB1, AKT1), while miR-223-5p primarily targets immune-regulatory genes (e.g., IGF1, AR). Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated serum IL-1beta levels in SAE patients (p < 0.001), supporting the predicted inflammatory pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of a fecal miRNA-gut microbiota interaction network in SAE pathogenesis, highlighting miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as pivotal mediators and potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets."
41669126,"Evaluation of procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in children in Owerri, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Timely diagnosis remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional blood culture. This study evaluates procalcitonin as a biomarker for bacterial sepsis in children aged 0-59 months in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2023 and February 2024. It involved 298 children aged 0-59 months with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) who were admitted to the Emergency Pediatric Unit and Special Care Baby Unit of Federal Teaching Hospital, Owerri. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured using ELISA, and blood cultures were processed using the BacT/Alert system. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of procalcitonin were compared against blood culture results. RESULTS: Of the 298 children, 142 (47.7%) had culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of serum procalcitonin were 66.9%, 89.7%, 85.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for serum procalcitonin was 0.80 across all age groups which were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin has a good diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial sepsis in children and can complement blood culture in resource-limited settings. Further studies are recommended to explore its application in routine clinical practice."
41668768,Role of DNA methylation in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression in neonates with late-onset sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major health issue, particularly in resource-poor areas. This study aimed to assess the role of DNA methylation in regulating the inflammatory cytokine expression in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing neonates with LOS (n=42) before and after 72 hours of antibiotic treatment (n=25) to healthy controls (HC) (n=42). We analysed DNA methylation patterns and inflammatory cytokine expression levels in both groups. RESULTS: DNA methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation in pro-inflammatory genes and hypermethylation in anti-inflammatory genes in LOS neonates. These patterns were shifted in follow-up group, with significant changes in inflammatory marker levels, including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta. The gene expression results aligned with the DNA methylation findings, indicating that changes in the expression of inflammatory genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) are influenced by DNA methylation. The results were further validated through an analysis of plasma cytokine levels. LOS cases showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, except IL-10. In the follow-up group, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Understanding these molecular changes could lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing neonatal sepsis."
41668763,Mechanistic and therapeutic dimensions of DcR3-mediated immunomodulation in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host-immune responses, progressing through hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive stages. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a soluble member of the TNF receptor superfamily, serves as an immunomodulator in sepsis. Beyond neutralizing FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A to block apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, DcR3 regulates macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and immune cell survival through its heparan sulfate proteoglycan-binding domain. Evidence from cellular, molecular, and animal studies highlights its dual role in restoring immune balance by modulating both hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases of sepsis. In this review, we summarize current evidence on DcR3 in sepsis and discuss translational challenges and future directions. Current rodent models lacking the TNFRSF6B gene are limited; however, transgenic mice expressing human DcR3 exhibit both protective and detrimental context-dependent effects. Translational challenges include the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of recombinant DcR3, although strategies such as PEGylation, nanoparticle encapsulation, and hydrogel delivery may improve its efficacy. Combining DcR3 with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or immunometabolic agents like metformin and dimethyl itaconate presents promising therapeutic potential. Future research will focus on CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in mouse models, multi-omics mapping of DcR3 signaling, and biomarker-guided dosing. Although no DcR3-targeted clinical trials in sepsis have been conducted, DcR3 remains a precision-targeted immunotherapy with mechanistic and translational pathways; this review delineates key knowledge gaps that must be addressed to enable future clinical application."
41668730,Exploring the association between dexmedetomidine and all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis through propensity score matching analysis and machine learning algorithms: a MIMIC-IV retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis carries high ICU mortality globally, often requiring sedated mechanical ventilation. While some studies suggest dexmedetomidine improves survival in these patients, others contradict this finding. This study evaluates dexmedetomidine's survival benefit and sedation value for ventilated sepsis cases. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database and eICU-CRD to analyze mechanically ventilated septic patients. Propensity score matching was employed to balance covariates. Machine learning algorithms were applied to validate dexmedetomidine's role in predicting mortality. RESULTS: A propensity score matching analysis was performed for 5176 pairs of patients. The use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (13.39% vs. 19.84%, HR: 0.595, P < 0.001) and of 180-day all-cause mortality (17.45% vs. 23.18%, HR: 0.632, P < 0.001). However, dexmedetomidine use was also associated with longer hospital (median 15.08 days vs. 10.2 days, P < 0.001) and ICU stays (median 6.81 days vs. 4.0 days, P < 0.001). Moreover, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in the dexmedetomidine group (median 78 h vs. 51.00 h, P < 0.001). Dexmedetomidine was included among the significant features identified with the Boruta algorithm, and of the five machine learning models built using the 20 most important features (including dexmedetomidine), the model constructed on the basis of the Random Forest algorithm performed the best (training set: AUC = 0.781; test set: AUC = 0.811; eICU-CRD set: AUC = 0.820). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that comorbid acute kidney injury (AKI) was the most important predictor of mortality among mechanically ventilated septic patients. This was followed by the use of opioids, PaO(2), and the SOFA score, with the use of dexmedetomidine relatively closely behind. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine use significantly reduces short-term mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis but prolongs the hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and duration of mechanical ventilation. Administering dexmedetomidine within 48 hours and maintaining an infusion rate at or below 0.6 mug/kg/h appears to be more beneficial. Moreover, dexmedetomidine use strongly influences mortality in these patients."
41667115,Practical machine learning model for early and accurate prediction of disseminated intravascular coagulation before its progression to an overt stage.,2026,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In patients with sepsis, anticoagulant therapy is expected to have maximal efficacy when administered before the development of sepsis-induced overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This therapeutic strategy requires a valid method for real-time, early prediction of sepsis-induced DIC, which is likely to progress to an overt stage. We aimed to develop machine learning prediction models for overt DIC, based on the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria, using a large-scale electronic medical record database. METHODS: This multi-center retrospective, observational study included adult patients with sepsis without overt DIC at day 1. The outcome was development of overt DIC 24 h after a certain time point. Predictive features were baseline data and time series data within 7 days post-admission. We constructed three separate models (minimum, compact, and full models), each incorporating increasingly comprehensive sets of features. Prediction models were constructed with machine learning algorithms, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and evaluated on a randomly selected 20% test set. RESULTS: Among 7,532 patients with sepsis, 766 developed overt DIC within 7 days. XGBoost and GBM achieved the highest prediction accuracy. The full, compact, and minimum models on the test set, exhibited area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.916, 0.884, and 0.851, respectively. The full XGBoost model achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.295; at 80% recall, its precision was 14.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model exhibited high accuracy in predicting overt DIC at a clinically reliable level."
41666174,Integrated microbiomics and metabolomics analysis reveals distinct profiles in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli infections in Pancreatitis-associated sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatitis-associated sepsis (PAS) caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria poses significant clinical challenges. The objective of this research was to examine the microbial and metabolic profiles of individuals with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Escherichia coli (CREC) infections using integrated microbiomics and metabolomics approaches. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 11 PAS patients (8 CRAB, 3 CREC) were analyzed using 16S rDNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics via LC-MS. Microbial diversity, community structure, and differential metabolites were examined between CRAB and CREC groups. RESULTS: CRAB patients exhibited higher microbial diversity compared to CREC patients. p-Proteobacteria, p-Firmicutes, and p-Cyanobacteria predominated in both patient groups. Significant differences in microbial composition were observed, with p-Proteobacteria more abundant in CRAB and p-Cyanobacteria in CREC samples. g-Enhydrobacter and s-Moraxella osloensis were the biomarkers, significantly higher in CREC patients. Metabolomic analysis revealed 328 differential metabolites between groups, with the majority being downregulated in CRAB. The main categories of identified differential metabolites were amino acids and their derivatives. These differential metabolites were closely related to various metabolic pathways. The most significant metabolic difference between the two patient groups was the level of triglycerides. R-2 Methanandamide and 13-(beta-D-glucosyloxy) docosanoic acid showed the highest correlation with g-Enhydrobacter and s-Moraxella osloensis. CONCLUSION: In PAS patients, s-Moraxella osloensis is a biomarker distinguishing CRAB and CREC infections, correlating with R-2 Methanandamide and 13-(beta-D-glucosyloxy) docosanoic acid."
41664723,Strategies for Embedding Prediction Models in Clinical Decision‑Making Workflows.,2026,"Machine learning and statistical prediction tools proliferate across healthcare, yet the leap from development to sustained clinical impact remains elusive. This narrative review synthesizes empirical evidence on how prediction models have been embedded into routine decision‑making and what lessons can be drawn for implementation teams. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and specialized informatics journals (2010-2025) identified studies describing the real-world deployment of multivariable prediction models and reporting implementation outcomes. Evidence centered on sepsis detection, deterioration, readmission, and emergency triage models. Embedding strategies ranged from interruptive pop‑ups and non‑interruptive dashboard displays to worklists and order‑set linkage. Successful deployments invested heavily in stakeholder co‑design, threshold selection, training, and performance monitoring. Comparative studies indicated that deployment of a deep‑learning sepsis model (COMPOSER (COnformal Multidimensional Prediction Of SEpsis Risk)) decreased in‑hospital mortality and improved guideline adherence relative to baseline. Major barriers included workflow misalignment, alert fatigue, lack of transparency, data quality issues, and insufficient governance structures. Few papers described ongoing monitoring. The evidence suggests that prediction models confer value only when embedded through carefully designed clinical decision support aligned with the ""Five Rights"" framework, supported by multidisciplinary governance and rigorous monitoring. Implementation teams should prioritize calibration and decision utility metrics over discrimination alone, establish model‑life‑cycle governance, and integrate clinician training to build trust."
41664216,Long non-coding RNAs as key regulators in sepsis: from immune response to organ dysfunction.,2026,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units worldwide, driven by a dysregulated host response to infection that culminates in multi-organ dysfunction. Current diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies lack the needed sensitivity, specificity and efficacy, underscoring an urgent need for novel molecular insights. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a diverse class of transcripts exceeding 200 nucleotides without protein-coding capacity, have emerged as pivotal regulators of sepsis pathophysiology. They orchestrate immune responses, inflammatory cascades, cellular apoptosis, metabolic reprogramming and the lethal cross-talk among diverse cell death pathways. Through intricate interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs also drive organ-specific injury via distinct cell-type specific mechanisms. Specific lncRNAs, including NEAT1, MALAT1 and GAS5, are deeply implicated in disease onset, progression and prognosis, highlighting their potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this review, we synthesize current evidence on the roles of lncRNAs in immune modulation, organ dysfunction and metabolic regulation during sepsis. We also evaluate their promise in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, and discuss major translational barriers, such as physicochemical instability, poor permeability and disease heterogeneity, that must be overcome for clinical application. A deeper understanding of these molecules may unlock novel strategies for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of sepsis."
41663846,Plasma metabolomic signatures in patients with multidrug-resistant bacterial sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are a leading cause of sepsis-related death. A rapid method to identify patients with MDR infections upon hospital admission is urgently needed. This study aimed to characterize the distinct plasma metabolomic signatures associated with MDR gram-positive (G+) and gram-negative (G-) sepsis and to develop predictive models for rapid, risk stratification during the initial clinical encounter. METHODS: Two independent cohorts of septic patients were recruited, with 198 subjects (117 MDR and 81 susceptible) in the discovery cohort, and 198 patients (95 MDR and 103 susceptible) in the validation cohort. Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multiple machine learning algorithms were employed to identify differential metabolomic signatures and to construct and validate multi-metabolite models for the early identification of MDR bacteria. RESULTS: Distinct metabolomic signatures were identified for both MDR G- and G+ infections. MDR G- sepsis showed significant elevations in metabolites related to host inflammatory responses, such as histamine, alongside decreased levels of gut microbiota-derived metabolites, including cholic acid and benzoic acid, indicating profound host-microbe dysregulation. Conversely, MDR G+ sepsis was characterized by alterations in energy and amino acid metabolism, notably elevated 2-hydroxyglutarate, a marker of mitochondrial stress. An 8-metabolite model for MDR G- infection achieved excellent discrimination in both the discovery (AUROC = 0.885, 95% CI: 0.787-0.982) and validation (AUROC = 0.878, 95% CI: 0.782-0.951) cohorts. The model for MDR G+ infection demonstrated good predictive performance (AUROC = 0.763 and 0.715 in discovery and validation, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study identifies robust and distinct plasma metabolomic signatures that differentiate MDR from antibiotic-susceptible sepsis. These findings support the development of rapid, metabolomics-based testing using admission plasma to risk-stratify patients. This approach could guide early, stewardship-aligned antimicrobial decisions while conventional culture results are pending, potentially improving clinical outcomes."
41663647,Time stability of Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS) as a cellular hematology biomarker for infection in critically ill patients.,2026,"The Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS) is composed of blood-cell derived parameters to discriminate infection or sepsis from non-infectious inflammatory responses. The study examines the stability of the complete blood count (CBC) and ICIS after blood sample storage at room temperature (RT) and determines the impact of potential variations on ICIS and its clinical interpretation. In total, 53 K3-EDTA-blood samples collected from critically ill patients were analyzed at baseline (t(0)) and after 8 h (t(1)) on a hematology analyzer. After a mean storage time of 514 min at RT, all ICIS parameters in the CBC are stable. Observed transitions of ICIS classification were neither statistically (p = 0.082) nor clinically relevant as no sample was classified as falsely positive or falsely negative. This study demonstrates the stability of the ICIS in K3-EDTA whole blood for up to 8 h at RT, preserving its clinical interpretation and utility in distinguishing infection from non-infectious inflammatory responses, even if analysis is delayed. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-026-37204-8."
41662361,Decoding hypervirulence in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae: genomic and phenotypic profiling reveals capsular polysaccharide as a key driver of pathogenicity.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The global dissemination of hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (hv-CRKP) poses escalating threats to public health. Substantial controversy persists regarding its true virulence potential, highlighting the need for reliable biomarkers to enable early diagnosis and targeted therapy. METHODS: Using a mouse subcutaneous challenge model, we characterized 59 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates, identifying 37.29% (22/59) as convergent hv-CRKP. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization, integrated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptomic analysis, was performed, and reliable biomarkers for accurate hv-CRKP detection were identified. RESULTS: Patients infected with hv-CRKP exhibited significantly higher sepsis incidence (P = 0.028) and increased mortality. Capsule production and hypermucoviscosity robustly discriminated hv-CRKP from CRKP. GWAS identified a significant association between an SNP in the rbtT locus and the hypervirulent phenotype, whereas virulence plasmid-associated genes showed no significant association. These findings suggest chromosomally encoded factors-independent of plasmid-borne elements-contribute critically to hypervirulence. Transcriptomics revealed rcsA-mediated capsule upregulation enhances macrophage phagocytosis resistance and bacterial survival, revealing a pivotal pathogenic mechanism. Both multivariable logistic regression and LASSO regression confirmed capsule production and rcsA expression as independent and robust diagnostic biomarkers to accurately assess virulence potential in carbapenem-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that clinical application of the term ""hv-CRKP"" requires prudent validation and emphasize the urgency of developing biomarkers to precisely identify truly hypervirulent CRKP strains."
41661189,Artificial intelligence-driven predictive analytics for postoperative management and recovery in trauma patients.,2026,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Post-traumatic care is evolving from a reactive, protocol-driven paradigm to a predictive, personalized approach. This review examines how artificial intelligence and machine learning are redefining postoperative management by predicting complications before they manifest. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature (2023-2025) highlights three major advances: (a) the validation of gradient boosting algorithms (e.g. Extreme Gradient Boosting) that significantly outperform traditional scoring systems for predicting trauma-induced coagulopathy; (b) the development of interpretable, phenotype-specific models for venous thromboembolism risk stratification, particularly in traumatic brain injury; and (c) the emergence of real-time sepsis prediction tools that account for the sterile inflammation inherent to trauma. However, a recurring limitation in current research is the reliance on retrospective datasets and single-center validations, underscoring the critical need for rigorous external validation across diverse patient populations before widespread clinical adoption. SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence is not merely a monitoring tool but a driver of precision medicine in trauma. By leveraging diverse modalities, from computer vision in radiology to natural language processing in electronic health records, clinicians can now anticipate adverse events. To bridge the gap between algorithm and bedside, future efforts must focus on overcoming significant implementation barriers, such as data interoperability, and ensuring model generalizability."
41661178,Risk Factors for Invasive Infection in Febrile Oncology Patients Related to Cancer Type.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and laboratory risk factors for invasive infection in febrile oncology patients seen in the Pediatric Emergency Department, depending on the type of cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of febrile oncology patients seen between 2016 and 2023 at the Pediatric Emergency Department of a tertiary teaching hospital. Invasive infection was defined microbiologically (isolation of a bacterial pathogen in sterile fluid or a commensal bacterial species in 2 different blood cultures) or clinically (death, meeting Phoenix criteria for sepsis, receiving inotropic support, or developing acute complications or sequelae). We performed separate multivariate analyses for hematologic cancers and solid tumors. Hematologic cancers were further classified considering the myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy received. We classified the following as high-risk hematologic cancers: acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the induction, reinduction, or consolidation phase or relapse, and acute myeloid leukemia in any phase. RESULTS: We included 471 episodes: 306 hematologic cancers and 165 solid tumors. The median age was 4 years (interquartile range: 2 to 10) and the median duration of fever was 2 hours (interquartile range: 1 to 3). Invasive infections were diagnosed in 69 cases (14.6%). The rate was higher among patients with high-risk hematologic cancers (n=45, 23.2%), than among those with solid tumors (n=18, 10.9%; P=0.002) or with low-risk hematologic cancers (n=6, 5.4%; P<0.001). Among patients with hematological cancers, presenting a high-risk cancer (OR: 6.006; 95% CI: 2.459-18.200) and elevated procalcitonin levels (OR: 1.668; 95% CI: 1.205-2.571) were predictors of invasive infection [AUC for the model: 0.718 (95% CI: 0.640-0.795)]. Only age (OR: 1.145; 95% CI: 1.036-1.267) was found to be an independent risk factor in patients with solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematologic cancers and very recent onset fever, the type of cancer and procalcitonin level are useful for predicting the risk of invasive infection."
41660872,"Mortality prediction in geriatric ICU patients with pneumonia-related sepsis: APACHE II, NEWS, and serum lactate.",2026,"Sepsis secondary to pneumonia is a prominent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality among older adults, yet early bedside risk stratification poses significant challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), both individually and in combination, alongside admission serum lactate levels, for predicting mortality in geriatric ICU patients with pneumonia-related sepsis. In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we analyzed patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted between January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2025. Sepsis was defined according to Sepsis-3 criteria; APACHE II (using the worst values within the first 24 hours) and NEWS (measured at ICU admission) were recorded, along with the first lactate and other biomarkers obtained within the first 24 hours. We assessed mortality predictors using logistic regression and evaluated model discrimination through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Among the 179 patients (median age 80), the ICU mortality rate was 64.8%. Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher APACHE II and NEWS scores, as well as elevated lactate and inflammatory markers (all p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, APACHE II (OR 1.130; p<0.001), NEWS (OR 1.239; p=0.003), and a history of stroke (OR 2.856; p=0.041) were identified as independent predictors of mortality, whereas lactate did not demonstrate independent predictive capability. Although lactate improved the discrimination of a baseline clinical-laboratory model (AUC increased from 0.67 to 0.75), it offered no incremental benefit when APACHE II and NEWS were included; the combined APACHE II+NEWS model achieved the highest AUC of 0.85. Exploratory cut-offs identified very high-risk subgroups (APACHE II >21 with NEWS >8 or lactate >2 mmol/L), with mortality rates approximating 86-87%. In conclusion, APACHE II and NEWS are robust early predictors of mortality in geriatric patients with pneumonia-related sepsis, while lactate may assist in early risk stratification but provides limited prognostic value beyond these scoring systems."
41660626,GDF15 orchestrates mitochondrial-immune crosstalk via SMAD7-HIF-1alpha-PKM2 cascade to attenuate septic liver injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure involves pathological crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperinflammation, yet endogenous protective mechanisms remain incompletely defined. This study investigates Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) as a potential regulator of sepsis tolerance. METHODS: Using LPS-challenged mouse endotoxemia and a murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell line model, we assessed GDF15's functional role through: (1) recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 8 (rAAV8)-mediated tissue-specific overexpression, (2) siRNA knockdown, (3) pharmacological modulation (BAY 87-2243/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) inhibitor, Shikonin/PKM2 inhibitor, Asiaticoside/SMAD7 activator), and (4) comprehensive metabolic-inflammatory phenotyping including mitochondrial complex integrity (assessed via UQCRC1, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Core Protein 1), cytokine dynamics (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and lactate metabolism. RESULTS: LPS challenge induced time-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction concurrent with cytokine storms and compensatory GDF15 upregulation in both liver and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific GDF15 overexpression attenuated injury through restored mitochondrial integrity, diminished macrophage infiltration, and reduced systemic inflammation, as evidenced by significantly lower levels of circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6. Mechanistically, GDF15 preserved mitochondrial homeostasis by inducing SMAD7 expression while suppressing HIF-1alpha accumulation and PKM2 nuclear translocation. Pharmacological HIF-1alpha/PKM2 inhibition recapitulated GDF15's protective effects, restoring mitochondrial function and reducing inflammation even in GDF15-deficient models. Clinical analysis of a sepsis patient cohort (n=119) confirmed a significant elevation of circulating GDF15, with its levels strongly correlating with disease severity scores. Critically, SMAD7 activation attenuated HIF-1alpha accumulation and rescued mitochondrial failure independently of GDF15 status. CONCLUSION: GDF15 orchestrates sepsis tolerance through the SMAD7-HIF-1alpha axis, preserving mitochondrial integrity while resolving metabolic-inflammatory dysregulation, notably by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. This study identifies GDF15 as a central guardian of mitochondrial-immune homeostasis in sepsis, positioning it as both a robust severity biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for mitochondrial resuscitation."
41657733,S100A12 drives inflammatory and metabolic reprogramming in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2026,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe complication of sepsis characterized by dysregulated inflammation, endothelial injury, and metabolic reprogramming. Among the numerous inflammatory mediators involved, S100 calcium-binding protein A12 (S100A12), a neutrophil-derived alarmin, has emerged as a key amplifier of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in this context. Through activation of these pathways, S100A12 drives inflammatory amplification, promotes cytokine release, pyroptotic and apoptotic cell death, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired tubular repair, thereby exacerbating renal injury. Experimental studies demonstrate that inhibition of S100A12 or blockade of its downstream signaling attenuates inflammation and tissue damage, whereas clinical evidence associates elevated circulating and urinary S100A12 levels with disease severity and adverse prognosis in sepsis. Collectively, current evidence positions S100A12 as both a mechanistic driver of inflammatory and metabolic reprogramming and a clinically actionable biomarker in SA-AKI. This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular biology and immunometabolic roles of S100A12 in SA-AKI, emphasizes its systemic versus kidney-specific effects, and discusses its translational potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, highlighting opportunities and challenges for precision diagnostics and targeted therapies in sepsis-related organ injury."
41657488,Assessment of Serum Interleukins 18 and 22 in Predicting Neonatal Sepsis and Mortality: A Case-Control Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its early diagnosis remains challenging. Neonatal sepsis (NS) induces an immune response with the release of Inflammatory cytokines, which may serve as early diagnostic biomarkers. Limited data indicate interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-22 levels are elevated in NS and associated with mortality. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic performance of serum IL-18 and IL-22 levels in predicting NS and mortality. DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: We enrolled 55 newborns with culture-positive sepsis and 34 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Serum IL-18 and IL-22 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of IL-18 and IL-22 in predicting NS and mortality. RESULTS: Compared with controls, newborns with NS had significantly higher median levels of IL-18 (910 vs 256 pg/mL, P < .001) and IL-22 (96 vs 20 pg/mL, P < .001). Among septic neonates, non-survivors had significantly higher median levels of IL-18 (1820 vs 873 pg/mL, P < .001) and IL-22 (139 vs 91 pg/mL, P < .001) than survivors. ROC curve analysis demonstrated excellent performance of IL-18 and IL-22 in predicting NS (area under the curve [AUC] 0.990 and 0.998, respectively) and mortality (AUC 0.942 and 0.994, respectively). CONCLUSION: IL-18 and IL-22 are potentially promising biomarkers for identifying NS and predicting neonatal mortality."
41657086,Changes in serum SAA and PCT levels in patients with sepsis associated acute kidney injury and their relationship with renal function outcomes.,2026,"AIM: To investigate the dynamics of serum amyloid A (SAA) and procalcitonin (PCT) in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI) and to evaluate their prognostic value for renal outcomes. METHODS: 159 Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) patients with SAKI were enrolled. Serum SAA and PCT levels were measured on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after enrollment. Patients were stratified by 28d renal recovery status. Associations with renal outcomes and predictive performance were examined using Pearson correlation, multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Non-recovery was associated with higher baseline levels of SAA, PCT, lactate, serum creatinine, and APACHE II scores (all p < 0.05). Both biomarkers declined progressively, reaching their lowest levels by day 7. Baseline SAA and PCT showed strong negative correlations with 28d eGFR (r = -0.414, -0.491; p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression identified APACHE II score (OR = 1.260), SAA (OR = 1.025), and PCT (OR = 1.275) as independent predictors of non-recovery. ROC curve analysis demonstrated good discriminative ability, with AUCs of 0.813 for SAA, 0.819 for PCT, and 0.827 for APACHE II (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SAA and PCT are robust short-term predictors of renal outcomes in sepsis-associated AKI. Their dynamic trajectories reflect disease severity and treatment response."
41655519,S-S.M.A.R.T score for mortality prediction in sepsis: Comparative analysis with qSOFA and a novel SSMART-MC model.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Early risk stratification in sepsis is essential for guiding timely clinical decisions in the emergency department (ED). While several prognostic scores exist, many rely on laboratory parameters that may not be immediately available at triage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic performance of the S-S.M.A.R.T score for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with Sepsis-3-defined sepsis and to assess whether incorporating comorbidity and biomarker data enhances predictive accuracy. METHODS: This prospective observational study included adult patients (>/=18 years) presenting to a ED with sepsis defined by Sepsis-3 criteria. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at ED presentation. The S-S.M.A.R.T score, SOFA score, and a novel SSMART-MC model (S-S.M.A.R.T plus malignancy and CRP) were calculated. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Prognostic performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. RESULTS: Among 180 patients, 104 (57.8%) died within 30 days. Median S-S.M.A.R.T and SOFA scores were higher in non-survivors (3 vs. 2 and 9 vs. 6; p < .001). S-S.M.A.R.T predicted 30-day mortality with an AUC of 0.718, similar to SOFA (AUC 0.735; p = .701). Incorporating malignancy and CRP, the SSMART-MC model achieved an AUC of 0.867, with 87.3% sensitivity, 72.0% specificity, and 80.8% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In this Sepsis-3 cohort, the S-S.M.A.R.T score showed performance comparable to qSOFA for predicting 30-day mortality. The incorporation of malignancy and CRP appeared to improve prognostic accuracy. However, given the limited sample size and lack of external validation, the SSMART-MC model should be considered a promising tool that requires confirmation in larger, multicenter studies before routine clinical use."
41654983,Artificial intelligence in emergency surgery: a scoping review within the artificial intelligence in emergency and trauma surgery (ARIES) project.,2026,"AIM: To map and critically appraise the current literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in emergency general surgery, with a focus on clinical decision-support tools for preoperative risk stratification and intraoperative assistance, and to identify ethical, structural, and regulatory barriers to implementation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted within the ARIES project, following established methodological frameworks. Relevant studies evaluating AI-based tools in emergency surgical settings were systematically identified and analyzed. RESULTS: The literature describes AI applications mainly in two domains: preoperative decision support, including risk prediction and diagnostic or triage models for acute abdominal and traumatic conditions, and intraoperative assistance, largely focused on computer vision-based systems for anatomical recognition, safety guidance, and navigation in minimally invasive emergency procedures. Additional contributions address training and telementoring platforms, as well as cross-cutting ethical, legal, and regulatory considerations relevant to AI adoption in emergency surgical care. CONCLUSIONS: AI has the potential to complement emergency surgeons' clinical judgment, but its routine adoption in emergency surgical practice remains limited. Addressing methodological, ethical, and regulatory challenges, together with the development of robust data infrastructures and targeted training pathways, is essential to support safe, effective, and equitable implementation in acute care settings. In addition, the lack of dedicated investment and sustainable funding models for large-scale clinical implementation and prospective evaluation represents a critical barrier to the translation of AI from research into routine emergency surgical practice."
41651602,Microcirculatory Dysfunction in Sepsis.,2026,"Microcirculatory dysfunction plays a central role in sepsis pathophysiology and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. While advances in bedside tools and biomarkers offer potential for identifying microcirculatory dysfunction, most therapies targeting the microcirculation have not translated into improved clinical outcomes. Future advances likely lie in precision medicine approaches that employ microcirculatory measurements to guide individualized resuscitation strategies. This article highlights current evidence on the physiology, assessment, and therapeutic approaches to microvascular dysfunction in sepsis, underscoring the need for precision medicine strategies and further research into patient subgroups that may benefit from microcirculation directed interventions."
41651601,Immunology of Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis-related immune dysregulation occurs in three overlapping phases, including pathogen recognition, inflammation, and immune paralysis. There are many immune cells that underlie these three phases, with the most well-studied being epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. These cells regulate multiple downstream mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, that can be measured and used as immunologic biomarkers. Past failures in sepsis immune-modulating treatment trials have likely resulted from the inclusion of patients meeting sepsis clinical criteria but who do not sufficiently express the immunologic target under investigation. More precise approaches to trial designs may uncover effective immune-modulating therapies."
41651304,HO-1/Nrf2 activation orchestrates protection in sepsis-induced lung injury by suppressing CCR2(hi) monocyte recruitment and MAPK-driven inflammation.,2026,"Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains a devastatingly lethal clinical syndrome driven by aberrant inflammatory dysregulation, wherein monocytes play critical roles in disease pathogenesis. This study elucidates the mechanistic basis by which the HO-1 inducer Hemin alleviates ALI by activating the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway to target pro-inflammatory monocytes. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the most prominently dysregulated genes in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 monocytes (relative to untreated controls) were predominantly enriched in pathways governing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. In vitro experiments revealed that Hemin suppressed the p38-MAPK/mTOR pathways in human monocytes, inhibiting inflammatory activation, differentiation, and LPS-induced cell death while preserving phagocytosis. The murine ALI model was established in WT, CCR2(-/-), and Nrf2(-/-) mice via tail vein injection of LPS, with assessments conducted 12 h later. In LPS-challenged mice, Hemin pretreatment selectively inhibited the recruitment of CCR2(hi) monocytes (but not CCR2(lo) monocytes or neutrophils) into the lungs, thereby attenuating histopathological injury, reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, and diminishing monocyte-derived macrophages and their M1/M2 polarization. CCR2 deficiency not only abrogated the therapeutic efficacy of Hemin in ALI, evidenced by the failure to prevent the LPS-induced increase in the proportion of monocyte-derived macrophages and the elevation of macrophage polarization, but also paradoxically elevated pulmonary TNF-alpha concentrations. Furthermore, experiments using Nrf2(-/-) mice revealed that the protective benefits of Hemin are strictly Nrf2-dependent. Nrf2 deficiency prevented Hemin from restoring the redox balance (GSH/GSSG ratio) and abolished its systemic and pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects, along with its suppression of CCR2(hi) subsets and inhibition of macrophages polarization. Collectively, our findings establish that activation of the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway mitigates ALI by selectively targeting CCR2(hi) pro-inflammatory monocytes, positioning Hemin as a promising therapeutic candidate for ALI and identifying the proportion of CCR2(hi) monocyte and Nrf2-mediated redox markers as potential biomarkers to guide precision medicine strategies for ALI management."
41651080,Iatrogenic plasticizer Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure increases Sepsis mortality risk: Machine learning implicates monocyte-driven immune dysregulation.,2026,"Sepsis poses a significant global health burden, and ICU patients are disproportionately exposed to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), an immunotoxic plasticizer that leaches from PVC medical devices; however, whether this exposure causally influences sepsis outcomes remains unclear. To investigate this relationship, we conducted a prospective cohort study comparing 90 ICU sepsis patients with 50 controls, quantifying urinary DEHP metabolites using LC-MS/MS. Sepsis patients demonstrated significantly elevated DEHP metabolite levels (p < 0.001), and high exposure (>/=341.58 mug/g creatinine) was independently associated with reduced 28-day survival (35% vs 55%, p = 0.04; HR = 1.92, 95%CI:1.01-3.65). To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this association, we integrated seven sepsis transcriptomic datasets with predicted DEHP targets, revealing 46 overlapping genes. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, and Random Forest) prioritized seven core genes, with SHAP analysis identifying MAPK14 as the predominant contributor. Molecular docking further confirmed high-affinity binding between DEHP and these target proteins. To establish causality, Mendelian randomization analysis using cis-eQTLs and FinnGen GWAS data demonstrated that genetically predicted higher MAPK14 expression increases sepsis susceptibility (OR = 1.18, p = 0.045). In conclusion, these findings provide converging evidence that high iatrogenic DEHP exposure is associated with increased sepsis mortality, potentially through MAPK14-mediated pathways, suggesting that DEHP exposure represents a modifiable risk factor in critical care settings and supporting the evaluation of DEHP-free alternatives for high-leach medical devices."
41650050,HCT-ALB difference as a predictor of 90-day all-cause mortality in non-elderly patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to the ICU: A retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV database.,2026,"The difference between hematocrit (HCT) and plasma albumin (ALB), denoted as HCT-ALB, has been proposed as a new predictor of sepsis and infectious diseases, among others. The role of this index in predicting all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), however, has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate the correlation between HCT-ALB and 90-day all-cause mortality in non-elderly patients with AP. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the MIMIC-IV (v1.0) database and included non-elderly adult patients diagnosed with AP who were admitted to the intensive care unit during the study. The primary outcome was the ability of HCT-ALB to predict mortality within 90 days of admission. A total of 254 patients met the inclusion criteria, and the mortality rate at 90 days after admission was 11.8%. A significant difference in HCT-ALB was observed between survivor and nonsurvivor groups, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting 90-day mortality was 0.692, with an optimal threshold value of 9.05 as calculated by the Youden Index. When modeled for prediction using HCT-ALB, age, and blood urea nitrogen, the predictive model showed good predictive efficacy. In conclusion, HCT-ALB serves as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality within 90 days of admission in non-elderly patients with AP. A predictive model that integrates HCT-ALB with age and serum urea nitrogen shows strong predictive efficacy."
41649833,Bulk Microarray and Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide-Related Biomarkers in Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by dysregulated host response to infection, poses significant global health challenges. Identifying lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-related biomarkers and underlying mechanisms remains critical, yet underexplored. We integrated bulk microarray datasets and single-cell RNA-seq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus to identify LPS-related genes associated with sepsis. scRNA-seq was used for cell clustering, annotation, AUCell scoring, and cell-cell communication analysis. Differentially expressed LRGs were screened from both bulk and single-cell datasets and intersected. Three machine learning algorithms-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and extreme gradient boosting-were applied to select robust diagnostic biomarkers. Gene expression was validated via qRT-PCR. Diagnostic and prognostic models were constructed and validated in independent cohorts. Seven key LRGs were identified. The diagnostic model achieved high AUCs (> 0.89) across validation cohorts, while the prognostic model effectively stratified patients into distinct survival groups. High-risk groups showed increased myeloid-derived suppressor cell and macrophage infiltration, activation of inflammatory pathways, and unique intercellular communication networks. scRNA-seq revealed cell-type-specific LRGs expression, particularly in myeloid populations. We established and validated a robust LPS-related biomarker model that integrates bulk microarray and single-cell transcriptomics, offering novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic insights for sepsis."
41649129,A machine learning model for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and sepsis: a study based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the best machine learning model for predicting 28-day mortality in septic patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC), leveraging data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database, 4th Edition (MIMIC-IV). METHODS: Clinical data of 1958 patients with AC complicated with sepsis were retrospectively extracted. Missing data (<20%) were addressed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). Key predictors were selected via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Patients were allocated to a training set (n=1268), a testing set (n=318), and a temporal validation set (n=372). Five models were developed and evaluated based on different performance metrics. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were performed to assess clinical applicability and predictor importance. RESULTS: LASSO regression identified 15 core variables. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best overall performance, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.946 (95%CI [0.932-0.960]) (sensitivity: 0.891) on the training set and an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI [0.838, 0.918]) on the test set, and an AUC of 0.819 on the validation set. The model was well-calibrated and provided a higher net benefit than 'treat-all' or 'treat-none' strategies across wide risk thresholds. SHAP analysis revealed the top 5 predictors to be: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, age, temperature, and SPO2. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance, providinga robust tool to guide personalized therapy and optimize critical care resource allocation."
41648664,An interpretable machine learning model for predicting sepsis risk in ICU patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: development and validation using the MIMIC-IV database.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) prediction model for assessing the risk of sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), thereby providing a reference for the early clinical identification of high risk patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, which includes admissions between 2008 and 2022. We extracted demographic information, laboratory parameters, complications, and other clinical data. Patients were randomly divided into a training set and a test set in an 8:2 ratio. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used to identify core predictive features. Fourteen machine learning models were constructed, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Kernel-based SVM, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares, Boosting Method, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, Lasso, XGBoost, CATBoost, and LightGBM. Key evaluation metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, Youden index, and the area under the curve (AUC). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to interpret the model's decision logic, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical utility. RESULTS: A total of 1,052 patients with non-traumatic SAH were enrolled, with 841 assigned to the training set and 211 to the test set. Lasso regression identified 11 core predictive features, including pneumonia, norepinephrine use, mechanical ventilation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) grade, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The CATBoost model demonstrated the best performance: in the training set, it achieved an AUC of 88.9%, sensitivity of 73.2%, specificity of 85.9%, and a Youden index of 0.592; in the test set, it achieved an AUC of 0.887, sensitivity of 75.5%, specificity of 82.3%, and a Youden index of 0.578. Performance fluctuation between the training and test sets was less than 2%, indicating excellent stability. SHAP analysis revealed that pneumonia, norepinephrine use, and mechanical ventilation were the top three features influencing sepsis risk, with pneumonia significantly increasing the risk. DCA results showed that the CATBoost model had the highest net benefit in the high-risk threshold range of 0.2-0.6. CONCLUSION: The machine learning model developed based on the MIMIC-IV database can effectively predict the risk of sepsis in ICU patients with non-traumatic SAH. It demonstrates good interpretability and clinical utility, providing a basis for clinical risk stratification and precise intervention."
41648205,Screening Molecular Recognition Element-Based SWCNT Optical Sensors for the Inflammatory Cytokine TNF-alpha.,2026,"TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a proinflammatory cytokine that amplifies inflammatory response and promotes leukocyte recruitment. TNF-alpha is primarily produced by activated macrophages, among others, in response to infection, inflammation, or tissue damage. Given its central role in normal and abnormal immune responses, it is the target of several therapeutics, such as adalimumab and etanercept. TNF-alpha is also a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, several kidney diseases, several cancers, Type 2 diabetes, sepsis, and others. Spatial quantification of TNF-alpha in disease models can also be a powerful tool to understand the contributions of inflammatory processes to disease progression. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are cylindrical carbon lattices that emit distinct near-infrared bandgap photoluminescence. In this work, we evaluated three aptamer-based sensor constructs, plus an additional two iterations of one aptamer sequence, and two antibody-based sensor constructs for TNF-alpha that use SWCNT near-infrared photoluminescence signal transduction. Several, but not all, of these aptamer and antibody-based sensors sensitively and selectively detected TNF-alpha in serum in a physiologically relevant range, and we found that their sensing was improved by both passivation and incorporating an exogenous quencher onto the aptamer sequence. Specifically, we found that modification of one aptamer sequence with a Black Hole Quencher induced selective detection in serum when passivated with poly-L-Lysine. This study highlights the importance, and challenges, of translating previously-validated molecular recognition elements to new detection conditions, in this case on the surface of SWCNT and in challenging serum conditions. It also validated a lead sensor construct that builds upon constructs that failed in serum. We anticipate that the sensors evaluated here will have utility in both the diagnosis and study of inflammation-driven chronic disease, while the sensor assessment framework will help drive the broader field of molecularly specific diagnostics."
41647515,"Beyond traditional-the sick cirrhosis patient scores integrating cytokine and immune profiling for precision prognosis in hospitalized cirrhosis patients may help predict infection, ICU admission and long-term death post hospitalization.",2026,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory biomarkers and immune cell function may provide prognostic value beyond traditional severity scores in hospitalized cirrhosis patients. We aimed to characterize inflammatory and immune profiles to determine their predictive value for ICU admission, infection, and long-term mortality, and to develop novel scoring systems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled 78 hospitalized cirrhosis patients. Comprehensive inflammatory profiling included 12 cytokines (multiplex immunoassay), flow cytometry immune markers, and acute phase reactants (e.g., procalcitonin). Outcome measures included ICU admission, infection, and death within 12-24 months. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors and develop three outcome-specific scoring systems. RESULTS: The cohort had a mean MELD3 of 25.14; 38.5% required ICU admission, and 12-24-month mortality was 43.6%. Independent predictors for infection were procalcitonin (>/=0.40 ng/mL), IL-6 (>/=84 pg./mL), and creatinine (>/=1.35 mg/dL) (AUC 0.74). ICU admission was predicted by hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, procalcitonin (>/=0.40 ng/mL), and IL-6 (>/=53.69 pg./mL) (AUC 0.82). Long-term mortality was predicted by ICU admission, hemoglobin (</=11.5 g/dL), EGF (</=2.9 pg./mL), and absolute nucleated cell count (</=3,600/muL) (AUC 0.821). CONCLUSION: Biomarkers reflecting systemic inflammation (IL-6, procalcitonin), immune paresis (low nucleated cell count), and failed regenerative capacity (low EGF) strongly predicted adverse outcomes. Integrating these markers into the proposed 'Sick Cirrhosis Patient Scores' may improve risk stratification, but these models require rigorous external validation."
41647513,Early increase in red cell distribution width-to-platelet ratio is associated with poor prognosis in sepsis patients: a retrospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported associations between baseline red cell distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR) and outcomes in sepsis patients. However, whether dynamic changes in RPR over time influence prognosis in sepsis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the significance of RPR trajectories during the progression of sepsis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included sepsis patients admitted to the ICU from January 2014 to December 2015, using data extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were collected. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was employed to compare longitudinal trends in RPR between survivors and non-survivors, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 2,226 patients were included, with 328 deaths within 28 days of hospitalization. Scaled RPR exhibited divergent temporal patterns between survivors and non-survivors. In the first 6 days of ICU admission, scaled RPR gradually decreased and stabilized in survivors, whereas non-survivors showed a pronounced early increase. After adjusting for multiple covariates, this dynamic trend remained significant. The difference in scaled RPR between survivors and non-survivors widened at an average rate of 1.75 units per day. CONCLUSION: During the early stage of ICU admission (0-6 days), RPR may serve as a dynamic biomarker reflecting evolving pathophysiological changes. Early increases in RPR were observed to be associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. These findings suggest that longitudinal RPR trajectories may provide supplementary information regarding risk stratification and warrant further investigation in conjunction with established clinical assessments."
41647022,Establishment and validation of a 28-day mortality prediction model based on the lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratio in patients with severe pneumonia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia (SP) is a common and often fatal disease. Traditional mortality risk assessments rely on complex scoring systems and lack simple, effective biomarkers. This study aims to explore the potential value of the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with severe pneumonia admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, from January 2020 to May 2025. Clinical data, laboratory indicators, and LAR values were collected. Cox regression analysis, the Boruta feature selection algorithm, and various machine learning models were employed for analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day survival status, and the relationship between LAR and mortality risk was evaluated, leading to the development of a prediction model based on LAR. RESULTS: Among the 491 patients, LAR was significantly associated with 28-day mortality risk and was identified as an independent risk factor for death in severe pneumonia. LAR demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC) in predicting mortality, exhibiting a significant nonlinear relationship with 28-day mortality risk. Among several machine learning models constructed using key variables selected by the Boruta algorithm, the random forest (RF) model exhibited the best predictive performance. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value analysis confirmed the dominant role of LAR in the RF model. CONCLUSION: LAR is an effective biomarker with significant clinical value in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. The LAR-based prediction model enhances the accuracy of mortality risk assessment, especially in non-septic patients. Combined with machine learning techniques, LAR offers a novel tool for early clinical risk evaluation and holds promising potential for clinical application."
41647020,Development and validation of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common and debilitating complication after sepsis. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict post-sepsis cognitive impairment and identify key clinical risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 866 adult sepsis patients treated in our hospital between January 2020 and January 2025 was analyzed. Cognitive function was assessed 1-3 months after discharge using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with scores < 26 indicating impairment. Key predictors were selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Five ML models-logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT)-were developed and evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied for interpretability. RESULTS: Cognitive impairment occurred in 195 patients (22.5%). Seven variables were identified as key predictors of cognitive impairment, including age, years of education, septic shock, benzodiazepine use, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) level. The RF model performed best, with AUCs of 0.947 (training set) and 0.895 (validation set), showing good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis showed that SOFA score had the greatest influence on cognitive impairment, followed by age, APACHE II score, IL-10, and years of education. CONCLUSION: Using SHAP analysis, the RF model provided clear insights into the key factors contributing to the model's prediction of cognitive impairment after sepsis. The model not only achieved high predictive accuracy but also offered a transparent, data-driven tool to identify patients at elevated risk, potentially enabling timely interventions and tailored clinical management."
41646190,Machine learning-driven sedation-analgesia optimization in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: In the intensive care unit (ICU), septic patients frequently require endotracheal intubation followed by invasive mechanical ventilation. Nonetheless, the optimal sedation-analgesia regimen for these critically ill patients remains undetermined. METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV version 3.0) database to examine septic patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and subsequent invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Initially, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the prognostic impact of different sedation-analgesia regimens. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was utilized to identify key prognostic factors. Multiple machine learning algorithms were then implemented to develop predictive models, and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the model outputs and determine the most influential predictors. RESULTS: Following the initial screening process, seven distinct sedation-analgesia regimens with sample sizes greater than 100 were incorporated into the final analysis. Utilizing Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models, the combination of fentanyl and midazolam was identified as the most advantageous regimen. This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding variables, demonstrating a reduction in the length of stay in the intensive care unit (length of stay in ICU, HR [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.52-0.85]) and a decrease in ICU mortality (OR [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.46-0.85]). Subsequently, LASSO regression analysis identified seven key prognostic factors associated with outcomes in this patient subgroup. Among the machine learning models developed for outcome prediction, the LightGBM model exhibited superior performance (AUC = 0.838). SHAP analysis indicated that the top three predictors of 28-day mortality were the Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), patient age, and the presence of acute renal failure. CONCLUSION: The concurrent administration of fentanyl and midazolam was associated with lower ICU mortality and shorter length of ICU stay among septic patients necessitating endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, suggesting potential clinical benefit. Furthermore, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited superior predictive accuracy for ICU mortality within this cohort, suggesting its potential utility as a tool for supporting data-driven clinical decision-making."
41646167,Vitamin B1 and sepsis: a prospective single-center study.,2026,"PURPOSE: Vitamin B1 (VB1), an essential coenzyme in cellular energy metabolism, is postulated to modulate clinical outcomes in sepsis. However, the relationship between VB1 and sepsis remains inadequately explored both domestically and internationally, and its potential clinical value remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between VB1 deficiency and the severity of sepsis, and to evaluate the potential clinical utility of VB1 in ameliorating sepsis-induced organ injury and coagulation dysfunction. METHODS: A total of 67 patients from Inner Mongolia Baogang Hospital were enrolled in this study. Among them, 41 were assigned to the sepsis group (clinically diagnosed with sepsis), and the remaining 26 comprised the control group (patients with ordinary pneumonia who did not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for sepsis). Serum VB1 levels were measured using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry from peripheral blood samples. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the potential of VB1 as an independent biomarker for sepsis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 27.0. RESULTS: The sepsis group exhibited significantly lower VB1 levels than the control group (p < 0.001). Further analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of sepsis patients in the VB1 deficiency group compared to the control group, whereas the VB1 sufficiency group showed a significantly lower proportion of sepsis patients (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis demonstrated significant negative correlations between VB1 levels and sequential organ failure assessment scores, procalcitonin, D-dimer, creatinine, and cardiac troponin I, and positively correlated with albumin. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that when VB1 was analyzed as a continuous variable, a high VB1 level was independently associated with a low prevalence of sepsis (OR = 0.127, 95% CI: 0.022-0.744, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: VB1 levels exhibit an inverse association with key inflammatory biomarkers in patients with sepsis, and reduced VB1 concentration is independently associated with a higher prevalence of sepsis."
41645706,Gut Microbiota-Non-Coding RNA Axis in Immune Modulation and Disease: From Mechanisms to Clinical Translation.,2026,"Immune homeostasis is indispensable for preserving organismal integrity, orchestrated through complex molecular networks encompassing immune cell dynamics, microbial cues, and epigenetic regulation. Among these, the gut microbiota-non-coding RNA (ncRNA) axis has recently garnered substantial attention as a multifaceted modulator of host immunity. Emerging evidence indicates that microbial-derived metabolites can reprogram ncRNA expression, thereby modulating immune cell differentiation, activation, and effector responses. Notably, dysregulation of this axis has been mechanistically implicated in the etiology of diverse immune-related pathologies, including colorectal cancer, sepsis, atherosclerosis, and neuroimmune conditions. Particularly intriguing is its translational potential: both microbial signatures and ncRNA profiles are being leveraged as diagnostic biomarkers and actionable targets for immune modulation. In this review, we delineate the molecular frameworks underpinning the gut microbiota-ncRNA-immune and explore how its perturbation contributes to pathogenesis. We further highlight emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this axis, underscoring its significance in precision immunology and host-microbiota co-regulation."
41645301,Microvascular phenotypes in pediatric sepsis identified by machine learning: prognostic implications for organ dysfunction and mortality.,2026,"BACKGROUND : Pediatric sepsis exhibits marked heterogeneity. Early integration of clinical, biomarker, and microcirculatory data may refine risk stratification and identify reproducible phenotypes associated with distinct outcomes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective sepsis cohort (2018-2024). A temporal split defined derivation (2018-2022) and validation (2023-2024) cohorts, including demographics, clinical variables, biomarkers, and sublingual videomicroscopy (GlycoCheck((R))). Dimensionality reduction was performed using Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data, followed by unsupervised clustering with Ward.D2. The primary outcome was persistence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at 72 h after admission. RESULTS: Among 239 patients (median age 2.1 years [IQR 0.5-11.1]; 52% female), three distinct microvascular phenotypes were identified: Preserved (n = 52), Partially Compensated (n = 75), and Decompensated (n = 112). Patients in the Preserved phenotype were older, required less organ support, and exhibited favorable microvascular indices, characterized by higher capillary density and mild glycocalyx alteration. Partially Compensated patients exhibited marked inflammatory activation, requiring greater vasoactive and ventilatory support and longer PICU stays. Microcirculatory assessment showed moderate reductions in capillary density and subtle glycocalyx changes, indicating a partially compensated response to inflammatory stress. Decompensated patients were predominantly younger and had more frequent multi-organ dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and universal mechanical ventilation, with the lowest capillary density and evidence of global microvascular failure. The risk of MODS within 72 h was highest in the Decompensated phenotype compared with the Preserved group (aHR 2.47; 95% CI 1.04-8.44; p = 0.042), with corresponding MODS rates of 42% and 10%, respectively, independent of age, infection focus, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Mortality followed a stepwise gradient (Preserved 1.9%, Partially Compensated 12.1%, Decompensated 17.2%; p = 0.023). Internal validation analyses reproduced phenotype assignments and outcome associations, confirming their temporal stability. CONCLUSIONS: Three reproducible microvascular phenotypes in pediatric sepsis-Preserved, Partially Compensated, and Decompensated-were identified using bedside clinical, biomarker, and microcirculation data. These phenotypes represent distinct pathophysiologic and prognostic patterns, from preserved states with favorable outcomes to decompensated forms linked to higher risk of organ dysfunction and death. Early microvascular phenotyping is feasible and enhances risk stratification.

41642619,Scalable and distributed individualized treatment rules for multicenter datasets.,2026,"Synthesizing information from multiple data sources is crucial for constructing accurate individualized treatment rules (ITRs). However, privacy concerns often present significant barriers to the integrative analysis of such multicenter data. Classical meta-learning, which averages local estimates to derive the final ITR, is frequently suboptimal due to biases in these local estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-smoothed weighted support vector machine for learning the optimal ITR. The accompanying loss function is both convex and smooth, which allows us to develop an efficient multiround distributed learning procedure. Such distributed learning ensures optimal statistical performance with a fixed number of communication rounds, thereby minimizing coordination costs across data centers while preserving data privacy. Our method avoids pooling subject-level raw data and instead requires only sharing summary statistics. Additionally, we develop an efficient coordinate gradient descent algorithm, which guarantees at least linear convergence for the resulting optimization problem. Extensive simulations and an application to sepsis treatment across multiple intensive care units validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
41642183,Melatonin as a Supportive Biomarker in Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Prospective Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) remains a diagnostic challenge because clinical signs are nonspecific and blood cultures, although the diagnostic gold standard may yield false-negative results due to low blood volumes or maternal antibiotic exposure. PURPOSE: To determine whether serum melatonin levels differ between term neonates with clinically suspected EOS and healthy controls, and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of melatonin relative to standard inflammatory markers. METHODS: This prospective case-control study included 84 term infants: 42 with clinically suspected EOS, defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria, and 42 controls. Blood cultures, complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and serum melatonin levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were obtained within 24 hours of life before antibiotic initiation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed for all suspected EOS cases and separately for culture-confirmed EOS. RESULTS: Eleven infants (26.2%) in the suspected EOS group had positive blood cultures. Mean melatonin levels were significantly lower in suspected EOS than in controls (193.5 +/- 61.8 vs 231.6 +/- 71.1 pg/mL; P = .010). However, melatonin levels did not differ significantly between culture-positive and culture-negative suspected EOS cases. ROC analysis for suspected EOS yielded an area under the curve of 0.628; a melatonin cutoff of 242 pg/mL provided 81% sensitivity but limited specificity (45.2%). ROC performance for culture-confirmed EOS was modest. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Melatonin demonstrates limited diagnostic specificity and should be interpreted only as a supportive marker within a multimodal evaluation strategy."
41641387,CD48 as a Novel Early Biomarker Complementing Procalcitonin and Lactate for Predicting Bacteremia in Pediatric Febrile Neutropenia: A Prospective Cohort Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication in pediatric oncology, where prompt recognition of bacteremia is critical for risk-adapted therapy and antimicrobial stewardship. Traditional biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are widely used, yet their early predictive value is inconsistent across studies. Cellular activation markers measured by flow cytometry, particularly CD48, have been scarcely investigated in this setting. This study aimed to evaluate conventional, metabolic, and immune biomarkers for predicting bacteremia in children with FN and to assess the incremental diagnostic value of CD48. METHODS: This prospective single-center cohort enrolled 38 pediatric oncology patients presenting with 46 FN episodes over 9 months. Clinical data, blood cultures, and serial measurements of CRP, PCT, lactate, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, MCP-1, sTREM-1, CD48, and CD64 were obtained at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Bacteremia was defined by positive culture for a recognized pathogen. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated the combined performance of biomarkers. RESULTS: Bacteremia occurred in 12 (26.1%) FN episodes. Sepsis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate were more common among bacteremic patients. CRP showed limited early discrimination (AUC 0.62 on day 2) but improved by day 4 (AUC 0.74). PCT was consistently higher in bacteremia (AUC 0.89 at day 4), and lactate demonstrated strong early predictive value (AUC 0.81). CD48 was significantly elevated from 0-24 h (AUC 0.78), outperforming CD64 (AUC 0.60) and preceding the rise in CRP. In combined modeling, PCT + CD48 + lactate achieved the highest discrimination (AUC 0.92; sensitivity 92%, specificity 85%). Post-hoc power analysis showed 82% power to detect AUC differences >/=0.15. CONCLUSION: Integration of CD4 with PCT and Lactate markedly improved diagnostic accuracy in this cohort; however, given the limited number of bacteremic episodes, these findings should be considered exploratory and require external validation in larger, multicenter studies before clinical implementation."
41640865,Clinical implications of a dynamic nomogram for predicting sepsis in acute liver failure.,2026,"This letter comments on a web-enabled, dynamic nomogram developed for early sepsis-risk estimation in adults with acute liver failure (ALF) admitted to the intensive care unit. The study successfully established and validated the sepsis in ALF model using five routinely available variables: Age, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, and mechanical ventilation. Across cohorts, the model demonstrated strong discrimination and outperformed traditional scores. We commend the inclusion of both Western and Chinese intensive care unit cohorts, which enhances the cross-population generalizability of the findings. This letter highlights the strengths of the model, including its web-based dynamic calculator and effective risk stratification, while also acknowledging limitations such as reliance on baseline admission data, restriction to intensive care unit populations, and the absence of infection-related biomarkers. We encourage further prospective, multicenter investigations to refine the sepsis in ALF model and expand its clinical utility."
41640744,Development and validation of a nutrition-integrated nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, necessitating early risk stratification. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for 28-day mortality in sepsis patients incorporating machine learning-selected biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 1,350 sepsis patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training (n = 944) and testing (n = 406) sets. LASSO and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to screen key biomarkers associated with mortality. A logistic regression model was constructed using the selected features, and a nomogram was developed by integrating these biomarkers with APACHE II, SOFA score, and shock status. Model performance was evaluated by AUC, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). External validation was performed in an independent cohort of 120 patients. RESULTS: Six biomarkers consistently selected by both LASSO and RF were: procalcitonin (PCT), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher levels of PCT, ALT, and IBIL, and lower levels of RBC, PLT, and PNI compared to survivors (all P < 0.05). The logistic regression model demonstrated strong discrimination [AUC: 0.841 (95% CI: 0.814-0.868) in training set; 0.808 (95% CI: 0.769-0.847) in testing set]. The nomogram showed good calibration and favorable net clinical benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities. In the external validation cohort, the model maintained excellent predictive performance with an AUC of 0.921 (95% CI: 0.876-0.966). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a clinically useful nomogram incorporating nutrition-related biomarkers, particularly PNI, for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. The model demonstrates robust performance and highlights the importance of nutritional status in sepsis outcomes."
41639792,Association of lactate-to-albumin ratio with 28-day mortality in elderly sepsis patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV database analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) is correlated with mortality in critically ill patients; however, its predictive value for sepsis in the elderly remains underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the data from the MIMIC-IV database. The primary outcome was 28-day ICU mortality in elderly patients with sepsis. We used multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), subgroup analyses, and machine learning (LightGBM/XGBoost/SVM) to assess the predictive capacity of LAR. RESULTS: Among 5,115 eligible patients, elevated log (LAR) independently predicted mortality, as a continuous variable (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.51-4.31; p < 0.001) and in quartiles (Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.72-2.59). The RCS indicated a linear LAR-mortality association (p for nonlinear = 0.12). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency across strata (interaction, p > 0.05). The LightGBM model achieved optimal discriminative performance (area under the curve = 0.788), with log (LAR) as the second-most important feature after the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II. CONCLUSION: LAR is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in elderly patients with sepsis, despite its limited standalone use. Our LightGBM-based integrative model demonstrated a robust prognostic performance and may aid in clinical decision-making and pending external validation. CLINICAL TRAIL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41639652,Explainable machine learning model for predicting short-term outcomes in sepsis- induced coagulopathy.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-Induced coagulopathy (SIC) is not only a common complication in the development process of sepsis but also related to poor prognosis of sepsis. We aimed to establish a machine learning (ML) model to predict the 28-day mortality risk of patients with SIC. METHODS: We collected data for model training from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Database version 2.2 to establish the model. We extracted patient data from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for the model's external validation. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors for a 28-day mortality risk. Then, we built prognostic prediction models for SIC patients using multiple ML classification models. We evaluated predictive performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). We used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the models. RESULTS: We selected seventeen variables for model development, and the XGBoost model performed the best. The area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI) of the test set reached 0.840 (0.810-0.870), with an accuracy of 0.807, sensitivity of 0.836, and specificity of 0.798. The model also demonstrated excellent predictive performance in external validation, with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.864 (0.794-0.934). CONCLUSION: We constructed an XGBoost model and provided model interpretability using the SHAP. This model provides a basis for assessing the 28-day mortality risk of patients with SIC, aiding in clinical decision support and the formulation of personalized treatment strategies."
41636282,Monocyte distribution width reference intervals in healthy Chinese adults: a study revealing the impact of anticoagulant choice.,2026,"Monocyte distribution width (MDW) is a promising biomarker for early sepsis detection, but its use in Asian populations has been limited due to the lack of region-specific reference intervals (RIs). This study aimed to establish the first MDW RI for healthy Chinese adults using EDTA-K(2) anticoagulant, strictly following CLSI EP28-A3C guidelines. A total of 262 samples from healthy Chinese blood donors were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter DxH 900 analyzer. Statistical methods included Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality, t-tests, ANOVA for group differences, and Spearman correlation analysis, with RIs calculated using parametric, non-parametric, and robust methods. The parametric RI limits were determined to be 14.48 (90% CI 14.16-14.80) and 21.56 (90% CI 21.24-21.88), closely aligning with results from the robust method (14.41-21.55) and non-parametric method (14.70-21.52). Our findings are consistent with Spanish data obtained using EDTA-K(2) anticoagulant but differ from Italian data that used EDTA-K(3), highlighting the potential impact of anticoagulant type on MDW values. This RI is unaffected by gender or age, providing a critical diagnostic tool for early sepsis detection in Chinese clinical practice and emphasizing the need for further studies to investigate anticoagulant influences for global standardization."
41636191,Predictive value of dynamic plasma biomarkers for clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome; data on early biomarker kinetics and their link to severity are scarce. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 80 children with sepsis (March 2022 - June 2024). C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and D-dimer were measured at admission (T0), 72 hours (T1) later and on Day 7 (T2). Disease severity was assessed using the pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA); length of stay (LOS) was recorded. Baseline values, Day 7 levels, and changes Delta(T2-T0) were correlated with pSOFA and LOS. RESULTS: Baseline inflammatory profiles differed by etiology: median CRP and PCT on admission were roughly doubled in bacterial versus viral disease, while IL‑6 was highest in respiratory and abdominal infections. Nevertheless, all six markers decreased significantly over seven days (p </= 0.015) and the proportional declines were uniform across pathogens or foci (interaction p > 0.18). Higher admission CRP, PCT, IL‑6 and D‑dimer modestly correlated with greater organ dysfunction (r </= 0.55), whereas steeper week‑long falls in the same markers tracked with larger pSOFA improvement (r = -0.41 to -0.53; all p </= 0.002). SAA showed a weaker inverse association (r = -0.32, p = 0.008), whereas the decline in ESR was not significant. A pragmatic two‑step algorithm (admission CRP  >/= 60 mg/L, PCT  >/= 3 ng/mL, IL‑6  >/= 200 pg/mL or D‑dimer  >/= 1.5 mg/L; plus a >/= 50% drop in IL‑6 or PCT within 72 h) identified children who ultimately required intensive care unit (ICU) care or stayed >/= 7 days with an area‑under‑the‑curve of 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Both initial elevations and early declines in CRP, PCT, IL-6 and D-dimer mirror organ dysfunction and hospitalization duration in pediatric sepsis. Serial monitoring of these readily available markers may improve early risk stratification and guide therapy."
41636071,C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Preserves Vascular and Cardiac Function in Sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and a major cause of mortality in intensive care units worldwide, a clear unmet medical need. CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) regulates inflammation and cardiovascular homeostasis, but its involvement in sepsis pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. This study investigated the intrinsic role of CNP, and therapeutic potential of the peptide, in offsetting the pathogenesis of sepsis. METHODS: Plasma concentrations of CNP, and its N-terminal cleavage product NT-proCNP (N-terminal pro-CNP), were measured in sepsis patients. Cardiac function, vascular hemodynamics, endothelial integrity, and biomarkers of inflammation were analyzed in wild-type, endothelium-restricted (ecCNP(-/-)), or cardiomyocyte-restricted (cmCNP(-/-)) CNP knockout animals, or global NPR (natriuretic peptide receptor)-C(-/-) deficient mice, in etiologically distinct models of sepsis. CNP (0.2 mg/kg per d) was infused to rescue any adverse phenotype and probe therapeutic potential. RESULTS: Circulating (NT-proCNP) increased in sepsis patients and was associated with reduced disease severity. ecCNP(-/-) mice exhibited an aggravated phenotype compared with wild-type mice in experimental sepsis, exemplified by impaired microcirculatory flow, edema, and increased expression of inflammatory biomarkers. In addition, cmCNP(-/-) animals showed overt cardiac dysfunction following lipopolysaccharide treatment. This worsened phenotype was mirrored in NPR-C(-/-) mice, implying that this cognate NPR subtype underpins the salutary actions of endogenous CNP. Pharmacological CNP administration improved microvascular perfusion, cardiac output, and inflammation in wild-type and ecCNP(-/-), but not NPR-C(-/-), mice. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous CNP plays a protective role in sepsis by preserving microvascular perfusion, reducing inflammation, maintaining endothelial integrity, and sustaining cardiac function via NPR-C. Pharmacologically targeting CNP signaling warrants further evaluation as a potential therapeutic opportunity in sepsis."
41632865,Application of an l-Cysteine-Enhanced Ag NCs@C NF Amplification-Free ECL Biosensor for miRNA.,2026,"Even though a lot of research shows that blood miRNA-155 is a specific, early stage biomarker for sepsis and associated consequences, current detection techniques need to be improved. In this work, we created Ag NCs@C NF nanocomposite luminous materials using carbon nanoflowers (C NFs) as a framework. The Ag NCs@C NF signal is much improved by the addition of l-cysteine (l-Cys), causing the biosensor response to change from ""ON"" to ""super ON."" By modifying the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) into an artificial allosteric blocking ribozyme (BR(miRNA-155)) that specifically binds to miRNA-155, this ribozyme rapidly and repeatedly cleaves locked crRNA in the presence of miRNA-155, enabling non-nucleic acid amplification-based miRNA detection. This amplification-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor system detects miRNA-155 within a range of 100 aM-100 nM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 47.4 aM. Additional tests demonstrating specificity, sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility also yielded excellent performance. This technology opens new avenues for the early diagnosis of sepsis and its complications."
41632536,Plasma chondroitin sulfate predicts the effectiveness of fluid resuscitation strategies in patients with sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Plasma heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan released during endothelial glycocalyx degradation, predicts sepsis mortality. Chondroitin sulfate is a circulating glycosaminoglycan not specific to glycocalyx degradation; its relevance to sepsis is unknown. METHODS: We studied the associations of plasma chondroitin sulfate with (a) mortality in patients with sepsis-associated hypotension and (b) the relative effectiveness of a randomly-assigned liberal versus restrictive intravenous fluid resuscitation strategy. We selected 574 patients enrolled in the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis trial using an outcome-enriched sampling strategy. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify plasma chondroitin sulfate. In comparison, we measured hyaluronic acid as a glycocalyx degradation marker and IL-6 as an inflammatory biomarker. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to examine associations of baseline biomarker concentrations with mortality and resuscitation strategy effectiveness. We used inverse probability of selection weights and generalized raking to account for the non-representative sampling design. RESULTS: Plasma chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and IL-6 were associated with mortality within 90 days. As baseline chondroitin sulfate increased, subsequent randomization to a restrictive strategy was increasingly beneficial (p = 0.022): treatment effect hazard ratio (restrictive versus liberal) for mortality was estimated as 1.49 (95% CI 0.98-2.27), 1.30 (1.00-1.69), 1.09 (0.82-1.44), 0.88 (0.66-1.16), and 0.71 (0.52-0.97) for 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of baseline chondroitin sulfate. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma chondroitin sulfate predicts sepsis mortality and may modify the response to a subsequent liberal vs. restrictive intravenous fluid resuscitation strategy. CLINICALTRIALS: gov NCT03434028."
41630066,Association between antithrombin levels and prognosis in patients with sepsis: a retrospective cohort study based on the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III databases.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical determinant of mortality in critical patients. Antithrombin (AT) plays a pivotal role as a serine protease inhibitor with dual anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory functions, yet its precise role in prognostic stratification remains undefined. This study aimed to investigate the association between AT activity and clinical outcomes in sepsis and to identify critical prognostic thresholds. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 222 septic patients from the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III databases. AT activity was measured within the first 24 h following sepsis diagnosis, with the primary outcome defined as 28-day all-cause mortality. For preliminary description, AT activity was categorized into tertiles. The primary analysis utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to model the dose-response relationship and identify risk thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression models were employed to adjust for demographics, comorbidities, and SOFA score. Subgroup and survival analyses were performed to evaluate effect modification and visualize outcome differences across threshold-defined risk groups. To visually compare survival outcomes between patient groups defined by the RCS-derived risk thresholds, we generated Kaplan-Meier curves and employed log-rank tests. RESULTS: A non-linear relationship between AT activity and 28-day mortality was identified, with a marked increase in risk observed below approximately 55% in the overall cohort. Patients with AT activity < 55% had significantly higher 28-day mortality (34.2% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.001), ICU mortality (33.3% vs. 9.0%, p < 0.001), and incidences of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (22.5% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (78.4% vs. 62.2%, p = 0.013). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction with hypertension. In the hypertensive subgroup, a similarly elevated risk zone was observed below approximately 64% AT activity. Hypertensive patients below this level had markedly increased 28-day mortality (42.3% vs. 9.62%, p < 0.001), ICU mortality (38.5% vs. 5.77%, p < 0.001), and incidences of DIC (19.2% vs. 1.92%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reduced AT activity was significantly associated with higher mortality and organ dysfunction in sepsis. Risk thresholds were observed at approximately 55% for the overall cohort and 64% among hypertensive patients. Patients below these levels exhibited significantly increased mortality and higher incidences of DIC and AKI. These findings support AT activity as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification and highlight its potential to inform future management strategies for high-risk patients."
41629825,GSTP1 as a novel protective target in sepsis: evidence from proteome-wide Mendelian randomization and multi-omics analyses.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory syndrome with incompletely understood genetic mechanisms, necessitates identification of pathogenic proteins to advance precision medicine. This study integrated Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-omics analyses to systematically investigate causal proteins and their regulatory mechanisms in sepsis. METHODS: We employed a multi-step framework combining two-sample MR, expression validation, immune infiltration analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing and mediation analysis. Exposure variables included cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) from two plasma proteome datasets (4,907 proteins from Decode and 2,640 proteins from UKB-PPP), with sepsis (ieu-b-4980) and 28-day sepsis (ieu-b-5086) serving as the outcome. Intersection analysis revealed the candidate proteins common between the two cis-pQTL datasets, followed by multi-omics validation using microarray expression profiling, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). We also performed mediation analyses to assess whether immune cells potentially mediate causal pathways linking proteins to sepsis. Drug prediction was performed using DGIdb and molecular docking was subsequently used to identify the candidate drugs. RESULTS: MR analysis identified 97 (Decode) and 130 (UKB-PPP) sepsis-associated proteins, with 15 overlapping candidates. Among these, SFRP1, IL1RL1, and INHBB were validated as risk factors, while GSTP1 exhibited protective effects. They exhibited directionally concordant expression differences across an independent microarray dataset GSE95233. Furthermore, the associations of IL1RL1, INHBB, and GSTP1 with sepsis were replicated in the 28-day mortality dataset. ROC analysis demonstrated the superior diagnostic performance of GSTP1 for sepsis. MR further revealed that methylation at the GSTP1 locus cg25135322 increased the risk of sepsis (OR = 1.0844, 95% CI = 1.0339-1.1374). Immune infiltration analysis showed that GSTP1 expression was positively correlated with resting NK cells and CD8 + T cells, but negatively correlated with neutrophils. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the elevated GSTP1 expression in T cells and B cells, but reduced expression in monocytes of patients with sepsis. Mediation analysis suggested that CD39 + CD8br Treg cells might partially mediate the protective effects of GSTP1, accounting for 9.8% (Decode) and 11.47% (UKB-PPP) of the total effect, respectively. Four candidate drugs were identified, with Exatecan mesylate and Misonidazole showing optimal binding with GSTP1. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified three proteins with putative causal associations with sepsis risk, providing valuable clues for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis."
41629804,Impact of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities on severity and outcomes of hospital-acquired sepsis in intensive care patients: a case-control study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to microbial infection often leading to multiorgan failure and cardiovascular complications, which significantly contribute to mortality. This study aimed to identify key risk factors associated with disease severity among sepsis patients with distinct cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. METHODS: This hospital-based case-control study included 148 adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 311 non-septic controls with comparable cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Sepsis was diagnosed based on clinical criteria and confirmed by elevated serum procalcitonin levels. Serum procalcitonin, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were measured using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Associations between comorbidities and sepsis severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and logistic regression and survival among sepsis cases was explored using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Mostly infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Elevated serum procalcitonin levels were used to support the diagnosis of sepsis. Compared with controls, sepsis patients showed significant increases in serum levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, indicating an enhanced systemic inflammatory response. Statistical analysis showed that cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type-2 diabetes were significantly associated with increased disease severity. Descriptive survival analyses among sepsis patients suggested lower survival probabilities in those with rheumatic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities particularly myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with sepsis requiring intensive care. Elevated inflammatory cytokine levels characterize the systemic immune response in these patients. These findings highlight the importance of early risk stratification in septic patients with underlying cardiometabolic disease."
41629610,Sepsis and the immunometabolic inflammatory response.,2026,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterised by dysregulated immunity, inflammation and metabolic disruption. Despite improved care, it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, highlighting the need for improved mechanistic insight. Immunometabolism has emerged as a framework for understanding sepsis pathophysiology. Conventional prognostic tools reflect downstream organ injury but not the metabolic states of immune cells. Emerging technologies now enable high-resolution profiling of immunometabolic changes and integrating these approaches may yield metabolic biomarkers capable of tracking immune function and refining diagnostics. This review summarises current knowledge of leukocyte metabolic dysfunction in sepsis and highlights how immunometabolic profiling can inform patient monitoring and advance biomarker-driven precision medicine."
41629096,[Disseminated cryptococcosis resulting in fungal septic shock: a case report].,2026,"Fungal sepsis and septic shock are syndromes involving acute organ dysfunction that result from a dysregulated host response to invasive fungal infections. These syndromes are characterized by diagnostic challenges, rapid progression, complex management, high medical costs, and high mortality, particularly among immunocompromised patients. This article mainly presents a case of fungal septic shock caused by disseminated Cryptococcosis, which resulted in death within a short period. It emphasizes the importance of the principle of ""early warning and rapid intervention"" in clinical practice for fungal sepsis. Additionally, it suggests the integration of fungal biomarkers into sepsis scoring systems as a crucial step towards the rapid identification and precise treatment of fungal sepsis."
41626985,Optimal large language models to screen citations for systematic reviews.,2025,"Recent studies highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) in citation screening for systematic reviews; however, the efficiency of individual LLMs for this application remains unclear. This study aimed to compare accuracy, time-related efficiency, cost, and consistency across four LLMs-GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.3 70B-for literature screening tasks. The models screened for clinical questions from the Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2024. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each model based on conventional citation screening results for qualitative assessment. We also recorded the time and cost of screening and assessed consistency to verify reproducibility. A post hoc analysis explored whether integrating outputs from multiple models could enhance screening accuracy. GPT-4o and Llama 3.3 70B achieved high specificity but lower sensitivity, while Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited higher sensitivity at the cost of lower specificity. Citation screening times and costs varied, with GPT-4o being the fastest and Llama 3.3 70B the most cost-effective. Consistency was comparable among the models. An ensemble approach combining model outputs improved sensitivity but increased the number of false positives, requiring additional review effort. Each model demonstrated distinct strengths, effectively streamlining citation screening by saving time and reducing workload. However, reviewing false positives remains a challenge. Combining models may enhance sensitivity, indicating the potential of LLMs to optimize systematic review workflows."
41625897,Comparative Evaluation of Platelet Indices in Clinical and Culture-Positive Neonatal Sepsis: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is among the significant causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Blood culture, the diagnostic gold standard, is limited by delayed results and low sensitivity. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) may offer early, accessible biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of platelet indices, i.e., MPV and PDW, in clinical and culture-positive neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 170 neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the NICU at MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Participants were categorized into clinical (n = 88) and culture-positive (n = 82) sepsis groups. Platelet parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 170 neonates enrolled, 82 (48.2%) had culture-positive sepsis, while 88 (51.8%) were categorized as clinical sepsis. MPV and PDW were significantly higher in both the culture-positive group and the clinical sepsis group. CONCLUSION: MPV and PDW are significantly elevated in both the culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis and the clinical sepsis group. Platelet indices may serve as supportive diagnostic markers in resource-limited settings. Their integration with clinical and laboratory findings could enhance early diagnosis."
41625880,Predictive Value of Procalcitonin and C-reactive Protein for Mortality in Live Donor Liver Transplant Recipients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Accurate biomarkers are crucial for the early diagnosis of sepsis after liver transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting bacterial infections and mortality following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODOLOGY: We prospectively analyzed all adult LDLT patients at a tertiary center between January 2021 and December 2022. CRP and PCT levels were measured on postoperative days (POD) one, three, five, and seven, and compared among patients without infections, those with bloodstream infections, and those with other infections (urinary, bronchoalveolar lavage, or drain). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of PCT and CRP trends on short- and long-term mortality. RESULTS: Among 216 LDLT patients, 122 (56%) were analyzed after applying exclusion criteria. In patients without infections, median CRP and PCT levels were elevated on days one (CRP: 19, interquartile range (IQR): 11-29; PCT: 3, IQR: 1-13) and three (CRP: 18, IQR: 7-30; PCT: 2, IQR: 1-9) but decreased by days five (CRP: 10, IQR: 5-16; PCT: 1, IQR: 0.2-3) and seven (CRP: 10, IQR: 3-17; PCT: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-3). No absolute values of CRP or PCT effectively diagnosed infections. Patients with a decreasing trend in CRP from POD three to five to seven had survival rates of 90%, 86%, and 85% at 30, 90, and 600 days, respectively; in contrast, those with an increasing CRP trend had lower survival rates of 78%, 71%, and 40%, respectively. Similarly, a decline in PCT was associated with 30-, 90-, and 600-day survival rates of 90%, 85%, and 84%, while increasing PCT correlated with significantly lower rates of 75%, 70%, and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: While the absolute values of CRP and PCT were not diagnostic for infection, an increase in these biomarkers from days three to five to seven predicted significantly higher short- and long-term mortality in LDLT recipients."
41624884,Identification and validation of an endotoxin tolerance-based prognostic model with therapeutic insights in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis outcomes remain difficult to predict because immune trajectories are heterogeneous and dynamically shift from early activation to immunosuppression. Endotoxin tolerance (ET) in circulating monocytes/macrophages is a key mechanism of sepsis-associated immunosuppression but has not been systematically leveraged for prognostication. We sought to develop and clinically validate an ET-related gene (ETG) signature for short-term mortality risk stratification. METHOD: Public whole-blood transcriptomic datasets were intersected with curated ET gene sets to derive ETG candidates. An ensemble machine-learning framework (108 model/feature-selection combinations across 12 algorithms) was used to build and rank prognostic models for 28-day mortality; the final parsimonious signature (10 ETGs, including IL4R, ATM, CX3CR1, FCGR1A) informed a risk score. A two-variable nomogram (age + ETG risk score) was constructed. Internal performance was assessed by bootstrapped calibration, time-dependent ROC/AUC at 7, 14, and 28 days, and Harrell's C-index. Experimental validation used a prospective ICU cohort (n=50; 13 survivors, 37 non-survivors). PBMCs were profiled by RT-qPCR and Western blot; CD14(+) monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for FCGR1A/CD64, CX3CR1, and PD-1. We further explored regulatory context (ceRNA network) and druggability (DGIdb query and molecular docking to CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5). RESULTS: The 10-gene ETG signature stratified mortality risk with acceptable discrimination and calibration. AUCs were 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.83), 0.78 (0.72-0.83), and 0.73 (0.67-0.78) at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively; Harrell's C-index was 0.782. The age-integrated nomogram showed close agreement between predicted and observed survival across timepoints. Functional enrichment indicated immune-response pathways enriched in the low-risk group. In the clinical cohort, non-survivors exhibited lower mRNA and protein levels of FCGR1A, TLR5, and CX3CR1 in PBMCs; flow cytometry revealed reduced proportions of FCGR1A(+), CX3CR1(+), and PD-1(+) CD14(+) monocytes (p<0.01). The ceRNA analysis highlighted a putative NEAT1/miR-1287-5p/CX3CR1 axis. Docking suggested plausible ligandability of CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5, nominating candidates such as valproic acid and CGP-52608 for follow-up testing. CONCLUSION: An ET-anchored, 10-gene signature captures a clinically relevant axis of sepsis-associated immunosuppression and enables short-term mortality risk stratification. Integration with age yields a simple nomogram with stable internal performance. Multilayer validation (transcript, protein, single-cell) supports biological plausibility. Prospective multicenter studies with richer clinical annotation and functional assays are warranted to confirm generalizability and to evaluate ET-guided immunomodulatory strategies."
41624862,Immune signatures of sepsis from mild infection to critical illness - a prospective observational study.,2025,"Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is a phenomenon characterized by the development of several changes in immunophenotype which predispose to secondary infections and increased mortality risk. Immunomodulatory therapies have yet to reproducibly demonstrate benefit in large clinical trials. We propose that several changes consistent with an immunosuppressive phenotype in sepsis represent either adaptive changes or epiphenomenon, rather than direct drivers of outcome in infection and sepsis. We therefore conducted a prospective observational study of patients presenting with infections with a spectrum of illness severity, to evaluate canonical features of monocyte and lymphocyte immunosuppression using flow cytometry. Several features consistent with immunosuppression in sepsis are observed in mild infections and non-infectious acute conditions. These features may be better understood as markers along a continuum of illness severity rather than distinct features of critical illness. Monocyte HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), and an increase in soluble PD-L1, discriminate between critically ill patients, patients with mild infection, and patients with non-infectious illness. In contrast, CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte phenotype did not discriminate between patient groups. Immunotherapies targeting lymphocyte function may only be effective if simultaneously augmenting monocyte antigen presentation and co-stimulatory pathways. Combination immunotherapy in sepsis requires evaluation."
41624837,Multi-omics machine learning identifies diagnostic gene signatures and functionally supports PRKACB involvement in macrophage inflammatory responses in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response, often leading to organ failure and death. Diagnosis and therapy remain challenging. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for sepsis through multi-omics analysis and experimental validation. A total of 1,166 samples from the GEO repository underwent differential analysis, WGCNA, and logistic regression to identify sepsis-associated features. After SVM-RFE screening, a 28-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from healthy controls achieved an AUC of 0.970 (sensitivity 0.939, specificity 1.000) in an independent cohort and 0.870 (sensitivity 0.906, specificity 0.700) in qRT-PCR validation. A 13-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from SIRS achieved an AUC of 1.000 (sensitivity 1.000, specificity 1.000) and 0.745 (sensitivity 0.500, specificity 0.900), respectively. PRKACB, consistently decreased in sepsis, emerged as a myeloid-associated hub gene with functional support in macrophages. Single-cell analysis revealed that PRKACB is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, with macrophages and neutrophils showing the most notable compositional changes. Pathway enrichment indicated distinct PRKACB-related functions between sepsis and healthy controls, and across myeloid subtypes. Reducing PRKACB expression significantly upregulated TNF-alpha and IL-1beta release and decreased THP-1 macrophage viability, suggesting that excessive inflammation may trigger apoptosis or metabolic dysfunction. These data support PRKACB as a myeloid hub linked to macrophage inflammatory output and viability, while defining the precise downstream signaling as a priority for future studies."
41624828,High CRP and white blood cell counts are not reliable indicators of early-onset neonatal infection in full-term infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) is challenging, making it difficult to determine infection indicator characteristics and cutoff values in full-term infants. This study retrospectively analyzed full-term infants with high-risk factors for neonatal EOS but tested negative for EOS, aiming to identify infection indicator characteristics and their association with perinatal factors without antibiotic intervention. METHODS: Full-term infants at high risk for EOS who were admitted to rooming-in from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024 were included in the study. Blood routine examinations and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were dynamically monitored after birth. All demographic data and medical records were collected from the electronic medical records system. RESULTS: Among 103 neonates, only 2 had normal infection indicators. Within 24-48 h after birth, an additional 28 displayed normal infection indicators. Although most of the infants exhibited normal WBC within 24-48 h, 33 patients still had higher neutrophil percentages, and 62 had higher CRP levels. Moreover, several high-risk perinatal factors for abnormal infection indicators have been identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that infection indicators frequently showed abnormalities in full-term infants at high risk for EOS who tested negative. Few infants had normal infection indicators within 24 h, and although WBC levels normalized by 24-48 h, CRP levels remained elevated. Specific perinatal factors were also associated with abnormal infection markers. These findings reinforce the need for cautious interpretation of isolated biomarker elevations and support antimicrobial stewardship by highlighting the high frequency of abnormal indicators in uninfected infants, thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure."
41624750,"The role of artificial intelligence in burn assessment, complication diagnosis, and outcome prediction: a narrative review.",2026,"Burn injury remains a major global health challenge, causing an estimated 180 000 deaths annually. The marked heterogeneity in burn severity, complications, and outcomes highlights the need for more objective and efficient evaluation strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to support clinical decision-making and improve patient care in this field. In this narrative review, we summarize the growing applications of AI in burn care, including the assessment of burn depth and total body surface area, monitoring of wound healing, prediction of postburn complications, and estimation of clinical outcomes. AI-based models have demonstrated strong performance in automating wound assessment, optimizing fluid resuscitation, and predicting complications such as sepsis, inhalation injury, and acute kidney injury. Furthermore, AI-driven prediction of mortality risk and hospital length of stay has shown potential to inform early interventions and improve resource allocation. Despite encouraging progress, most studies to date rely on small, single-center datasets and limited model validation, underscoring the need for larger, multi-institutional efforts, and standardized data sharing. Integrating AI into burn management holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic precision, forecasting outcomes, and personalizing treatment strategies. As these technologies advance, clinician familiarity and collaboration with AI tools will be critical to fully realize their potential in transforming burn care."
41624605,Endothelial cell injury: a crucial link in microcirculatory dysfunction associated with sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a prevalent and severe condition, with microcirculation disruptions playing a crucial role in its progression. Endothelial cell (EC) injury is the primary factor behind microcirculatory issues. This review is to outline the pathomechanism, organ heterogeneity, biomarkers, and therapeutic implications of endothelial dysfunction in sepsis, offering references and insights for the clinical management of sepsis. METHODS: A systematic search of Web of Science and PubMed from inception to June 10, 2025, limited to English publications, was conducted. Two reviewers independently identified studies on EC injury in patients with septic microcirculatory dysfunction. Duplicate articles based on multiple search criteria were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-nine articles, including cell, animal, and clinical studies, were included. These studies reported the effects of EC injury on the microcirculation in sepsis, including changes in vascular permeability, coagulation dysfunction, vasomotor regulation, and inflammatory responses. These pathways interact and ultimately lead to septic microcirculation disorders. CONCLUSION: Sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction involves various interconnected mechanisms, which collectively compromise ECs and impede microcirculatory perfusion. Future research should enhance current understanding of endothelial injury mechanisms, develop synergistic multi-target strategies to disrupt this cycle, and facilitate the clinical application of endothelial markers for early intervention and dynamic assessment."
41624233,Platelet lipidome alterations in septic shock: a matched case-control study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Platelets play a central role in hemostatic and inflammatory responses during septic shock, with lipids being essential for their function. However, the specific lipidomic alterations occurring in platelets during septic shock remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize platelet lipidomic changes in septic shock and investigate their associations with disease severity. METHODS: In this matched case-control study, platelets were isolated from 49 septic shock patients and 47 nonseptic controls (matched for age, gender, and comorbidities). Lipidomic profiling was performed using untargeted lipidomics to identify significant alterations in the platelet lipidome. Associations among lipid changes, clinical data, and plasma biomarkers of coagulopathy and inflammation were explored. RESULTS: More than 60% of the annotated platelet lipids were significantly altered in septic shock. Cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and ether-lipids were significantly reduced, while ceramide levels increased. Fatty acyl chain remodeling displayed distinct patterns, with polyunsaturated fatty acids increasing in triacylglycerols and decreasing in phospholipids. Lipid alterations were strongly associated with thrombocytopenia, and lysophosphatidylcholine levels inversely correlated with disease severity, as indicated by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock induces significant disruptions in the platelet lipidome, with the extent of these alterations correlating with sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia severity. The observed changes affect multiple lipid classes, surpassing those reported under physiological conditions or in other diseases. These findings highlight the impact of sepsis-driven dysregulated inflammation and coagulopathy on platelet lipid composition, providing new insights into sepsis pathophysiology."
41623714,Implementation of machine learning in emergency departments: A systematic review.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to evaluate studies that implemented and evaluated machine learning models in emergency department settings, focusing on their clinical and operational impact. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases from inception to January 2024. Studies were eligible if they assessed the implementation of machine learning models in emergency departments, with a particular focus on clinical and operational impact. RESULTS: A total of 84 studies met the inclusion criteria. Gradient boosting and neural networks were the most frequently used models. Mortality prediction models achieved AUC values ranging from 0.618 to 0.978, with key predictors including age, sex, race, vital signs, and comorbidities. Disposition prediction models showed AUC values of 0.675-0.96, often incorporating age, sex, vital signs, triage data, and past medical history. Length of stay prediction studies identified demographic data, triage level, chief complaints, and comorbidities as significant predictors, with gradient boosting models yielding the highest predictive accuracy. Machine learning-based treatment decision models showed promise in sepsis detection and cardiovascular triage. Wait time prediction models using gradient boosting decreased patient wait times by 18%-26%. Emergency department cost prediction studies were limited, with logistic regression models achieving AUCs of 0.71-0.76 for identifying high-cost patients. CONCLUSION: Machine learning is widely used in emergency department research, but issues with generalizability and workflow integration limit its clinical use. Future work should improve data quality, representation, and ongoing model validation to enhance real-world utility."
41622794,Plasma Proteomic Profile of Chemotherapy-Induced Severe Neutropenia: A Pilot Discovery Phase Study.,2026,"Transient severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are frequent during treatment of hematological malignancies and contribute to early mortality through sepsis and bleeding. While neutrophils and platelets are essential for host defense and tissue repair, little is known about immune adaptations during their depletion. In this pilot, discovery phase study, we evaluated the plasma proteome of 10 patients with chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, prior to any clinical complication. At sampling, mean neutrophil and platelet counts were 0.15 +/- 0.18 x 10(9)/L and 34.6 +/- 17.4 x 10(9)/L, respectively. A total of 762 proteins were identified, of which 71 were downregulated and 21 were upregulated in patients compared with healthy controls. Over-representation analyses revealed that most downregulated proteins were related to immune responses, hemostasis, and protein metabolism. Notably, six upregulated proteins (USP8, IGFBP2, RCN1, B2M, LRG1, and C9) also mapped to these pathways, supporting the hypothesis that they may contribute to early systemic responses to chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity and tissue damage. This exploratory study leveraged a unique clinical window to examine how the human immune system responds to the marked reduction of neutrophils and platelets in the context of tissue and barrier disruption. The downregulation profile suggests impairment of the host's immunothrombotic defense, whereas the upregulated proteins may represent early compensatory mechanisms aimed at preserving homeostasis. Together, these findings provide insights into systemic responses during profound cytopenias and highlight candidate proteins that may mediate early adaptations to hematopoietic and tissue injury in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy."
41622254,Evaluating the role of serum IL1R2 as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic stratification in sepsis.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify novel sepsis biomarkers by evaluating serum interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2) for its diagnostic and prognostic utility, in light of the limitations of current markers like PCT and CRP. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted involving 55 sepsis patients and 42 non-sepsis controls. Serum IL1R2 levels, measured via ELISA within 24 h of admission, were compared against clinical data, including SOFA scores, 28-day mortality, and laboratory parameters (PCT, CRP). Diagnostic performance was assessed using ROC curve analysis, while prognostic utility was determined via Kaplan-Meier analysis. A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to track IL1R2 dynamics over time. RESULTS: Sepsis patients exhibited significantly elevated serum IL1R2 levels compared to controls. IL1R2 demonstrated strong diagnostic power (AUC = 0.908), outperforming PCT and CRP. Furthermore, higher IL1R2 levels correlated with increased SOFA scores and predicted poorer 28-day survival. In the CLP model, serum IL1R2 rose within 4 h post-sepsis, peaked within 24 h, returned to baseline by day 3, and fell below normal by day 7. CONCLUSION: Serum IL1R2 is a promising biomarker, offering a superior ability to correlate with disease severity and predict 28-day mortality."

41619875,"Nose-to-brain axis: mechanistic links between nasal microbiome dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and brain disorders.",2026,"The nasal microbiome has emerged as a previously underrecognized modulator of neuroinflammation and central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Beyond its role in respiratory host defense, this microbial niche is anatomically positioned to directly influence brain physiology through olfactory neuronal pathways, systemic immune signaling, and inter-organ communication within the gut-lung-brain axis. Accumulating evidence indicates that nasal microbiome dysbiosis contributes to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, microglial activation, and propagation of neurotoxic protein aggregates, processes implicated in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depressive disorder. This review synthesizes experimental and clinical studies elucidating key mechanisms by which nasal microbial imbalance may impact CNS pathology, including microbial translocation along olfactory neurons, release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory mediators, extracellular vesicle-mediated signaling, and peripheral immune crosstalk. We further highlight clinical observations linking nasal microbiome signatures with olfactory dysfunction, cognitive decline, and altered inflammatory profiles, particularly in systemic conditions such as sepsis. Despite rapid advances in this field, significant knowledge gaps persist, including the limited availability of longitudinal human cohorts capable of establishing causality, incomplete mechanistic validation in translational models, and insufficient characterization of how environmental exposures and aging reshape the nasal microbiome-brain interface. By integrating current evidence and defining these unmet needs, this review positions the nasal microbiome as a promising source of diagnostic biomarkers and a therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and mitigating neurodegenerative progression."
41619405,"Acute effects of physical exercise on biomarkers of the trace elements selenium, zinc, copper, and iron.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is important for a healthy lifestyle but may have side effects, especially when performed in an excessive manner. This includes effects on the immune system but can also result in a higher need for certain micronutrients such as the trace elements selenium, zinc, copper, and iron. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize short-term effects of a standardized 1-minute sit-to-stand-test (STST) on serum concentrations of these trace elements. METHODS: 20 healthy individuals performed the STST. Capillary blood samples were drawn 10 min before, immediately after, 30, and 60 min post-exercise. Lactate, glucose, and blood cell counts were determined together with the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The trace element concentrations and the biomarkers free zinc (fZn), and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) were analysed. All values except for fZn and NLR were adjusted for hemoconcentration. RESULTS: Immediately after the STST, the levels of copper and selenium decreased significantly, which subsequently returned to baseline values. SELENOP levels showed a similar pattern to that of total selenium concentrations but only increased significantly after 60 min, compared to immediately after exercise. In contrast, no changes were observed for total zinc concentrations. FZn increased significantly immediately after the STST, before decreasing. Iron levels were higher immediately after the STST and rose significantly after 60 min. The cellular inflammatory markers NLR and SII decreased significantly after exercise and then increased compared to pre-test values. However, this was only significant for NLR. In contrast, SIRI increased continuously after physical activity, reaching significantly higher values after 60 min. CONCLUSION: Short-term acute physical exercise modulates serum trace element concentrations together with inflammatory parameters. Accordingly, these might be connected to each other which should be analyzed after more extensive, long-term or repeated exercise."
41617215,Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit: Multicenter Retrospective Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and severe complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. Conventional risk stratification tools lack sepsis-specific features and may inadequately capture complex, nonlinear interactions among clinical variables. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for the early prediction of VTE in ICU patients with sepsis. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database for model development and internal validation, and an independent cohort from Changshu Hospital for external validation. Candidate predictors were selected through univariate analysis, followed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Retained variables were used in multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors, which were then used to develop 9 ML models, including categorical boosting, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, light gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machine. Performance was evaluated by discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]), calibration, and clinical use (decision curve analysis). A subgroup analysis stratified by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was conducted in the external cohort to assess model stability across sepsis severity levels. Model interpretability was assessed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of features to the predicted risk. RESULTS: A total of 25,197 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV cohort and 328 patients from the external cohort were included, with VTE incidences of 844 out of 25,197 (3.4%) and 30 out of 328 (9.2%), respectively. The light gradient boosting machine model performed best, achieving an AUC of 0.956 in internal validation. Despite the higher VTE incidence and clinical severity in the external validation, the model maintained robust generalization with an AUC of 0.786. Notably, the model achieved enhanced discriminative ability in the severe sepsis subgroup (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >6) with an AUC of 0.816, compared with 0.769 in the mild to moderate sepsis subgroup. Calibration curves indicated strong agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and decision curve analysis showed superior net benefit across clinically relevant thresholds. SHAP analysis identified central venous catheterization, serum chloride and bicarbonate levels, arterial catheterization, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time as the most influential predictors. Partial dependence plots revealed both linear and nonlinear associations between these variables and VTE risk. Individual-level force plots further enhanced interpretability by visualizing personalized risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a high-performing and interpretable ML model for predicting VTE in ICU patients with sepsis. The model demonstrated robustness across cohorts and enhanced performance in the severe sepsis population. By integrating diverse clinical data and leveraging SHAP for transparent explanations, this tool may support personalized prophylaxis and early diagnostic strategies."
41616376,Machine Learning-Based Integrative Analysis Identifies SUMOylation-Related Genes Underlying the Immune Heterogeneity of Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis heterogeneity poses a challenge to accurate diagnosis and treatment. The impact of SUMOylation, a post-translational modification, on sepsis is largely unexplored. We integrated three GEO datasets to construct a large-scale sepsis cohort and applied three machine learning algorithms to screen hub genes from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SUMOylation in sepsis. Unsupervised consensus clustering was performed to identify sepsis subtypes. Using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA), we analysed the immunological and functional features of these subtypes. We assembled the regulatory network of hub genes and performed drug prediction analysis. The expression of hub genes was confirmed in a murine caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model through qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis identified a total of 43 SUMOylation-associated DEGs. The machine learning pipeline further pinpointed eight hub genes: TOP2B, HDAC4, NUP43, HNRNPK, BCL11A, RPA1, RORA and XRCC4. Each gene exhibited high diagnostic potential. Based on this eight-gene signature, sepsis patients were stratified into two subtypes. Subtype A, known as immune suppressive, was characterised by high infiltration of regulatory T cells, along with suppressed activity in immune pathways. The hyper-inflammatory subtype B displayed large infiltration of effector lymphocytes and extensive activation of inflammatory pathways. Drug prediction analysis revealed possible therapeutic compounds, particularly the epigenetic modulator vorinostat. Experimental validation ultimately confirmed the dysregulation of these hub genes. In conclusion, our study discovered a novel eight-gene signature associated with SUMOylation that supports new diagnostic strategies, and uncovers sepsis heterogeneity. The identification of two sepsis subtypes with different immunological and functional characteristics emphasises the role of SUMOylation in sepsis pathophysiology and provides a new strategy for advancing precision diagnostics and personalised therapy."
41614879,"Circulating miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p in Post-Mortem Whole Blood: An Exploratory Study of the Association with Sepsis-Related Death.",2025,"Accurate post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis remains a critical challenge in forensic pathology, as conventional morphological findings often lack specificity. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as stable molecular biomarkers, yet their diagnostic value in cadaveric samples is still unclear. This exploratory study investigated the expression of three candidate miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p) in post-mortem peripheral whole blood to assess their association with sepsis-related death versus non-infective controls. Out of 58 cases, 45 met quality-control criteria (26 sepsis-related deaths and 19 controls). miRNA expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, normalized to miR-320, and analyzed using DeltaCt values. Group differences were evaluated using linear regression models with adjustment for age, sex, and post-mortem interval, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. In adjusted models, miR-125b-5p and miR-27a-3p showed evidence of association with sepsis status, whereas miR-122-5p did not. These results support the feasibility of miRNA quantification in post-mortem samples and motivate validation in larger, independent cohorts and within multimodal post-mortem diagnostic frameworks."
41614763,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Pediatric Infections: A Systematic Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are granule- and nucleus-derived structures that support innate immunity. While the contribution of NETs to adult infections and autoimmune diseases is well studied, evidence in children is still inconsistent. This review aimed to summarize current findings on NETs in pediatric infections. METHODS: This study followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in major databases (MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus) from inception until 5 September 2025. The study quality was evaluated using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review. In respiratory disease, the role of NETs was well described and their formation correlated with severity. Patients with febrile urinary tract infections showed elevated urinary NET-associated markers. In COVID-19 infection, NET levels were unchanged in uncomplicated cases but elevated in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Findings in sepsis were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents the published evidence on NET formation in the pediatric population, assessing the current knowledge and identifying the gaps to guide research. Future studies should aim to standardize NET detection methods, evaluate their prognostic value in large prospective cohorts, and explore the various NET-associated mechanisms in children."
41612802,Correlation of Serum Magnesium Level with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score in Patients Admitted to MICU of a Tertiary Care Center in Southern Bihar.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Serum magnesium is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is commonly disrupted in critically ill patients as a result of sepsis, renal failure, and gastrointestinal losses. Serum magnesium is not often part of scoring systems used in intensive care units, like the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, which helps measure how serious a disease is and predict death, even though it is important for body function. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess the relationship between APACHE II scores and serum magnesium levels in patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was carried out over 24 months. Adult MICU patients with APACHE II scores >18 were included in the study. At admission, serum magnesium levels were measured, and 12 physiological parameters were used to calculate APACHE II scores. ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Serum magnesium levels and APACHE II severity categories showed a significant inverse relationship (F = 20.752, P < 0.001). Serum magnesium and total APACHE II score showed the strongest negative correlation (r = -0.597, P < 0.001). Serum sodium (r = 0.245, P = 0.007) and packed cell volume (r = 0.383, P < 0.001) showed positive correlations. CONCLUSION: According to the APACHE II scores, higher illness severity is substantially correlated with lower serum magnesium levels. In critically ill patients, serum magnesium may be a useful supplemental biomarker for risk assessment."
41612488,Identification of the biomarkers associated with lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress in pediatric sepsis through bioinformatics analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis constitutes a critical clinical condition characterized by organ failure and systemic inflammation, especially affecting children. Lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress are involved in various diseases, yet their roles in pediatric sepsis remain unclear. This study sought to discover and validate biomarkers associated with lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress in pediatric sepsis. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes were identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Lipid metabolism-related genes (LRGs) and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (ERGs) were sourced from literature. After weighted gene co-expression network analysis and intersections, candidate genes were screened by machine learning and validated. A nomogram was built, followed by various bioinformatics analyses and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmation. RESULTS: There were 12 candidate genes, and 4 of them (ACER3, DGAT2, GBA, and TSPO) were screened as biomarkers. A nomogram integrating these four biomarkers showed excellent predictive ability. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed their involvement in pediatric sepsis-related pathways. They correlated positively with stimulated dendritic cells and negatively with stimulated B cells. The molecular regulatory network included multiple RNAs and transcription factors. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) bound strongly to the biomarkers. qRT-PCR confirmed their high expression in pediatric sepsis patients' blood (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A total of 4 biomarkers (ACER3, DGAT2, GBA, and TSPO) related to lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress in pediatric sepsis were identified. These biomarkers offered fresh insights into the mechanisms and therapeutic approaches of pediatric sepsis."
41611834,A tri-omics and machine learning framework identifies prognostic biomarkers and metabolic signatures in sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis is a complex systemic inflammatory syndrome that currently lacks stable and specific biomarkers. Multi-omics integration combined with machine learning and single-cell analysis offers new approaches for elucidating molecular mechanisms and nominating candidate regulators for further validation. Establish an integrated analytical framework combining transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomics to identify sepsis-associated candidates and generate testable hypotheses for downstream mechanistic and translational studies. A multi-omics integrative framework was established by combining transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was first applied to identify modules significantly associated with sepsis, and key candidate genes were further refined using LASSO regression and SVM-RFE algorithms. Compare differentially expressed transcripts and proteins through quadrant analysis. Further leverage open-access proteome-phenome resources to assess the association between priority target proteins and sepsis-related phenotypes/disease risk. Metabolomic profiling was conducted to identify metabolites significantly correlated with the core genes and their enriched pathways. A joint gene-metabolite classification model was then constructed using logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, with predictive performance evaluated using ROC curve analysis. LASSO regression was used to visualize coefficient shrinkage and effect direction, while random forest-based feature importance quantified the relative contribution of each variable. Finally, leveraging the ITCM database, an in silico screening was performed to identify natural compounds with potential regulatory effects on TPR and ERN1 expression. TPR and ERN1 were prioritized as key candidate biomarkers associated with sepsis. External validation in GEO cohorts and analyses of protein-disease risk association databases further supported their reproducible disease association in external datasets, motivating further validation of their prognostic/diagnostic potential. Non-targeted metabolomics screening identified 136 differentially expressed metabolites associated with them, primarily enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism and fatty acid-related pathways. Metabolite-gene correlation integration linked these metabolic alterations to TPR/ERN1, suggesting their potential involvement in immune-metabolic pathway remodeling associated with sepsis heterogeneity. Single-cell transcriptomics provided cellular origin-level support, showing enrichment of TPR and ERN1 expression in immune subpopulations, including monocyte-macrophages and NK cells. A joint gene-metabolite model constructed using a fixed feature set (2 genes + 5 metabolites) demonstrated strong discriminatory potential in an internally derived cohort, though external validation in independent, multi-omics matched cohorts remains urgently needed. Finally, exploratory computational screening based on the ITCM database identified several potential active monomers in traditional Chinese medicine that may influence TPR or ERN1 expression, providing hypothesis-generating clues for subsequent mechanistic studies and drug translation. By integrating multi-omics data, TPR and ERN1 were identified as sepsis-associated candidate biomarkers and linked to immune-metabolic alterations associated with immune cells. The combined gene-metabolite signature panel and exploratory compound screening provide a hypothesis-generating framework for downstream experimental validation and clinical study design."
41611406,Ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence aptasensor for heparin-binding protein based on hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification and magnetic enrichment.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a multifunctional cationic protein that is rapidly released upon activation of neutrophils during infectious or inflammatory responses. It plays a crucial role in immune regulation and vascular permeability and has recently emerged as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of sepsis. However, conventional antibody-based immunoassays for HBP detection are often expensive, unstable, and labor-intensive, which limits their clinical applicability. Thus, developing sensitive, low-cost, and user-friendly sensing strategies for rapid and accurate HBP quantification is highly desirable. RESULTS: In this study, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor was developed by integrating aptamer-based recognition, magnetic enrichment, and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification for ultrasensitive detection of HBP. Upon specific binding of HBP to its aptamer, a trigger sequence immobilized on magnetic beads was exposed to initiate HCR, forming long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) structures capable of intercalating a large number of tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) (Ru(phen)(3)(2+)). This amplification process markedly enhanced the ECL signal, while magnetic separation effectively removed unbound species, reducing background noise. Under optimized conditions, the aptasensor enabled quantitative detection of HBP over a wide linear range of 140 fM-140 nM, with an ultra-low detection limit of 84.24 fM. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed ECL aptasensor demonstrates remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and operational simplicity, offering a reliable and efficient analytical platform for precise HBP determination. Benefiting from its outstanding analytical performance, stability, and potential for device miniaturization, this sensing strategy shows significant promise for early sepsis diagnosis and broader clinical biomarker detection."
41608568,Nanobody Nb07 mitigates sepsis by blocking the PFKM-p53-PD-1 axis to enhance macrophage phagocytosis.,2026,"Rationale: Macrophage phagocytosis is essential for pathogen clearance during sepsis. We previously demonstrated that the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM), modulates macrophage functions and its deficiency alleviates sepsis in mice. However, the function of PFKM in regulating macrophage phagocytosis remains unclear. Methods: CD14(+) monocytes were sorted by flow cytometry from healthy volunteers and septic patients, and the subcellular localization of PFKM was assessed by immunofluorescence. Nuclear translocation mechanisms and PFKM-p53 interaction were identified by Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (Co-IP/MS) and validated by Co-IP. Transcriptomic sequencing was used to identify the downstream target of the PFKM-p53 complex. Inflammatory cytokine levels were detected by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, and the phagocytosis of macrophages was assessed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and ChIP were employed to investigate whether PFKM acts as a co-regulator of p53 in mediating Pdcd1 transcription. Nanobodies targeting PFKM-p53 were screened and subsequently synthesized according to the sequences. The effect of nuclear PFKM and the therapeutic effect of nanobodies were evaluated on the well-established sepsis mouse models induced by Escherichia coli or cecal ligation and puncture. Results: PFKM translocated to the macrophage nucleus during sepsis. Nuclear accumulation of PFKM impaired phagocytosis through a non-glycolytic ""moonlighting"" function and exacerbated sepsis. Mechanistically, PFKM interacts with p53, which facilitates its nuclear translocation. Subsequently, PFKM promotes p53 acetylation at K120, enhancing p53 binding to the Pdcd1 promoter and driving its transcription, thereby suppressing macrophage phagocytosis. Blocking the PFKM-p53 interaction with a nanobody, Nb07, restored phagocytosis of macrophages and alleviated sepsis in mice. Conclusion: Our data reveal the PFKM-p53-PD-1 axis that suppresses macrophage phagocytosis in sepsis and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway with nanobody-based strategies."
41608222,Endotoxin Hemoperfusion as an Adjuvant Therapy for Sepsis: Lessons from the TIGRIS Trial.,2025,"Despite significant advances in antimicrobial therapy and supportive intensive care, mortality in septic shock remains unacceptably high. Hemoadsorption therapies have emerged as adjunctive strategies designed to remove circulating mediators that propagate the dysregulated host response. Among these, polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) represents the most extensively studied extracorporeal modality, specifically targeting circulating endotoxin. Over three decades of investigation have produced a complex body of evidence, ranging from early promising results in small, open-label studies to large randomized trials with inconsistent outcomes. Recent findings from the TIGRIS trial, employing Bayesian design and biomarker-guided patient selection, provide compelling support for a survival benefit in a well-defined subgroup of septic shock patients with intermediate endotoxin activity. This review synthesizes the evolution of PMX-HP research, from EUPHAS through EUPHRATES and TIGRIS, highlighting lessons learned in trial design, biomarker utilization, and patient stratification. These experiences underscore the potential of precision-based extracorporeal interventions in sepsis while outlining the critical methodological and regulatory challenges that remain."
41607500,Influence of anesthetic agent and burst suppression on postoperative delirium in elderly patients: a prospective cohort study with automated EEG analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines currently suggest considering EEG guidance during general anesthesia in elderly patients to avoid prolonged burst suppression (BS), with the aim of mitigating postoperative delirium (POD). Our study aimed to investigate the association between POD and intraoperative BS duration dependent on the general anesthetic agent used (propofol vs. sevoflurane). METHODS: In this prospective study (2019-2022), EEGs from 265 patients over 70 years undergoing general anesthesia were analyzed for intraoperative BS duration both visually and using one new automated algorithm to evaluate its accuracy. Associations between BS duration, anesthetic agent, and postoperative delirium (POD) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: BS duration was markedly shorter than in prior cohorts but did not reduce overall postoperative delirium (POD) incidence. POD occurred more frequently with sevoflurane than propofol (44% vs. 30%, p = 0.017), despite shorter median BS [0 s (IQR 0-4.9) vs. 20.6 s (IQR 0-151.7); p = 0.012]. A significant interaction between anesthetic agent and BS (p = 0.033) showed that BS under sevoflurane conferred 3.8-fold greater POD risk than under propofol. Sevoflurane plus BS increased POD odds 9.3-fold compared to propofol without BS. Our new automated BS detection algorithm demonstrated high precision (median error <2.17 s). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane markedly increased POD risk versus propofol, independent of BS duration. Sevoflurane and BS interaction amplified delirium odds. BS appears a vulnerability marker rather than a causal factor. The validated machine-learning BS detector offers a reliable tool for future EEG-based delirium risk research."
41607142,The SMAD-Pathway Mediates HMGB1-Induced Proliferation and Metastatic Progression in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.,2026,"BACKGROUND: High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-binding protein involved in arthritis, ischemia, sepsis, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders, meningitis, and cancer. HMGB1 exhibits dual roles in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or oncoprotein depending on context. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to elucidate HMGB1's functional significance in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). METHODS: We overexpressed HMGB1 in cSCC cell lines using recombinant adenovirus and examined its effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed elevated HMGB1 expression levels in cSCC tissue relative to normal epidermis. To assess the influence of HMGB1, we employed recombinant adenoviruses expressing HMGB1 to transduce SCC cell lines (SCC12 and SCC13). Enhanced HMGB1 expression significantly promoted cellular proliferation and colony formation capacity. Notably, HMGB1 overexpression elevated the levels of proliferation regulators, including P63, SOX2, CDK4 and CDK6. Furthermore, HMGB1 overexpression substantially enhanced tumor invasiveness, accompanied by upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers. Mechanistically, overexpression of HMGB1 enhanced transforming growth factor-beta signaling by increasing phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, the key mediators of EMT. CONCLUSION: These data imply that HMGB1 acts as a tumor-promoting factor in cSCC."
41605076,Aluminum-copper layered double hydroxide-enabled electrochemiluminescence-multicolor dual-mode biosensor for heparin-binding protein detection in sepsis diagnosis.,2026,"Sepsis is a critical condition associated with substantial mortality, thus driving a pressing demand for rapid diagnostic approaches ranging from simple, readily deployable point-of-care testing (POCT) to highly sensitive laboratory-based detection methods. Heparin-binding protein (HBP), a neutrophil-derived protein, rises earlier and correlates more closely with disease severity than conventional biomarkers including procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, making it a promising biomarker for timely sepsis detection. To simultaneously meet these needs, we established a dual-mode biosensor that combines electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and multicolor for highly sensitive analysis of HBP. The sensing platform is constructed from an aluminum-copper layered double hydroxide (AlCu-LDH) scaffold conjugated with an HBP-specific aptamer and complementary DNA immobilized on magnetic beads (MBs). In the absence of HBP, the assembled AlCu-LDH-MBs probe suppresses ECL emission through ferrocene-mediated quenching while catalyzing efficient TMB oxidation to produce a strong multicolor response. Upon HBP binding, conformational switching induces probe disassembly, releasing AlCu-LDH and ferrocene from the duplex, thereby restoring ECL output while simultaneously attenuating the multicolor signal. Under optimized conditions, the biosensor achieved an ultralow detection limit of 0.023 pM in ECL mode with a linear range of 0.10 pM-10 nM, whereas the multicolor mode showed a detection limit of 0.43 nM and exhibited linearity across 0.50-10 nM, accompanied by an intuitive multicolor transition from gray to purple. Notably, this strategy avoids tedious electrode surface modification and relies on magnetic separation to regulate signal generation, thereby simplifying operation while offering a sensitive and practical tool for early sepsis diagnosis that bridges laboratory-grade analysis with instrument-free POCT."
41602763,Dysbiosis and metabolic pathway shifts in the gut microbiome of children with sepsis: a comparative analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The newly published Phoenix Sepsis Score in 2024 for assessing sepsis in children mainly focuses on respiratory, cardiological, coagulation and neurological indicators, whereas the gut microbiome also plays key roles in the occurrence and progression of sepsis. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific biomarkers in gut microbiome are associated with disease progression. This study aimed to explore the differences in gut microbiome diversity, composition and function between septic and healthy children, and to establish correlations with clinical indicators and outcomes, providing new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. RESULTS: Analysis of gut microbiome was performed in 20 sepsis children and 9 healthy controls aged between 3 and 18 years old. The anal swab samples were analyzed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Significant differences were observed in alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiome between sepsis group and healthy controls groups. Especially, Shannon diversity was significantly correlated with white blood cell count, serum lactate, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay and length of hospital stay (all R > 0, p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were both dominant in most of children in SG and HC groups, while three in SG showed extremely low combined abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (<10%), which might be associated with chemistry therapy and death outcome. Bacteria associated with nosocomial infections, including genus taxa Acinetobacter, Prevotella, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and Corynebacterium, can be dominant (relative abundance>70%) in sepsis group, which were absent in healthy control group. Enterococcus abundance not only predicted sepsis risk (AUC = 0.85) but also was correlated with 28-day mortality (R > 0, p = 0.004). Gene function prediction based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated significant differences profile in SG and sepsis-deaths groups. The enriched gut microbiome genes were related to cellular proliferation, energy metabolism, signal transduction, the oxidative stress response and arginine metabolism. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in diversity, taxa composition and gene function in the gut microbiome existed between septic and healthy children. The associations between gut microbiome dysbiosis and clinical indicators were identified. Enterococcus could be a biomarker to predict sepsis risk."
41602321,Risk factors for hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and ibuprofen treatment failure in premature twins: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Premature twins face a dual challenge: a high incidence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and a poor response to ibuprofen. Current management, derived from singleton data, fails to address this population's unique risks. Our study specifically investigates risk factors for hsPDA development and ibuprofen treatment failure in preterm twins to enable personalized prevention and therapy. Thus, the potential biomarkers for the occurrence of hsPDA and ibuprofen closure failure were examined. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective case-control study. 736 twin infants born at </=34 weeks of gestation were included, of which 70 were exposed to hsPDA and 66 were exposed to ibuprofen. Clinical data were obtained from the Electronic Medical Record system. For the occurrence of hsPDA and failure of ibuprofen treatment, multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the independent risk factor and the potential biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: 1. When compared to the non-hsPDA group, the hsPDA group demonstrated markedly higher incidences of low birth weight, lower gestational age, male gender, low 5 min Apgar scores, selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), use of pulmonary surfactant, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), >/=grade III intraventricular hemorrhage, and early-onset sepsis (p < 0.05). The hsPDA group had a notably higher rate of sIUGR (28.6%) relative to the non-hsPDA group (15.2%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, in twins with sIUGR, the larger infant exhibited a higher hsPDA incidence than the non-hsPDA group (p < 0.05). 2. Univariate analysis revealed that vaginal delivery, birth weight, gestational age, male gender, 5 min Apgar score, early-onset sepsis, RDS, and sIUGR were associated with the occurrence of hsPDA (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression identified sIUGR [odds ratio (OR) = 3.337, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.301-8.560] as an independent risk factor (IRF), while a higher birth weight (OR = 0.537, 95% CI 0.437-0.660) was noted to be a protective factor (p < 0.05). 3. Compared with the successful treatment group, the treatment failure group showed higher rates of premature rupture of membranes (PROMs) > 18 h, postnatal surfactant use, and monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins (p < 0.0167, Bonferroni correction). The treatment failure group included 11 MCDA cases (73.3%), markedly more than the successful treatment group (33.3%, p = 0.006). 4. Univariate regression analysis identified gestational age, birth weight, MCDA, 5 min Apgar score, and PROMs > 18 h as factors associated with ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression revealed MCDA (OR = 4.686, 95% CI 1.070-20.530) and PROMs > 18 h (OR = 15.198, 95% CI 2.377-97.178) as IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). 5. In the pharmacological closure group, MCDA twins exhibited markedly lower closure rates after both the first and total two courses compared to dichorionic diamniotic twins (p < 0.05). MCDA twins required higher cumulative drug doses (40.21 +/- 1.27 vs. 32.21 +/- 0.53, p < 0.05), although no significant difference in the frequency of administration was detected. The MCDA group also had a higher rate of surgical interventions (39.29% vs. 10.53%, p < 0.05). 6. The NT-proBNP, Hs-cTn, PGE2, Cortisol, and TXA2 levels in the sIUGR group were markedly elevated versus those in the non-sIUGR group, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In preterm twins </=34 weeks, sIUGR is an IRF for hsPDA. In addition, MCDA and PROMs > 18 h are IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure. Meanwhile, elevated levels of NT-proBNP and Hs-cTn may play a role in the development of hsPDA in preterm infants with sIUGR."
41599090,Kinetics of Biomarkers for Therapeutic Assessment in Swiss Mice Infected with a Virulent Trypanosoma cruzi Strain.,2026,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical illness affecting 6-8 million people in Latin America. Reaching scholarly consensus on the host response to T. cruzi infection remains a significant challenge, primarily due to substantial heterogeneity in outcomes driven by both the choice of animal model and the infecting parasite's discrete typing unit (DTU). This variability complicates the evaluation and comparison of new therapeutic compounds against existing drugs, namely benznidazole and nifurtimox. This study provides a comprehensive, kinetic, multifaceted characterization of the acute infection using the highly virulent T. cruzi Y strain (TcII) in outbred Swiss mice. Here, crucial infection parameters are presented, including the optimal infective dose, the parasitemia dynamics, tissue damage markers, hematological profiles, cytokine production (Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22), and molecular parasite identification in target organs (heart, colon, esophagus, spleen, and liver) across the span of the infection. The novelty of this study lies in the kinetic integration of these parameters within a defined model; rather than presenting isolated data points, we demonstrate how the biochemical, physiological, and clinical signs and immunological responses, with the resulting organ involvement, evolve and interact over time. To complete the report, a necropsy evaluation was performed at the end of the acute, fatal infection, and it is presented here. This study fulfills a long-standing recommendation from diverse drug discovery groups for the creation of a definitive reference model to standardize preclinical testing for anti-Chagasic agents."
41598793,Hospital-Wide Sepsis Detection: A Machine Learning Model Based on Prospectively Expert-Validated Cohort.,2026,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis detection remains challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and limitations of traditional scoring systems. This study developed and validated a hospital-wide machine learning model for sepsis detection using retrospectively developed data from prospectively expert-validated cases, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy beyond conventional approaches. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analysed 218,715 hospital episodes (2014-2018) at a tertiary care centre. Sepsis cases (n = 11,864, 5.42%) were prospectively validated in real-time by a Multidisciplinary Sepsis Unit using modified Sepsis-2 criteria with organ dysfunction. The model integrated structured data (26.95%) and unstructured clinical notes (73.04%) extracted via natural language processing from 2829 variables, selecting 230 relevant predictors. Thirty models including random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and gradient boosting were developed and evaluated. The dataset was randomly split (5/7 training, 2/7 testing) with preserved patient-level independence. Results: The BiAlert Sepsis model (random forest + Sepsis-2 ensemble) achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.93, and specificity of 0.84, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. Compared to the best rule-based method (Sepsis-2 + qSOFA, AUC-ROC 0.90), BiAlert reduced false positives by 39.6% (13.10% vs. 21.70%, p < 0.01). Novel predictors included eosinopenia and hypoalbuminemia, while traditional variables (MAP, GCS, platelets) showed minimal univariate association. The model received European Medicines Agency approval as a medical device in June 2024. Conclusions: This hospital-wide machine learning model, trained on prospectively expert-validated cases and integrating extensive NLP-derived features, demonstrates superior sepsis detection performance compared to conventional scoring systems. External validation and prospective clinical impact studies are needed before widespread implementation."
41598714,Machine Learning Model for Sepsis Prediction in Prolonged and Chronic Critical Illness: Development and Validation Using Retrospective Real-World ICU Data.,2026,"Background: No machine learning (ML) models for sepsis prediction have been specifically developed for patients with prolonged or chronic critical illness (PCI/CCI). Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based sepsis prediction model for this cohort. Methods: We analyzed ICU admissions from the Russian Intensive Care Dataset (RICD, 575 patients with PCI/CCI) and two public ICU datasets from the PhysioNet (>40,000 patients with acute critical illness). Models were trained within a right-aligned prediction framework using a case-crossover-control sampling approach and a 6 h prediction window. Two strategies were evaluated: (1) a PCI/CCI-focused model trained on RICD with external testing on PhysioNet data and (2) a universal model trained on combined RICD and PhysioNet cohorts. Models were developed with tree-based algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, AdaBoost), with internal and external validation. Primary outcome was model discrimination (AUROC). Subgroup analyses were performed for sepsis phenotypes. Results: The PCI/CCI-focused XGBoost model achieved an AUROC of 0.82 in the RICD cohort but failed to generalize to external ICU populations (AUROC 0.47). A universal model trained on mixed data demonstrated reduced discrimination in PCI/CCI patients (AUROC mean difference 0.02, p = 0.0012). Respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, and age were among the most important features. Predictive performance was higher in hypoinflammatory sepsis phenotype (AUROC 0.84 vs. 0.81 for hyperinflammatory, p < 0.001). Despite worthless positive predictive value (up to 21%) for PCI/CCI-focused model, negative predictive value exceeded 97%. Conclusions: A right-aligned ML model tailored to PCI/CCI demonstrated strong internal performance for sepsis exclusion but limited cross-population generalizability, underscoring the need for population-specific prediction models and prospective validation before clinical application."
41598305,"Chloremia Disturbances in Critical Care: A Narrative Review of Pathophysiology, Clinical Impact and Management Strategies.",2026,"Chloride, the leading extracellular anion, plays a crucial role in acid-base balance, fluid homeostasis, and neuromuscular function. Despite historical underrecognition, emerging evidence demonstrates significant associations between chloremia disturbances and critical care outcomes. This paper aims to narratively review the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management strategies of chloremia disturbances in critically ill patients. Chloremia disturbances are common in ICU patients, with both hypochloremia (<96 mEq/L) and hyperchloremia (>106 mEq/L) independently associated with increased mortality, prolonged ICU length of stay, and organ dysfunction. In sepsis, chloride levels exhibit a prognostic value, with threshold effects around 105 mEq/L. Hyperchloremia particularly increases acute kidney injury risk, while hypochloremia correlates with prolonged mechanical ventilation. The choice of resuscitation fluids significantly influences clinical outcomes, with balanced crystalloids potentially reducing adverse events if compared to normal saline solutions. Recent large-scale trials demonstrate lower rates of major adverse kidney events with chloride-restrictive strategies. Optimal management requires careful patient monitoring along with acid-base assessment. Treatment approaches must identify underlying causes to avoid complications. Prevention strategies include protocol-based fluid therapy, medication selection consideration, and early intervention in high-risk patients. Emerging technologies, including continuous monitoring systems and machine learning algorithms, offer promising advances for predicting and managing chloride disturbances."
41598217,Peak Lactate Within 24 h and Mortality in Septic Shock Patients Receiving Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Real-World Cohort from an Asian ICU (2018-2020).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Serum lactate is a key biomarker of tissue hypoperfusion and metabolic stress in sepsis. Although lactate clearance is widely recognized, many intensive care units record only a peak lactate within 24 h (pLac-24h). The prognostic value of pLac-24h among patients receiving blood purification therapy remains unclear in Asian intensive care settings. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 2018-2020 ICU dataset from MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Among 16,693 adult ICU admissions, 2506 patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as blood purification for severe sepsis or septic shock. Of these, 1264 (50.4%) had available pLac-24h data, and 27 (1.1%) also required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, APACHE II score, infection source, and CRRT/ECMO use. Discrimination was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision-curve analysis. This analysis was conducted as a predefined sub-analysis of an institutional ICU database. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 65.7 +/- 13.4 years, and 64.8% were male. Median pLac-24h was 5.1 mmol/L (IQR 3.2-8.6). The overall 28-day mortality among CRRT patients was 47.3%. Mortality rose progressively across pLac-24h quartiles (Q1-Q4: 28.9%, 39.4%, 54.7%, and 68.1%; p < 0.001). Each 1 mmol/L increase in pLac-24h independently predicted higher mortality (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.26, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for pLac-24h predicting 28-day mortality was 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), outperforming the APACHE II score (AUC 0.69, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with septic shock undergoing CRRT, peak lactate within 24 h was a strong, independent predictor of 28-day mortality. pLac-24h offers a pragmatic, readily available prognostic indicator when serial lactate measurements are unavailable, supporting its integration into bedside risk assessment in real-world Asian ICU practice."
41597508,"Clinical Characteristics, Microbiological Spectrum, Biomarkers, and Imaging Insights in Acute Pyelonephritis and Its Complicated Forms-A Systematic Review.",2026,"Background and Objectives: Acute and obstructive pyelonephritis (AOP) management, despite advancements in diagnostic imaging and antimicrobial therapy, is characterized by delayed recognition and increasing antimicrobial resistance. This review aimed to summarize current evidence regarding the clinical characteristics, microbiological spectrum, biomarkers, and imaging findings associated with AOP. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251162736). Literature searches were performed across the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 2014 and 31 March 2025 using the term ""acute obstructive pyelonephritis"". Inclusion criteria comprised original full-text English-language studies, published in the last 10 years and conducted in adults, reporting clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and imaging characteristics. Exclusion criteria are letters to the editor, expert opinions, case reports, conference or meeting abstracts, reviews, and redundant publications; having unclear or incomplete data; and being performed on cell cultures or on mammals. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. AOP predominantly affected elderly patients with comorbidities, especially diabetes mellitus and urinary tract obstruction. Predictors of septic shock included thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated procalcitonin (>1.12 microg/L), presepsin, and a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio >/= 8.7. Escherichia coli remained the leading pathogen (60-95%) with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates between 20 and 70%, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. CT demonstrated 71-100% sensitivity for detecting obstructive complications, confirming its superiority over ultrasound, while MRI provided comparable diagnostic accuracy in selected cases. Source control through double-J stenting or percutaneous drainage significantly improved survival. Conclusions: AOP requires prompt recognition and early decompression to prevent sepsis-related mortality. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin, presepsin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio enhance risk stratification, while CT remains the gold-standard imaging modality. The increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing pathogens underscores the need for antimicrobial stewardship and individualized therapeutic strategies guided by local resistance data."
41597487,Multi-Marker Approach in Sepsis: A Clinical Role Beyond SOFA Score.,2026,"Background and Objectives: Procalcitonin (PCT), presepsin (PSEP), interferon-lambda3 (IFN-lambda3), and bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) are promising sepsis biomarkers. We explored the clinical utility of a multi-marker approach using these four biomarkers in patients with suspected sepsis. Materials and Methods: In a total of 248 patients, the biomarkers were evaluated with the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed to diagnose sepsis and predict in-hospital mortality. Survival and reclassification analyses were also used to predict in-hospital mortality. Results: The four biomarkers showed comparable diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.61-0.95, p < 0.001-0.003), and sepsis proportion increased significantly as the number of biomarkers used in the multi-marker approach increased (7.7-91.7%, p < 0.001). The proportion of biomarker quartiles (Q1-Q4) differed significantly according to SOFA score (p < 0.001). The four biomarkers predicted in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.63-0.84, p < 0.001-0.004). The multi-marker approach performed better than the SOFA score (mortality rate, 58.3% vs. 31.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 14.7 vs. 4.6), and the addition of biomarkers to the SOFA score increased the performance. The multi-marker approach resulted in a higher HR in patients aged >/=75 years than in the overall population (9.2 vs. 4.2). Conclusions: Each biomarker showed clinical utility in patients with suspected sepsis. The multi-marker approach showed complementary clinical utility in addition to the SOFA score and better prognostic performance in patients aged >/=75 years. The use of biomarkers, alone or in combination, would be a valuable tool in combination with the SOFA score."
41597433,Sepsis Biomarkers in Evolution: Comparative Insights and the Promising Roles of MDW and Presepsin.,2026,"Background and Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early recognition is crucial to improve outcomes, but conventional biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) show limited diagnostic accuracy. Materials and Methods: We performed a narrative review of the literature on sepsis biomarkers, with a focus on their biological role, diagnostic performance, clinical applicability, and limitations. Particular attention was given to presepsin (P-SEP) and monocyte distribution width (MDW), which have recently gained relevance. Results: Several novel biomarkers-including lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Proenkephalin (PENK), and circulating microRNAs-have been studied, though most remain investigational. Among them, P-SEP shows rapid kinetics and correlation with disease severity, while MDW, derived from routine complete blood count, offers encouraging sensitivity and cost-effectiveness in emergency settings. Both biomarkers appear practical and potentially valuable for early sepsis detection. Conclusions: P-SEP and MDW emerge as the most promising biomarkers for timely sepsis recognition and risk stratification. Further validation and standardization are required to include them into routine clinical practice."
41596215,Predicting Sepsis in Heart Failure Patients Supported by Left Ventricular Assist Devices: The Role of VE-Cadherin and ADAM10.,2026,"Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cadherin) is a major endothelial adhesion molecule and can be cleaved explicitly by metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10). Vascular hyperpermeability may contribute to a greater susceptibility to sepsis in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support patients. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of VE-Cadherin and ADAM10 for predicting sepsis in LVAD patients. We prospectively recruited 50 patients with advanced heart failure receiving LVAD therapy. Baseline and weekly postoperative blood samples (weeks 1-4) were collected, and plasma VE-cadherin and ADAM10 levels were measured. Sepsis occurred in 9 of 50 patients (18.0%). Across all sampling points, plasma VE-cadherin and ADAM10 levels were significantly higher in the sepsis group relative to the non-sepsis group. From pre-implantation to 1-week and 1-month post-operation, VE-Cadherin alone showed good performance for sepsis prediction, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.75, 0.81, 0.69, 0.72, and 0.77, respectively. A significant positive correlation between VE-cadherin and ADAM10 was detected only among sepsis patients. Incorporating ADAM10 into the prediction models significantly enhances their predictive performance. Plasma VE-Cadherin levels can be a valuable biomarker for predicting sepsis in LVAD patients, with predictive performance further enhanced when combined with circulating ADAM10 levels."
41596113,"Phagocyte NADPH Oxidase NOX2-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Antimicrobial Defense: Mechanisms, Regulation, and Therapeutic Potential-A Narrative Review.",2025,"ROS derived from NADPH oxidase, particularly NOX2, are central to antimicrobial defense, coupling direct pathogen killing with redox signaling that shapes inflammation. This narrative review integrates recent advances on NOX2 structure, assembly, and spatiotemporal control in phagocytes, and outlines how ROS interact with NF-kappaB, MAPK, and Nrf2 networks to coordinate microbicidal activity and immune modulation. We summarize evidence that both ROS deficiency, as in chronic granulomatous disease, and uncontrolled excess, as in sepsis and severe COVID-19, drive clinically significant pathology, emphasizing the need for precise redox balance. Emerging therapeutic strategies include selective NOX2 inhibitors that limit pathological oxidative bursts, redox-modulating peptides that disrupt upstream activation cues, and Nrf2 activators that enhance endogenous antioxidant capacity, with attention to dosing challenges that preserve host defense while mitigating tissue injury. Key gaps remain in biomarker standardization, real-time in vivo ROS monitoring, and translation from animal models to patients, motivating personalized, combination approaches to redox medicine in infectious diseases."
41595745,Predictive Value of Platelet-Based Indexes for Mortality in Sepsis.,2026,"Background: Even though there have been improvements in antimicrobial and supportive therapies, sepsis and septic shock are still major causes of death in intensive care units. Early prognostic stratification is very important for helping doctors make decisions. Platelet-derived indices may provide useful, low-cost indicators that signify both inflammatory activation and coagulation irregularities. This study looked at how well different platelet-based ratios could predict death in the hospital from sepsis. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective observational study spanning one year in a tertiary ICU, enrolling 114 adult patients diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock. Upon admission, four platelet-related biomarkers were measured: the C-reactive protein-to-platelet ratio (CPR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PWR), and the platelet-to-creatinine ratio (PCR). Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were employed to assess predictive accuracy. Results: Compared to survivors, non-survivors (n = 39) had much higher CRP levels and CPR values, alongside lower platelet and lymphocyte counts. The CPR index showed the best ability in differentiating between non-survivors and survivors (AUC 0.757), with a best cutoff of 0.886. In simplified multivariate models, CPR was still an independent predictor of death in the hospital (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.22-3.21), whereas PLR and PWR were not. PCR showed a non-significant trend toward lower values in not survivors. Conclusions: CPR is a strong and clinically viable predictor of early mortality in sepsis, outperforming other platelet-based indices. Derived from routine laboratory parameters, CPR serves as a valuable adjunct for initial risk stratification in the ICU. To further confirm its prognostic role and incorporation into current scoring systems, large-scale multicenter studies with longitudinal measurements are warranted to validate its prognostic utility and integration into existing scoring systems."
41593846,Prognostic Significance of the Prothrombin Time-international Normalized Ratio to Albumin Ratio in Cancer patients with complication of Sepsis: A Retrospectively Cohort Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence supports the use of the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio-to-albumin ratio (PTAR) as a prognostic biomarker in various diseases. This study evaluated whether PTAR, an easily measurable index, predicts short- and long-term all-cause mortality in cancer patients with sepsis (cancer sepsis). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from 1,584 adult cancer-sepsis patients in the ICU from the MIMIC-IV database (v3.1) and 82 patients from a Chinese tertiary oncology hospital. Mortality at 28 and 365 days was analyzed using multivariable Cox models, restricted cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier curves, and subgroup analyses. Discriminatory performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), comparing PTAR with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, international normalized ratio (INR), and serum albumin (ALB). AUC differences were tested using DeLong's test. RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV cohort, patients in the highest PTAR quartile (Q4) had significantly higher risks of 28-day (adjusted HR = 2.038) and 365-day mortality (adjusted HR = 1.615). PTAR showed superior discrimination compared to the SOFA score and INR at both time points. In the Chinese cohort, PTAR also predicted 28-day mortality (adjusted HR = 4.682), with better AUC (0.721) than SOFA (0.564). CONCLUSIONS: PTAR at ICU admission independently predicts 28-day mortality in cancer patients with sepsis in both the MIMIC-IV and Chinese cohorts, outperforming SOFA and INR. The 365-day mortality was validated only in the MIMIC-IV cohort, where PTAR demonstrated stronger predictive performance compared to INR and SOFA. Therefore, PTAR can serve as a complementary biomarker to be used in conjunction with existing clinical scoring systems and laboratory indicators, providing additional risk assessment information for cancer-sepsis."
41593637,Endothelial glycocalyx degradation and its association with clinical outcomes and host response aberrations in community-acquired pneumonia across different care settings.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial glycocalyx degradation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Previous studies linked elevated plasma syndecan-1, an established biomarker of glycocalyx disruption, to mortality in sepsis. We aimed to determine the association of plasma syndecan-1 levels with clinical outcomes and host response changes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with various disease severities. METHODS: We included CAP patients upon presentation in three care settings: emergency department (ED), general ward, and intensive care unit (ICU). We stratified patients in a Normal-Syndecan-1 and an Elevated-Syndecan-1 group based on syndecan-1 levels measured in outpatient controls without infection, and measured 32 biomarkers reflective of five pathophysiological domains involved in sepsis immunopathology: coagulation activation, endothelial cell activation and dysfunction, cytokines, neutrophil degranulation, systemic inflammation and organ damage. We analyzed blood transcriptomes to obtain insight in changes in host response pathways in circulating leukocytes related with glycocalyx disruption. RESULTS: We included 50 non-infectious control patients and 384 CAP patients, with samples collected from 95 in the ED, 124 after admission to the general ward, and 165 after admission to the ICU. The Elevated-Syndecan-1 group showed significantly reduced 30-day survival compared to the Normal-Syndecan-1 group (log-rank p < 0.05). The relationship between syndecan-1 (continuous variable) and 30-day mortality was non-linear and independent of comorbidities and disease severity. Most biomarkers were already strongly elevated in the Normal-Syndecan-1 group relative to non-infectious controls, spanning all pathophysiological domains. All biomarkers showed further increases in the Elevated-Syndecan-1 group relative to non-infectious controls, which was also reflected in direct comparisons between the Normal-Syndecan-1 and Elevated-Syndecan-1 groups. Gene set enrichment analysis of blood leukocytes indicated a link between elevated syndecan-1 and increased expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Glycocalyx degradation, as measured by plasma syndecan-1, shows a non-linear association with mortality in patients with CAP. Key systemic host response changes implicated in sepsis pathogenesis occur prior to detectable glycocalyx degradation in this population.

41591761,Enhanced Clearance of HIV-1 Broadly Neutralizing Antibody VRC07-523-LS During Viremia: Influences on Trial Design and Analysis.,2026,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAb) are capable of neutralizing multiple HIV-1 strains through the targeting of conserved epitopes. This study's objective was to quantify the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters describing the distribution and elimination of the BNAb VRC07-523-LS in people with HIV (PWH), and to identify the influence of viral load on VRC07-523-LS elimination. The PK of VRC07-523-LS was assessed in participants with and without HIV after intravenous or subcutaneous administration. A Bayesian strategy was utilized to estimate VRC07-523-LS PK parameters, leveraging a previously published study in adults without HIV. The effects of static viral loads on VRC07-523-LS exposure and time to a target trough serum concentration of 1 mg/L was then evaluated using clinical trial simulations. VRC07-523-LS serum concentrations were described by a two-compartment model with first order absorption from the subcutaneous site. Typical clearance was estimated as 99.3 mL/day, which increased to a maximum of 6.46-fold higher with viremia. Clinical trial simulations without viremia showed that a 700-2100 mg dose of VRC07-523-LS is expected to remain above the IC(50) of 0.055 mg/L beyond 52 weeks. With a viral load of 30,000 copies/mL, a 2100 mg dose of VRC07-523-LS is expected to result in 90% of participants having a concentration below 1 mg/L by 18.6 weeks, a decrease of 42 weeks compared to aviremic patients. Mechanistic modeling offers the ability to identify HIV viral load effects on BNAb PK and can improve BNAb dosing, especially with consideration of acute versus maintenance treatment."

Recent advances in benchtop NMR technology have sought to overcome these barriers by providing more compact, affordable, and user-friendly instruments. This systematic review aims to assess the potential of benchtop NMR in clinical metabolomics, highlighting its practical advantages, current applications, and technological challenges relative to high-field systems. Methods: For this systematic review we searched Web of Science and PubMed databases to identify studies employing benchtop NMR spectroscopy in clinical and biomedical applications. The review focuses on works that evaluated metabolic profiling in human and animal disease contexts, compared benchtop and high-field performance, and utilized advanced data analysis methods, including multivariate and machine learning approaches. Results: Among the 74 records identified, 15 research articles were eligible, including 11 studies involving human biospecimens and 4 studies concerning animal samples. The selected works were published between 2018 and 2025. These studies demonstrated the potential clinical utility of low-field NMR in differentiating disease states such as tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, neonatal sepsis, and chronic kidney disease, achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to high-field instruments. Conclusions: Although limited by lower sensitivity and spectral resolution, benchtop NMR represents a significant step toward the democratization of NMR-based metabolomics. Continued hardware development, improved pulse sequences, and the integration of artificial intelligence for spectral processing and modeling are expected to enhance its analytical power and accelerate its clinical adoption."
41590545,Beyond Oral Health: Personalized Strategies for Managing Oral Infections in Neutropenic Patients.,2026,"Oral infections in neutropenic patients are an underestimated but likely fatal cause of infectious complications, with clinical manifestations often diminished or absent due to immune deficiency. The evaluation and management of these infections requires a personalized multidisciplinary strategy, including prevention through pre-therapy dental assessment, individualized oral hygiene protocols, and rapid treatment of dental lesions. Antimicrobial strategies should be adapted not only to the local resistance profile and individual risk, with a priority on antibiotic stewardship and rapid de-escalation when possible, but also to individual patterns of colonization and comorbidities. Dental procedures can be performed without risk in neutropenic patients with a low complication rate, but further studies are key to stratifying risk. Future research directions include the application of artificial intelligence for infectious risk stratification, the use of salivary or microbiome biomarkers for early detection, and the development of innovative technologies for targeted antimicrobial delivery. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the common clinical manifestations in neutropenic patients and also the potential progression of dental infections into sepsis in this category of patients."
41590521,Artificial Intelligence- and Machine Learning-Assisted Subphenotyping for Personalized Immunotherapy in Sepsis.,2026,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis heterogeneity limits advances in immunotherapy. Increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) attempts to turn multi-dimensional data into meaningful clusters, indicating biological mechanisms. We provide an overview of the existing evidence on AI-derived sepsis subtyping, exploring treatment response to available immune modulating therapies. Methods: On 1 October 2025, we conducted a structured search on all relative publications on MEDLINE and undertook a narrative review. Results: Multiple subphenotyping algorithms were identified, using clinical, biological, and omics data, across different cohorts, mainly through secondary analyses of randomized trials. The main classification was between hyper- and hypoinflammatory subphenotypes. Statins, corticosteroids, activated protein C, or thrombomodulin displayed differential effects on the outcome of these subphenotypes. Conclusions: Further research is required to prospectively validate findings and to offer pragmatic solutions to patients who need them the most. Issues of validity, equity, ethics, and feasibility are discussed."
41587020,Patient Benefits in the Context of Sepsis-Related AI-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems: Scoping Review.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Global digitalization continues to advance, extending its influence into medicine and health care systems worldwide. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the research and development of artificial intelligence (AI), raising questions about its potential in medicine. The integration and application of AI in intensive care medicine, particularly in sepsis treatment, presents significant potential for advancing patient outcomes and enhancing patient-relevant benefits. However, a comprehensive and systematic overview of the full spectrum of patient-relevant benefits associated with AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) remains lacking. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify and categorize evidence on patient-relevant benefits of AI-based CDSS in sepsis care. METHODS: Systematic research was conducted in 4 electronic databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, the ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. In addition, a comprehensive search on the websites of relevant international organizations, along with a citation search of the included articles, was conducted. Articles were included if they (1) focused on sepsis and (2) described patient-relevant benefits of AI-based CDSS. Articles published between January 1, 2008, and March 2, 2023, were considered for inclusion. Study selection was performed independently by 2 reviewers. The manuscript was drafted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. The analysis of the included articles was conducted using the program MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH), with systemization finalized in a consensus workshop. RESULTS: A total of 3368 records were identified across the 4 databases, of which 24 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review. The additional search on international websites and in reference lists identified 6 more relevant articles, resulting in 30 included studies. Of these, 20 were quantitative, comprising 7 prospective and 13 retrospective designs. In addition, 1 qualitative study, 1 mixed methods study, 6 review articles, and 2 articles from institutional websites were included. Patient-relevant benefits were systematized in six main categories: (1) prediction, (2) earlier treatment and prioritization of high-risk patients, (3) individualized therapy, (4) improved patient outcomes (including improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, reduced length of stay, and reduced mortality), (5) general improvements in care, and (6) reduced readmission rate. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review underscores the potential of AI-based CDSS to positively impact patient-relevant benefits, particularly in sepsis care, where they demonstrate considerable promise for improving intensive care. However, the majority of the identified studies rely on retrospective database analyses. Future research should focus on validating these findings through prospective studies."
41586317,Early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of secondary bloodstream infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii in critically ill patients by machine-learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Secondary bloodstream infections (sBSI) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) are a major threat to patient safety in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to their prevalence and severity. Developing accurate predictive models is crucial for enhancing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to leverage machine learning (ML) to create a diagnostic model for predicting the risk of AB-sBSI in ICU patients and a prognostic model for assessing the associated 30-day mortality risk. METHODS: The multicenter, retrospective study enrolled 4,267 ICU patients with AB isolated from non-blood sites. Of these, 337 patients developed bloodstream infection. The analysis included 70 patients with confirmed AB secondary bloodstream infection (AB-sBSI) and 76 age and sex matched controls with non AB-sBSI. For 30-day mortality assessment, the AB-sBSI patients were categorized into non-survivors (n=39) and survivors (n=31). Demographic, microbiological, and laboratory data encompassing hematological, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were analyzed. Fourteen machine learning models were evaluated using the Deepwise and Beckman Coulter DxAI platforms with five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using five standard metrics, and the DeLong test was applied for AUC comparison. After data preprocessing, patients were enrolled to form an external validation cohort. RESULTS: The AB-sBSI risk diagnosis model, constructed with 11 features, identified red cell distribution width as the most significant predictor. The AdaBoost model outperformed both comparative models (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC) and the conventional biomarker C-reactive protein (AUC = 0.66), with AUCs of 0.937 in training and 0.786 in validation. For 30-day mortality prediction, another model based on 11 features selected lymphocyte count as the most influential variable. The AdaBoost model showed prominent efficacy, surpassing other model (Multilayer Perceptron, BernoulliNB, SGD) and achieving AUC values of 0.986 in training and 0.821 in validation. CONCLUSION: We developed two ML based models for predicting AB-sBSI risk and 30-day mortality. As a preliminary exploration, both models have been converted into accessible web tools. These tools are designed to assist clinicians in making informed decisions and promptly adjusting treatment strategies for critically ill patients."
41585697,Folic Acid Targeting Shared Sepsis-Osteoporosis Pathogenesis: From Computational Discovery to Dynamic Binding Mechanisms.,2026,"Sepsis and osteoporosis (OP) are two common diseases that have a significant impact on public health. This study aims to elucidate the common genetic factors and molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between sepsis and osteoporosis and to explore novel treatment methods. We employed a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, utilizing gene expression data from multiple human databases. This approach included differential expression analysis, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), enrichment analysis, machine learning, immune infiltration analysis, and molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Our study identified four key genes, CTSD, RNASE2, KYNU, and CX3CR1, that are associated with both sepsis and OP. Functional enrichment analysis revealed significant connections to immune processes and signaling pathways, including autophagy and the IL-17 signaling pathway. A nomogram constructed from these four genes demonstrated a strong diagnostic performance for OP, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.797 (95%CI: 0.712-0.882). Additionally, the validation data set for sepsis demonstrated an even higher AUC of 0.903 (95%CI: 0.825-0.980). Moreover, the immune infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between these key genes and various immune cell types, suggesting that modulating the immune cell activity could be a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, molecular docking studies identified folic acid as a promising therapeutic candidate for both sepsis and OP due to its strong binding affinity with the protein products of the four key genes. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stability of these binding interactions. This research offers important insights into the common genetic framework linking sepsis and osteoporosis. It integrates bioinformatics and molecular simulations to decipher the protective role of folic acid in sepsis and osteoporosis."
41585247,Maternal inflammatory biomarkers and neonatal characteristics as predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Maternal peripartum inflammation may contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, yet readily available hematologic predictors are underexplored. We evaluated whether the maternal platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PWR) within 24 h before delivery, together with neonatal clinical variables, predicts BPD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary NICU in Southwest China, including all eligible mother-infant pairs with preterm birth (<37 weeks) between June 2020 and June 2024. BPD was defined per the 2018 NICHD criteria. Maternal demographics, obstetric complications, hematology (WBC, PLT, PWR, NLR, and PLR), and neonatal characteristics (gestational age, birth weight, sex, Apgar score, SGA, sepsis, and respiratory support) were abstracted from electronic records. Variables with p < 0.10 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by AUC, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, bootstrap calibration, and a nomogram was constructed. RESULTS: Among 345 pairs, 117 infants (33.9%) developed BPD. Mothers of BPD infants had higher WBC and lower PLT, yielding a lower PWR (median 18.9 vs. 23.1, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, lower maternal PWR independently predicted BPD (aOR = 0.94 per unit increase; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; p = 0.002). Additional independent predictors included chorioamnionitis (aOR = 1.94; 1.01-3.71; p = 0.046), male sex (aOR = 1.61; 1.00-2.59; p = 0.049), early-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.45; 1.04-5.77; p = 0.040), late-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.86; 1.47-5.56; p = 0.002), and mechanical ventilation >7 days (aOR = 6.74; 3.34-13.62; p < 0.001). Gestational age and birth weight were protective (per week: aOR = 0.68; 0.58-0.79; p < 0.001; per 100 g: aOR = 0.86; 0.78-0.94; p = 0.001). The final model showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.866; 95% CI, 0.827-0.905) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi (2) = 10.833, p = 0.211; bootstrap slope = 0.98). At the optimal probability threshold (0.763), sensitivity was 77.2% and specificity was 80.9%. A nomogram enables individualized risk estimation. CONCLUSION: A lower maternal PWR measured immediately before delivery, alongside established neonatal risk factors, independently predicts BPD in preterm infants. This simple hematologic marker, integrated into a nomogram, may facilitate early identification and targeted prevention strategies in high-risk dyads."
41585235,Association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is defined as the admission blood glucose level divided by the estimated average glucose derived from glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Previous studies have demonstrated that higher SHR levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the relationship between SHR and mortality risk specifically in patients with sepsis remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association between SHR and all-cause mortality among adult ICU patients with sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effects model was employed to pool relative risks (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 18.0. RESULTS: A total of 11 retrospective cohort studies comprising 37,790 participants were included. Pooled analyses showed that higher SHR levels were significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.79-2.50; I (2) = 36.3%), short-term mortality (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.77; I (2) = 0%), and long-term mortality (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.40-1.65; I (2) = 10.3%). Subgroup analyses based on follow-up duration (60 days, 90 days, and 1 year) revealed no statistically significant differences in effect size (p = 0.511), suggesting that follow-up duration was not a major source of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis indicated that studies with a higher proportion of diabetic patients showed a stronger association between SHR and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.026). The overall methodological quality of the included studies was high. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated SHR is an independent predictor of in-hospital, short-term, and long-term all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis. SHR, as a simple and valuable prognostic biomarker, may aid in early risk stratification of patients with sepsis.

41583950,"Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of Interleukin-6, C-reactive Protein, and Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells(-1), Individually and Combined, in Differentiating Candidemia from Bacteremia in Intensive Care Unit Patients.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Differentiating candidemia from bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is critical for effective treatment but is often delayed by reliance on conventional diagnostics like blood cultures. This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells(-1) (sTREM-1), individually and in combination, for distinguishing these bloodstream infections (BSIs). METHODS: This prospective observational study included 74 ICU patients with BSIs admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between September 2023 and August 2024. Biomarker levels were measured on the 2(nd) day of ICU admission. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients, 54 (72.9%) had bacteremia and 20 (27.1%) had candidemia. IL-6 and sTREM-1 levels were significantly higher in candidemia (P < 0.001), whereas CRP alone did not show discriminatory power (P = 0.981). The combined biomarker model achieved an area under the curve of 0.818, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance compared to individual markers. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and sTREM-1 are effective biomarkers for distinguishing candidemia from bacteremia, with CRP providing additional value in a multibiomarker model. This approach may enhance diagnostic precision and improve clinical decision-making in ICU settings."
41582389,The Mediating Role of Immune Cells in the Genetically Predicted Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Puerperal Sepsis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The causal relationship between gut microbiota and puerperal sepsis (PS) remains unclear, and there is a lack of in-depth research regarding the potential mediating role of immune cells in this context. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PS using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and to assess the mediating effects of immune cells on the risk of PS onset through mediation analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 473 gut microbiota species, 731 immune cell phenotypes, and PS datasets. Univariate MR (UVMR) analysis was employed to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PS, with the primary statistical method being inverse variance weighting (IVW). Multiple statistical models were applied for sensitivity analysis to minimize the confounding effects of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Subsequently, a two-step mediation MR analysis was conducted to evaluate whether immune cells mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and PS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Analysis using various statistical models indicated that 11 gut microbiota species (e.g., Azorhizobiume, Bacillus velezensis, CAG-245 sp000435175, Lentimicrobiaceae, and Providencia) exhibited a causal relationship with PS. Further reverse causal analysis between PS and gut microbiota ruled out the possibility of reverse causality. The two-step mediation MR analysis demonstrated that the percentage of IgD-CD27- B cells (10.26%) and CD62L- monocytes (17.29%) partially mediated the effect of CAG-245 sp000435175 on PS risk. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between the abundance of certain gut microbiota species and PS, while also revealing a potential mediating role of immune cells. These findings offer valuable theoretical insights into personalized treatment strategies and the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers for PS."
41580950,Troponins and echocardiography: role in detecting myocardial injury in burn patients.,2026,"Severe burn injuries result in a massive systemic inflammatory and hypermetabolic response, often disrupting multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. Cardiac troponins are frequently elevated in burn patients, but the interpretation of these elevations is hardly straightforward. Sometimes, elevated troponin means type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to an acute coronary event, but it might also reflect type 2 MI due to an imbalance between body oxygen demand and supply, or even non-ischemic myocardial injury from things like overwhelming inflammation, sepsis, or direct thermal effects on the heart itself. This narrative review explores the prevalence, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic challenges, and prognostic implications of troponin elevation in burn patients. We discussed the limitations of applying conventional MI diagnostic criteria in this unique population. The role of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic assessment, as well as the potential utility of high-sensitivity troponin assays, is also discussed. Understanding of how burn pathophysiology relates to myocardial injury is essential for accurate diagnosis, improved management, and better outcomes in this highly vulnerable group of patients."
41580662,Coagulation risk in sepsis patients with elevated lactate-to-albumin ratio: a retrospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is commonly observed in patients with sepsis and is correlated with an elevated risk of mortality. The objective of this study is to analyse the association between the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and the occurrence of SIC, as well as all-cause mortality. METHODS: From the MIMIC-IV3.1 database, patients with sepsis who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected. The relationship between LAR and SIC was assessed by constructing a multivariate logistic regression model and performing Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. To evaluate the predictive ability of different biomarkers for SIC, we performed ROC curve analysis. Subgroup analysis verifies the robustness of the results. Additionally, Cox regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between LAR and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 8,661 patients with sepsis were included in the final analysis, of whom 5,784 developed SIC. In the comprehensive logistic regression model, each additional unit of LAR increased the odds of SIC rather by 1.85 (OR, 2.85, 95% CI, 2.48-3.28; p < 0.001). The odds of SIC rather in the highest LAR group was significantly increased (T3 vs T1: OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.06-4.17; p < 0.001). The relationship between LAR levels and SIC incidence was found to be nonlinear and positive, as revealed by RCS analysis. ROC analysis indicated superior predictive performance of LAR (AUC = 0.71) compared to albumin (AUC = 0.61) or lactate (AUC = 0.69). Subgroup analysis indicates a stable relationship between LAR and SIC. Moreover, an increase in LAR was correlated with a heightened risk of mortality at both 28 days and 360 days (28-d HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.19; 360-d HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.18; all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Observational findings indicate that elevated early LAR levels may be associated with increased rates of SIC and all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis. However, further prospective studies are needed to validate these associations and assess their clinical utility."
41580617,Biomarkers and clinical rules for the management of mild traumatic brain injury: a narrative review.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for 80% of TBI cases. Although only 16% show intracranial lesions and <1% require neurosurgical intervention, CT overutilization remains common. Clinical decision rules like the Canadian CT Head Rule achieve high sensitivity ( approximately 100%) but poor specificity (28-65%). Serum biomarkers, particularly GFAP and UCH-L1, offer complementary diagnostic performance. Emerging evidence suggests combining both strategies may optimize diagnostic accuracy, though integrated approaches remain poorly characterized in the literature. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of literature published January 2000-March 2025 across PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Scielo. Search terms included mTBI, biomarkers (GFAP, UCH-L1, S100B), clinical decision rules (Canadian CT Head Rule, New Orleans Criteria, NEXUS), and resource-limited settings. Inclusion criteria comprised observational cohorts, clinical trials, validation studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses focused on mTBI in emergency contexts. RESULTS: Combined strategies integrating clinical decision rules with biomarkers achieved superior diagnostic performance compared to either tool individually. The Canadian CT Head Rule demonstrated optimal performance across GCS 13-15 (sensitivity 93-100% and specificity 28-65% for intracranial lesions). GFAP demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared with UCH-L1 and S100B. Although UCH-L1 did not provide meaningful incremental value beyond GFAP alone, all currently FDA- and CE-cleared platforms for clinical use (Abbott i-STAT, Alinity i; bioMerieux VIDAS(R) TBI) measure both GFAP and UCH-L1 in combination, achieving sensitivities of 95.8-97.3% and specificities of 34.2-41.2%. CONCLUSION: Integrating the Canadian CT Head Rule with GFAP-based biomarker testing may optimize CT utilization in mTBI. We propose a sequential diagnostic algorithm consisting of initial evaluation with the Canadian CT Head Rule, followed by biomarker testing in CCHR-positive cases, with CT reserved for biomarker-positive patients. This stepwise approach has the potential to support more efficient referral decisions and resource utilization in settings with limited access to neuroimaging, while reducing unnecessary brain CT use in centers with imaging availability, adapting to diverse healthcare contexts. Cost-effectiveness analyses and validation in resource-limited environments remain needed."
41580574,Comparison of creatinine- and cystatin C-based definitions of acute kidney injury in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill neonates and is associated with adverse outcomes. Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) are particularly vulnerable due to pulmonary hypoplasia, hemodynamic instability, and exposure to nephrotoxic agents. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 193 neonates with CDH treated at a tertiary referral center (2012-2021). AKI was graded using modified pediatric RIFLE (pRIFLE), neonatal KDIGO (nKDIGO), and CysC-based neonatal AKI (CyNA) criteria, disregarding the urine output criteria. Clinical variables included CDH severity, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use, and sepsis. Associations with AKI were examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: AKI incidence varied significantly by definition (CyNA 82% > pRIFLE 78% > nKDIGO 56%; CyNA vs. pRIFLE/nKDIGO p = 0.028/p = 0.010). Moderate AKI was detected in 61% (CyNA), 38% (pRIFLE), and 26% (nKDIGO) of the cases. Severe AKI was detected in 42% (pRIFLE), 30% (nKDIGO), and 20% (CyNA) of the cases. Severe CyNA was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.003). The severity of AKI was associated with a stepwise increase in mortality (mild/moderate vs. severe, p < 0.01), as well as prolonged hospitalization, kidney replacement therapy, and hypertension at discharge. Independent risk factors for AKI included lower observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio, sepsis, and ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is a frequent and clinically important complication in neonates with CDH and is strongly associated with overall disease severity, incidence of sepsis, and ECMO. Neonates with severe AKI have a higher mortality. CysC might serve as an additional biomarker for the detection of neonates with CDH and fatal outcome. Future studies should assess whether integrating both serum creatinine and CysC into AKI monitoring improves the early detection of neonates with CDH at risk of acute and chronic kidney disease."
41579501,Long-term outcomes of abnormal global longitudinal left ventricular strain during sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis survivors often face long-term cardiovascular complications, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), potentially linked to septic cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) is a sensitive marker of cardiac dysfunction and a predictor of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether cardiac dysfunction measured by LV GLS is an independent predictor of MACE in septic patients. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective open cohort study included 439 patients hospitalized with sepsis or septic shock between 2018 and 2022. LV systolic function was assessed using LV GLS and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) within seven days of admission. Patients were followed until July 2024. Restricted cubic spline Cox regression models examined non-linear associations between LV GLS, LVEF, and MACE. Additionally, Cox regression models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and sepsis severity markers evaluated whether LV systolic dysfunction, defined as high LV GLS (> -16) or low LVEF, were predictors of MACE. RESULTS: During the study period, 439 septic patients were included, totaling 595 patient-years of follow-up. Among them, 254 experienced MACE. LV GLS exhibited a non-linear association with MACE, with values between -23 and - 16 associated with the lowest risk. High LV GLS was independently associated with MACE (unadjusted HR: 1.4 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.8; p = 0.01]; adjusted HR 1.38 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.9; p = 0.04]). In contrast, low LVEF was not associated with MACE (unadjusted HR 1.2 [95% CI: 0.9, 1.5; p = 0.2]; adjusted HR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.73, 1.45; p = 0.8]). CONCLUSIONS: LV GLS was an independent predictor of MACE in septic patients, whereas LVEF did not show a significant association. These findings suggest that LV GLS may be a valuable biomarker for long-term cardiovascular risk stratification in this population."
41578542,Salvaging sepsis-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome with terminal complement blockade: A case report.,2026,"RATIONALE: Sepsis can trigger life-threatening atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) through dysregulated complement activation. Diagnosis is challenging due to overlapping features with septic shock, often leading to delayed recognition and high mortality. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-year-old female with chronic kidney disease presented with a 3-day history of productive cough, fever, and progressive dyspnea, which rapidly escalated to respiratory failure, anuria, and coma within 24 hours. DIAGNOSES: Laboratory findings confirmed thrombotic microangiopathy (hemoglobin 57 g/L, platelets 69 x 109/L, schistocytes 0.3%, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] 469 U/L) and acute kidney injury (creatinine 535 micromol/L). The diagnosis of complement-mediated aHUS was established by markedly elevated soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9) (578 ng/mL) with preserved a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 activity (89%). INTERVENTIONS: Critical care included mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy. Specific aHUS therapy comprised plasma exchange (10 sessions) and complement blockade with eculizumab (900 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks), accompanied by meningococcal prophylaxis. OUTCOMES: By day 31, hematologic and renal parameters improved (platelets 72 x 109/L, LDH 273 U/L, creatinine 151 micromol/L). By day 51, complement activity normalized (sC5b-9 261 ng/mL, a 54.8% reduction), with full hematologic recovery (platelets 198 x 109/L, LDH 171 U/L), renal function near baseline (creatinine 96 micromol/L), and resolution of hemolysis. LESSONS: In sepsis with persistent thrombocytopenia despite infection control, urgent sC5b-9 testing is critical to diagnose aHUS. Eculizumab, combined with supportive continuous renal replacement therapy and plasma exchange, can effectively reverse multi-organ failure even during active bacteremia, with serial sC5b-9 monitoring serving as a key biomarker for guiding therapy."
41576601,Efficacy of fresh frozen plasma immunotherapy as an adjuvant treatment of neonatal sepsis in puppies.,2026,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fresh frozen plasma (passive immunotherapy) on clinical and laboratorial findings in puppies treated for neonatal sepsis. A total of thirty-one puppies were included in this study, 16 were diagnosed with sepsis and treated either with plasma + antibiotic (plasma group, n = 7; PG) or antibiotic only (control group, n = 9; CG); whereas 15 were healthy neonates (HG). The groups were evaluated at the first appointment (M0), after 24 (M24), 48 (M48), 72 h (M72) and at the end of treatment (ME). At M0, neonates with sepsis presented a reduction (p < 0.05) in heart rate (HR), reflexes, blood glucose, body temperature, and leukocytes (leukopenia), with an increase (p < 0.05) in lactate and troponin I, compared to HG puppies. During treatment, significant improvement of laboratory parameters was observed in PG compared to CG puppies, with higher IgM level at M24, and higher blood glucose and leukocyte count at M24 and M48 (p < 0.05). At ME, the lactate was lower in PG than CG puppies (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the serum IgG or IgA concentrations among groups. Evaluating clinical and laboratory improvement between time points within the same group, differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the PG puppies, which increased blood glucose, temperature, leukocytes count, and IgM at M24 compared to M0. In the CG, a decrease in IgM concentration was detected at M24 compared to M0 (p < 0.05). Approximately 57% (4/7) of the neonates in the PG presented leukograms without alterations at M24. In the CG, leukograms without alterations were observed only at M72 in 55.5% (5/9) of the animals. The mortality rate was 22% (2/9) in the CG. There was no mortality in the PG. This was the first study using fresh frozen plasma as an adjuvant in the treatment of neonatal sepsis in dogs and evaluation of biomarkers in diagnosis. It was concluded that sepsis led to changes in the physiological parameters of neonatal dogs, demonstrating that the evaluation of leukocytes, troponin I and lactate can be used in the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis. It was concluded that, besides being an important source of IgM, fresh frozen plasma stimulated healing of puppies with neonatal sepsis, by prompt (within 24 h) improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters. Plasma therapy has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of sepsis and is a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing neonatal mortality."
41575701,"Lung function impairment and risk of sepsis and sepsis-related mortality: a large cohort study with over 310,000 participants.",2026,"Hypoxia is associated with systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which contribute to sepsis development, yet whether impaired lung function is associated with a higher sepsis risk remains unclear. Leveraging data from 312,805 UK Biobank participants, we assessed baseline lung function as percentages of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), and defined normal lung function as FEV(1)⩾80% predicted and an FEV(1)/FVC ratio ⩾ 0.70. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of sepsis incidence and sepsis-related mortality in relation to different measures of lung function. Stratified, sensitivity, and mediation analyses were conducted to assess potential effect modifications, result robustness, and mediation effect, respectively. During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 8,906 incident cases of sepsis and 1,664 cases of 28-day mortality following sepsis occurred. In the multivariable-adjusted model, compared with the highest quartile, the lowest quartile of FVC% predicted or FEV(1)% predicted was associated with an increased risk of sepsis and sepsis-related mortality (FVC% predicted: sepsis incidence, HR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.27-1.43, 28-day mortality following sepsis, HR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.29-1.72; FEV(1)% predicted: sepsis incidence, HR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.34-1.52, 28-day mortality following sepsis, HR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.51-2.02; all P(trend)<0.001). Similarly, compared with individuals with normal lung function, those with impaired lung function had a higher risk of sepsis and sepsis-related mortality (sepsis incidence: HR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.27-1.39; 28-day mortality following sepsis: HR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.42-1.73; both P-values<0.001). These associations remained consistent across stratified and sensitivity analyses. Mediation analyses revealed that inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), accounted for 1.2%-16.3% of the associations. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that lung function impairment is associated with an increased risk of sepsis and sepsis-related mortality, and these associations are partially mediated through inflammatory responses."
41575427,Recommendations of the GT-LATINFURG for the identification and initial management of patients with severe infection and sepsis in emergency departments.,2026,"In November 2021, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published an update to its 2016 guidelines and recommendations. Subsequently, during the CIMU 2022 (33rd World Congress on Emergency Medicine, held in March 2022 in Guadalajara, Mexico), the 2021 SSC Guidelines were reviewed and analyzed from the perspective of emergency physicians (EPs). The experts involved in this task also reached consensus and published several key points of greatest interest and concern to EPs regarding the management of patients with severe infection or sepsis in hospital emergency departments (EDs). These points included several improvement proposals developed by GTLATINFURG (Latin American Working Group for Improving Infection Care in Emergency Departments) and formally presented in what became known as the ""Guadalajara Declaration."" That document outlined complementary or alternative considerations to the 2021 SSC Guidelines. The first proposal was to ""develop guidelines aimed at detecting, preventing progression, and managing patients with severe infection and sepsis in EDs."" Since then-and owing to numerous original research studies and review articles published by the GT-LATINFURG and INFURG-SEMES groups (Infection Study Group of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine)-we can now claim that there is scientific evidence generated in EDs themselves, or at least that existing evidence has been reviewed while considering the specific role of EPs. The main aim of this consensus document, as the initial presentation of the first proposal of the Guadalajara Declaration, is to analyze-based on routine clinical practice, experience, available evidence, and the perspective of ED physicians-several key issues and controversies in order to establish recommendations through expert consensus grounded in current scientific evidence."
41573561,"m-EASIX (better than EASIX) predicts severe CAR T-cell toxicities, worse overall survival, and discriminates cytokine release syndrome from sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are life-threatening complications that often arise after CAR T-cell immunotherapy. Endothelial dysfunction is believed to play a central role in their development, leading to the interest in biomarker-based tools for diagnosis and differentiating these toxicities from sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate the Endothelial Activation Stress Index (EASIX) and its modified version (m-EASIX, which replaces creatinine with C-reactive protein [CRP] (mg/dL)) as early predictors of severe CRS and ICANS, as well as tools to distinguish CRS from sepsis. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy for CD19-positive hematologic malignancies (n=94) or multiple myeloma (n=23) were included. EASIX and m-EASIX scores were measured at various time points: before CAR T-cell infusion, 24-48 hours post-infusion, at CRS or ICANS onset, and after treatment for each toxicity. A comparator group of 129 sepsis patients, including 86 with hematologic malignancies, was also analyzed. RESULTS: Both EASIX and m-EASIX correlated with biomarkers of endotheliopathy, with m-EASIX showing stronger predictive power for severe toxicities and ICU admission. Higher EASIX and m-EASIX values at early time points were associated with worse overall survival (OS). Furthermore, m-EASIX accurately distinguished CRS from sepsis at symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: m-EASIX is a practical and accessible tool for the early prediction of severe CAR T-cell-related toxicities, risk stratification, and differential diagnosis from sepsis, offering potential to guide clinical decision-making and early intervention."
41572767,IL-33 Alleviates Sepsis-Induced Liver Injury by Regulating the NF-kappaB/BCL-2 Pathway.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a tissue-derived alarmin released during sterile and infectious stress, modulates inflammatory responses in an organ-specific manner. Although IL-33 is implicated in hepatic pathophysiology, its functional mechanism in sepsis-induced liver injury (SILI) remains insufficiently characterized. METHOD: SILI was modeled in vivo via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and in vitro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary hepatocytes. The multimodal evaluations included oxidative stress analysis, inflammatory cytokine measurements, liver functional biomarker analysis, and histomorphological studies. IL-33 signaling was investigated by combining transcriptomic pathway analysis with pharmacological interventions with soluble ST2 decoy receptor (sST2) and ST2-neutralizing (anti-ST2) antibodies. The SILI model dynamically increased the IL-33 level. RESULTS: Exogenous IL-33 conserved liver architecture, improved function, and reduced both inflammation and oxidative damage. Critically, blocking IL-33/ST2 signaling with an anti-ST2 antibody or sST2 eliminated the protective effect of IL-33, worsening hepatocellular damage. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IL-33/ST2 stimulation reduced NF-kappaB pathway activity, improved BCL-2 expression, and inhibited caspase-3-- mediated apoptosis. The lack of the antiapoptotic effects of IL-33 on NF-kappaB pathway activation validated its regulatory axis specificity. DISCUSSION: This study identifies IL-33/ST2-NF-kappaB-BCL-2 as a key axis mitigating hepatocyte apoptosis in SILI. IL-33-based therapies may offer dual control of inflammation and cell death, though clinical translation requires temporal optimization. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the pharmacologically targeted IL-33/ST2-NF-kappaB-BCL-2 pathway decreases sepsis-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. These findings indicate that IL-33-based treatments may be feasible for treating SILI and that this axis coordinates cytoprotection by concurrently controlling inflammatory signals and apoptotic processes."
41572258,"Persistent immune, coagulation and cardiac dysregulation are correlated with later post-discharge mortality in children with severe malnutrition.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Children with complicated severe malnutrition (CSM) face high mortality after hospital discharge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While early post-discharge mortality (< 2 months) has been linked to a sepsis-like inflammatory profile measured at discharge, it is unclear whether this relationship persists (later mortality; 2-6 months post-discharge). This study investigated whether immune, inflammatory, and endothelial dysfunction at 2 months post-discharge are associated with later mortality in children recovering from CSM. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within a randomised placebo-controlled trial of daily co-trimoxazole in HIV-negative children aged 2-59 months with CSM in four Kenyan hospitals. Cases were children who died between 2 and 6 months post-discharge; controls were survivors frequency-matched by sex, site, and trial arm. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, endothelial markers, and untargeted proteomics were measured at discharge and 2 months post-discharge. Conditional Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, site, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and randomisation arm, was used to identify biomarkers associated with later mortality. RESULTS: Cases were younger (had a median of 7 vs. 11 months), had longer hospital stays (14 vs. 10 days), and showed lower anthropometry (MUAC = 10.7 vs. 12.0 cm) and lower haemoglobin (9.7 vs. 10.6 g/dL) at 2 months post-discharge (all p < 0.05). Mortality 2-6 months post-discharge was associated with elevated inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-10 [hazard ratio, HR: 1.47, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.00-2.14], IL-15 [1.65, 95% CI: 1.08-2.51], IFN-alpha2 [1.51, 95% CI: 1.02-2.23]), acute phase proteins, apolipoproteins and coagulation markers, including fibrinogen, histidine-rich glycoprotein (1.40, 95% CI: 1.01-1.94), protein C inhibitor (SERPINA5, 1.50, 95% CI: 1.07-2.08), SERPINA10 (1.42, 95% CI: 1.02-1.99), and ADAMTS13 (0.41, 95% CI: 0.24-0.70). Additionally, cardiovascular and muscle-related proteins such as angiotensinogen (1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.08), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.98), PI16 (0.72, 95% CI:0.54-0.97), and zyxin (0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.92) were elevated in cases. CONCLUSIONS: Later mortality in children recovering from CSM is associated with persistent immune activation, a sepsis-like phenotype involving multiple systems. These findings suggest that children at risk of later mortality may benefit from biomarker-guided interventions initiated at discharge."
41571726,"A machine learning-based prediction model for poor prognosis in sepsis using lymphocyte count: a national, multicenter prospective cohort.",2026,"Sepsis-induced immunosuppression leads to poor prognosis. Circulating lymphocyte count (LC), as an easily accessible clinical marker, closely reflects the immune status of sepsis. The study aims to perform immune phenotyping of sepsis patients using dynamic LC for early identification of high-risk individuals. A latent class trajectory model (LCTM) was used to analyze the dynamic trajectories of lymphocyte count (LC) based on repeated measurements obtained within at least two measurements of lymphocyte count (LC) within the first 24 h after sepsis diagnosis, followed by two more between day 2 and day 7. Survival differences among subphenotypes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Feature selection was conducted via the Boruta algorithm, and a high-precision machine learning model was developed to predict the target trajectory. Model interpretability was ensured through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The predictive performance of the model for ICU mortality was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The derivation cohort included 2085 sepsis patients from the China Multicenter Sepsis database, and the external validation cohort of 1299 sepsis patients. We identified four trajectory patterns of LC dynamics, among which the persistent lymphopenia (PL) subgroup exhibited the highest disease severity and poorest prognosis. The trajectory model demonstrated consistent patterns in external validation. Six machine learning models were utilized to determine the best model to identify the PL subphenotype, and an online prediction tool was developed for clinical application. Incorporating the PL trajectory subphenotype significantly improved the predictive performance for ICU mortality. Dynamic LC trajectories effectively capture immunological heterogeneity in sepsis, encompassing immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. These findings underscore the importance of early identification of patients with persistent lymphopenia to better target populations for future sepsis immunotherapy."
41571634,Longitudinal plasma proteomic signatures of elite and viremic spontaneous HIV controllers.,2026,"A small percentage of people living with HIV (PLHIV) spontaneously regulate viral replication without suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART) and are categorized into 'elite controllers' (EC, HIV-RNA < 50 c/mL) and 'viremic controllers' (VC, HIV-RNA between 50-10,000 c/ml). Some EC and VC may lose controller status in time. Here we provide extensive plasma proteomics to identify biomarkers and pathways related to spontaneous viral control and its long-term preservation among 36 EC and 147 VC (discovery) and 14 EC and 5 VC (validation). VC exhibited higher concentrations of CRTAM, LY9, and CD6 and lower concentrations of VAT1 compared to EC in both the discovery and validation cohort. Longitudinal analysis of pre- and post-ART samples (median follow-up: 5.3 years) revealed downregulation of various immune-related proteins in both EC and VC. Over a 17-year follow-up period, loss of viral control occurred in 31% of VC and 3% of EC. T-cell associated proteins (CRTAM, LY9, CD6), along with ICAM3, SH2D1A, C1QL2, and CNGB3, predicted loss of viral control years before its occurrence. Markers of chronic immune activation (sPD-L1, sCD25, IL-10, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) and systemic inflammation (TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6, and sCD14) were not predictive. Our findings underscore the dynamic interplay between T cell function and viral replication in maintaining HIV control and identify key biomarkers that predict viral load surges."
41570698,Integrative analysis identifies lactylation-related biomarkers in sepsis via bioinformatics and machine learning.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Protein lactylation is a novel post-translational modification driven by lactate and has emerged as a critical link between cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis. However, a systematic profiling of lactylation-related genes (LRGs) and their diagnostic potential in sepsis remains unexplored. METHODS: We conducted an integrative study leveraging transcriptomic data from public repositories (GSE236713 as training set; GSE28750 as validation set). Differential expression analysis identified sepsis-associated genes, which were intersected with LRGs from GeneCards to obtain candidate genes. Functional enrichment was performed. Three machine learning algorithms-LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)-were employed to screen for core biomarkers. Their diagnostic efficacy was validated using ROC curve analysis. Immune infiltration profiles were assessed via CIBERSORT. Key findings were further corroborated in a murine sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We identified 10 candidate LRGs from the initial 3252 differentially expressed genes. Machine learning algorithms narrowed this down to three core biomarkers: SLC4A4, SLC16A4, and CRYAB. These biomarkers demonstrated consistent differential expression patterns (down-regulation of SLC4A4 and up-regulation of SLC16A4 and CRYAB) in both the training and independent validation cohorts. ROC analysis confirmed their robust diagnostic performance, with AUCs all exceeding 0.7. Furthermore, these biomarkers showed significant correlations with specific immune cell subsets, particularly CD8(+) T cells and activated mast cells, suggesting a role in immune dysregulation. Validation in the CLP mouse model confirmed the significant dysregulation of these three genes in septic lung tissue. CONCLUSION: This multi-disciplinary study identifies SLC4A4, SLC16A4, and CRYAB as promising lactylation-related diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis. Our findings indicate the intricate interplay between lactate metabolism, epigenetic modification, and immune dysfunction in sepsis, providing new insights for early diagnosis and mechanistic investigation."
41570454,Screening of kinase-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers and immune infiltration analysis in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory syndrome that can lead to loss of organ function. Kinase-related genes (KRGs) modulate immune diseases by regulating inflammation, immune metabolism, and apoptosis. However, their specific role in Sepsis remains unexplored. METHODS: mRNA and single-cell sequencing data in sepsis were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify gene modules associated with sepsis, which were intersected with KRGs to determine candidate genes. Functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, GSVA) were conducted, followed by biomarker selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Model performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and immune infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT and ssGSEA. Consensus clustering defined kinase-associated molecular subtypes of sepsis, while CellChat analysis of single-cell data characterized intercellular communication patterns. RESULTS: This study employed WGCNA and machine learning analyses to identify four key diagnostic genes for sepsis-ZAP70, TXK, TRRAP, and TRIM28-and constructed a highly accurate diagnostic model (AUC = 0.986). Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant associations with T cells, NK cells, and other cell types. Single-cell data analysis demonstrated increased proportions of platelets and neutrophils in sepsis, highlighted the prominent role of monocytes in intercellular communication, and showed widespread expression of TRIM28 in monocyte subsets. Additionally, two distinct molecular subtypes with significant immune differences were identified. CONCLUSION: This study systematically analyzed KRGs in sepsis and identified four clinically valuable biomarkers. By integrating single-cell transcriptomic data, it offers novel insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and proposes potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
41568992,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and DNase Activity in Sepsis: Associations with Coagulopathy and Organ Dysfunction.,2026,"BackgroundNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular reticular structures released from activated neutrophils. This study investigated the relationships among NET constituents-cell-free DNA (cfDNA), histone H3, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein-as well as deoxyribonuclease (DNase), and the severity of organ dysfunction and coagulopathy in patients with sepsis.MethodsIn this exploratory retrospective study, we analyzed serum samples that were collected prospectively and clinical data of 58 adult patients with sepsis admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Hokkaido University Hospital between September 2019 and October 2021. Participants were divided into high and low cfDNA groups based on the median cfDNA level upon arrival. NET components and DNase activity were measured using fluorescence assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).ResultsThe high cfDNA group demonstrated significantly elevated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scores, greater leukocytosis, and more pronounced coagulopathy compared to the low cfDNA group. Serum cfDNA, histone H3, and HMGB1 levels were positively correlated and increased with DIC severity. However, serum DNase activity did not differ significantly between groups, nor did it correlate with NET components, DIC scores, or organ dysfunction severity.ConclusionsIn patients with severe sepsis, elevated levels of NET components were associated with poor clinical outcomes, reflecting enhanced NET formation. However, DNase activity did not influence NET levels or clinical severity. These findings suggest that NET components may serve as useful biomarkers of sepsis severity, while DNase activity appears unrelated to clinical outcomes in this context."
41568578,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is associated with improved survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with venetoclax and azacitidine.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency impairs cellular redox balance through reduced NADPH production and is the most common enzymatic disorder-causing anemia. Venetoclax combined with azacitidine (Ven-Aza) targets leukemic stem cells by disrupting oxidative phosphorylation and inducing mitochondrial stress. This study hypothesized that G6PD deficiency may enhance the efficacy of Ven-Aza in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by reducing leukemic cell metabolic resilience. METHODS: The authors studied 73 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed (ND) AML treated with Ven-Aza. G6PD activity was systematically assessed at diagnosis in all patients and categorized as normal (n = 47), borderline (n = 11), or deficient (n = 15). RESULTS: Composite complete remission rates were 93% in the G6PD deficient group versus 69% in the normal/borderline group (p = .03). Patients with G6PD deficiency had a significantly longer median overall survival (23.8 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9-38.7), as compared to 8.96 months (95% CI, 2.9-15.0) in the normal/borderline group (p = .034). In multivariate analysis, G6PD-deficiency was associated with improved survival as compared to patients with normal G6PD activity (hazard ratio, 0.417; 95% CI, 0.181-0.965, p = .043). No significant differences were observed across groups in rates of febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis, or grade 3-4 cytopenia. CONCLUSION: G6PD deficiency is associated with higher response rates and improved survival in patients with ND-AML treated with Ven-Aza. These findings support G6PD deficiency as a potential biomarker of therapeutic sensitivity to Ven-AZA and may uncover metabolic vulnerabilities in AML with potential therapeutic implications."
41567647,Preventive effect of small molecule active substances on septic cardiomyopathy after abdominal trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the preventive effects and mechanisms of active small molecules against septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) induced by abdominal trauma or abdominal-origin sepsis in animal models. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched in January 2000- May 2025 for studies assessing active small molecules in animal SCM models. The standardised mean difference ([SMD], Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to molecular categories, sepsis induction methods, and outcome measures. Methodological quality was assessed using the Systematic Review of Laboratory Animal Experiments risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled meta-analysis showed that active small molecules had an overall beneficial but heterogeneous effect on SCM (SMD = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.52-3.47, I(2) = 92.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed large but imprecise effects for polyphenols (SMD = 4.81, 95% CI: -5.25-14.87) and neutral effects for flavonoids (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -3.64-2.73). The efficacy was greater in lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis models (SMD = 2.86) compared with cecal ligation and puncture models (SMD = 0.16). Outcomes involving cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase and creatine kinase isozymes) showed consistently positive and robust effects, while functional outcomes (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction) exhibited inconsistent results. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness, while funnel plots indicated possible publication bias (Egger's test, p = 0.123). Methodological limitations, including incomplete reporting of randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment, were commonly observed. CONCLUSION: Active small molecules demonstrate generally positive yet heterogeneous preventive efficacy against SCM in animal models, with polyphenolic compounds in particular showing notable potential. Variability across molecular categories, sepsis models and measured outcomes highlights the need for standardised methodologies in future studies."
41567194,Lysophosphatidic acid: a promising biomarker for diagnosing sepsis and predicting in-hospital mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has anti-inflammatory and protective effects in sepsis, yet clinical evidence on its correlation with sepsis progression and outcomes is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the association of plasma LPA levels with sepsis development, severity, and mortality. METHODS: A total of 42 sepsis patients and 29 controls with common infections were included. Among the sepsis patients, 15 succumbed during hospitalization. Plasma LPA levels were measured, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma LPA was significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to controls, and further reduced in non-survivors. Notably, correlation analyses suggested that LPA levels were negatively correlated with neutrophil count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Multivariate regression analysis identified LPA as an independent risk factor for sepsis onset and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that LPA had a high diagnostic accuracy for sepsis (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reduced plasma LPA levels in sepsis patients are inversely correlated with infection/inflammation markers and SOFA scores. Together, these results suggest that LPA may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for sepsis, supporting its potential as a complementary tool to enhance early risk stratification and guide bedside clinical decision-making."
41565843,Association between the lactate to creatinine ratio and hospital mortality in patients with pediatric sepsis: a cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between lactate to creatinine ratio (LCR) and prognosis in pediatric sepsis is poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the association between LCR and hospital mortality in pediatric sepsis patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 4379 patients with pediatric sepsis, categorized by LCR quartiles, was performed. The association between LCR and hospital mortality was investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, as well as subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Restricted cubic splines were employed to explore non-linear relationships, and a two-piece logistic proportional hazards model was constructed for both sides of the inflection point. RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality rate for pediatric sepsis was 9.6%. Following adjustment for relevant covariates, a positive correlation between LCR and hospital mortality was observed. A nonlinear relationship between the baseline LCR and the risk of hospital mortality was identified, with LCR < 0.780 associated with a significantly higher risk. Beyond the LCR turning point of 0.780, the risk did not substantially increase. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a nonlinear relationship between the LCR and hospital mortality in children with sepsis. When the LCR is less than 0.780, hospital mortality rises drastically as the LCR advances. IMPACT: This research delves into the non-linear correlation between the lactate to creatinine ratio (LCR) and hospital mortality in pediatric sepsis patients. It identifies a critical threshold of LCR < 0.780 linked to higher mortality rates. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of LCR's significance in pediatric sepsis, suggesting it as a potential biomarker for risk assessment and clinical decision-making. The implications of these findings could potentially lead to improved treatment strategies, ultimately decreasing hospital mortality in children with sepsis by optimizing lactate and creatinine management."
41563955,Effect of fluoxetine on organ dysfunction and mortality in severe sepsis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units, characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Recent evidence suggests fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, may exert immunometabolic effects beneficial in sepsis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of fluoxetine on vasopressor duration, organ dysfunction, inflammatory markers, and mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Ain Shams University Hospitals (December 2024-June 2025), 46 patients with severe sepsis were randomized 1:1 to receive either fluoxetine (40 mg/day) or placebo in addition to standard sepsis care. The primary outcome was vasopressor duration. Secondary outcomes included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-1, procalcitonin), lactate levels, ICU length of stay, and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Fluoxetine significantly reduced vasopressor duration (6.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.8 days; p < 0.001), ICU stay (15.9 +/- 1.6 vs. 17.1 +/- 1.1 days; p = 0.005), and inflammatory markers by day 7, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, CRP, and procalcitonin (all p < 0.05). SOFA and APACHE II scores were also lower in the fluoxetine group on days 7 and 10. No significant difference in 28-day mortality was observed (8.7% vs. 17.4%; p = 0.381). CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine as adjunctive therapy in severe sepsis may reduce vasopressor dependence, attenuate inflammation, and shorten ICU stay without increasing adverse effects. Its mortality benefit remains uncertain and warrants further investigation."
41563442,Longitudinal biomarker trajectories and their prognostic utility for 21-day mortality in burn patients with sepsis: a retrospective cohort study.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the longitudinal trajectories of multi-category biomarkers and evaluate their association with 21-day all-cause mortality in critically ill burn patients with sepsis. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, we analyzed 943 adult burn patients with sepsis, defined per Sepsis-3.0 criteria. Serial measurements of 15 biomarkers across nutritional, immunoglobulin, lymphocyte subset, inflammatory, and other categories were collected over 21 days. We employed linear mixed-effects models (LME) to compare trajectories between survivors and non-survivors, Cox regression to assess associations with mortality, time-dependent ROC to evaluate predictive performance, and k-means clustering to identify patient phenotypes based on integrated ALB, IL-6, and IgG trajectories. RESULTS: The 21-day mortality was 17.92%. LME revealed significantly different trajectories for 11 biomarkers between survivors and non-survivors (P < 0.05). Univariate Cox analysis identified multiple significant biomarkers, with transferrin (HR = 0.985, P = 6.84 x 10(-)(11)) and IgM (HR = 0.284, P = 1.24 x 10(-)(5)) as strong protective factors, and mitochondrial DNA (HR = 1.002, P = 1.89 x 10(-)(9)) as a risk factor. In multivariate analysis, only the Burn Index remained an independent risk factor (HR = 1.066, P < 0.001). Time-dependent ROC showed peak predictive accuracy at Day 7 (albumin AUC = 0.729). Clustering identified three distinct phenotypes-""Rapid Recovery"" (mortality 5.2%), ""Persistent Inflammatory & Catabolic"" (mortality 38.0%), and ""Intermediate"" (mortality 18.7%; P < 0.001)-with starkly different biomarker trends and clinical profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic patterns of multi-category biomarkers are strongly associated with short-term survival in burn sepsis. While burn severity is a dominant baseline risk factor, longitudinal trajectory analysis captures the essence of the host's recovery or failure, effectively stratifying patients into prognostically distinct subgroups. This trajectory-based phenotyping highlights the potential of monitoring the host response over time to improve risk assessment and guide personalized management."
41563115,"Shock: Pathophysiology, Classification, and the Role of Lactate in Diagnosis and Prognosis.",2026,"Shock is a life-threatening state of circulatory failure characterized by inadequate tissue oxygen delivery and cellular hypoxia. Lactate has emerged as a central biomarker in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of shock, yet its interpretation is complex and context dependent. Although traditionally viewed as a marker of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoperfusion, hyperlactatemia in distributive shock, particularly sepsis, frequently reflects multifactorial mechanisms, including increased aerobic glycolysis, adrenergic stimulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired hepatic clearance. This review examines the pathophysiology and classification of shock, the biochemical basis of lactate production and clearance, and the prognostic significance of both static lactate levels and lactate kinetics. We synthesize evidence supporting lactate as a robust prognostic marker while highlighting limitations of lactate-targeted resuscitation strategies. Emerging data favor multimodal approaches integrating lactate trends with complementary perfusion markers such as capillary refill time and central venous oxygen saturation. Lactate should be interpreted as one component of a comprehensive physiological assessment rather than an isolated therapeutic target."
41561118,The multifaceted role of kallistatin in human diseases: mechanistic insights and translational potential.,2025,"Kallistatin, a multifunctional serine protease inhibitor, is widely distributed with tissue-specific effects. It may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human diseases. Through binding to its two structural elements and specific receptors, it regulates differential signaling cascades, and thus has a wide spectrum of biological functions. In cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure, it exerts protective effects by improving endothelial function, anti-inflammation, and regulating lipid metabolism. In liver diseases, high hepatic expression correlates with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, while decreased serum levels indicate severe cirrhosis or liver fibrosis. In metabolic diseases, it regulates insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammation. In inflammatory diseases, its role is dual: it attenuates inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, etc., but exacerbates chronic rhinosinusitis and autoimmune uveitis by promoting inflammatory cytokines secretion. In cancer, it inhibits tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, with lower tumor tissue expression linked to cancer development. Kallistatin also serves as a potential biomarker for chronic kidney disease, preterm birth, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on kallistatin's mechanisms in organ injury and repair, emphasizes its therapeutic potential across disease contexts, and discusses challenges and future directions for clinical translation, including organ-targeted strategies and combination therapies."
41561091,"Clinical and molecular features of candidemia: a three-year retrospective study in Northern Guizhou, China.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: Candidemia, a life-threatening infection with rising incidence and substantial mortality, necessitates improved management strategies. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features, species distribution, risk factors, antifungal susceptibility, and molecular epidemiology of Candida albicans isolates from candidemia patients over a three-year period. METHODS: This retrospective study included 133 patients with candidemia from a teaching hospital in Guizhou, China between December 2019 and November 2022. Clinical data were compared between C. albicans (n = 63) and non-C. albicans (NAC) (n = 70) groups. Risk factors and prognostic biomarkers were identified using logistic regression and ROC analysis. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for C. albicans isolates. RESULTS: NAC species predominated (52.6%) over C. albicans (47.4%). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 48.1%, higher in C. albicans infections. For C. albicans, hypoalbuminemia and septic shock were independent mortality risk factors, while antifungal therapy and higher platelets were protective. For NAC, septic shock and elevated serum urea were risk factors. Prognostic biomarkers included D-dimer and CRP for C. albicans, and serum urea and total bilirubin for NAC. Most isolates were antifungal-susceptible, though C. glabrata and C. tropicalis showed increased azole non-susceptibility. MLST of 48 C. albicans isolates identified 7 novel alleles and 23 new DST types. CC9 was the predominant clonal complex. CC138 and CC139 are newly reported clonal complexes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that candidemia remains a serious threat with high mortality. The distinct risk factors and prognostic biomarkers between C. albicans and non-C. albicans species indicate the need for species-specific management. Although overall resistance remains low, emerging azole non-susceptibility in key species underscores the necessity for continuous susceptibility surveillance. MLST revealed a highly diverse and evolving C. albicans population, including novel genetic lineages. Integrating molecular epidemiology with clinical data is crucial for advancing global candidemia management."
41560311,Cell-Free DNA-Based Theranostics for Inflammatory Disorders.,2026,"Inflammatory disorders are characterized by immune-mediated inflammatory cascades that can affect multiple organs. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is not only a biomarker for various inflammatory diseases, but also a driver in innate immune responses, offering emerging diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for inflammatory diseases. This review begins by examining immune signatures in inflammation, with particular focus on the vicious cycle between cfDNA and inflammatory responses. We then discuss cfDNA detection strategies and their clinical applications as disease biomarkers. Crucially, we highlight design principles and formulation strategies for cfDNA-based interventions for inflammation regulation, considering physical, biochemical, and immunological properties of cfDNA. These approaches encompass advanced nanotechnologies such as drug loading, targeted delivery, inflammation-responsive release, and microenvironment reprogramming. Subsequently, we examine cfDNA intervention strategies for precision treatment of inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, periodontitis, and psoriasis. Finally, we present key insights and future perspectives, as well as discuss translational challenges and clinical considerations, thereby paving the way for innovative approaches to inflammation modulation and disease management."
41558793,Cystatin C for predicting acute kidney injury in critically ill children with bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe complication in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), particularly among children with bacterial sepsis. Although the epidemiology of sepsis-associated AKI is well described, reliable biomarkers to predict both its onset and associated mortality are still lacking, limiting their integration into routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the incidence, clinical phenotype and modifiable risk factors of bacterial sepsis-related AKI in a single-centre PICU cohort and to evaluate the utility of novel biomarkers in refining early risk-stratification. METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, data from 475 children admitted to the PICU with severe bacterial infections were analysed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and logistic regression analyses were employed to identify biomarkers associated with the occurrence and prognosis of AKI. A nomogram model was developed to facilitate clinical application. The predictive utility of these biomarkers was further validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Among the 475 children with bacterial infections, 50 (10.53%) developed AKI. Of these, 20 children died, resulting in a mortality rate of 40%. Regression analysis, model construction and validation through ROC and DCA revealed that elevated cystatin C levels were significantly associated with both AKI occurrence and AKI-related mortality in children with bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that elevated cystatin C is a robust predictor of both AKI onset and AKI-related mortality in critically ill children with severe bacterial infections. The nomogram incorporating cystatin C enables early identification of high-risk patients and may support clinical decision-making to improve outcomes."
41558249,Fuzzy classification of sepsis subtypes and implications for trajectory and treatment.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is common and deadly, and subtypes are proposed to guide precision treatment. However, little is known about the uncertainty in subtype classification, and its implications for trajectory and treatment response. METHODS: In multiple electronic health record and trial data of adults with sepsis, we assigned patients clinical sepsis subtypes (alpha, beta, gamma, or delta-type), and measured uncertainty by defining core (>/=90%) and margin (<90%) strata for each subtype according to model-derived membership probabilities. In multivariable logistic regression models, we determined the association between subtype, core/margin strata, and two outcomes, i.) change in subtype over 48 h and ii.) 365-day mortality in the ProCESS randomised trial. FINDINGS: We included 35,691 adult patients (mean age 68 [SD 16] years; 51% male, 85% White, 5.7% in-hospital mortality) with community-acquired sepsis according to Sepsis-3. Most patients changed clinical sepsis subtype during the 48 h after presentation (82%) regardless of initial subtype. The majority of patients were in the margin stratum of the subtype (alpha-type: 70%, beta-type: 66%, gamma-type: 64%), except for those in delta-type (18% margin strata). The odds of subtype change over 48 h was increased in the margin strata (interaction p = 0.023), where, for example, patients with the margin delta subtype had significantly higher odds than patients with alpha core (ref) subtype (odds ratio, 7.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.16-9.85). For risk-adjusted 365-day mortality in the ProCESS trial, the effect of randomised treatment was modified by the subtype margin strata (interaction p = 0.026). INTERPRETATION: In patients with community sepsis, clinical subtypes are dynamic. Patients on the subtype margin are more likely to change groups, and uncertainty of subtype classification modified treatment effects.

41556075,Metabolomic profiling of patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a condition characterized by acute brain dysfunction developed in the absence of a primary infection in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to perform a pilot, untargeted metabolomic profiling of the blood plasma of SAE patients to identify metabolic changes potentially associated with the pathological condition and to generate hypotheses for further studies of its pathogenesis, as well as to the search for promising biomarkers, and the assessment of the severity of the patient's condition. Metabolomic profiling was performed using HPLC-HR-MS, followed by statistical analysis of the obtained data. This blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial revealed significant differences in the metabolic profiles of the study and control groups. Functional analysis showed the metabolic pathways most affected by pathological processes in SAE patients. These included metabolism of acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and taurine, folate biosynthesis, and the drug metabolism involving the cytochrome P450 pathway. In SAE patients with impaired consciousness, including delirium and coma, decreased levels of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines were observed. The metabolomic profiles of SAE patients differed significantly between the groups of deceased and surviving patients: concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids were significantly lower in the group of deceased than in the group of survivors. Our study identified 64 candidate biomarkers that could potentially be used to predict sepsis outcomes. However, further study is needed using an expanded and independent cohort of patients."
41556021,Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case Series.,2025,"Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a rare and poorly understood manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, encompassing a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In order to highlight the diagnostic complexity and therapeutic challenges of NPSLE, this report presents the management of three distinct presentations. We retrospectively reviewed cases of three female patients with NPSLE admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment strategies, and outcomes were analyzed. Each case demonstrated unique NPSLE manifestations: acute confusional state in the setting of sepsis, cerebral vasculitis with retinal involvement, and catatonia. Treatments included high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil, with varying degrees of clinical improvement. NPSLE remains a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity and lack of definitive biomarkers. Early recognition and individualized immunosuppressive treatment are essential for improved outcomes."
41555631,Nucleated Red Blood Cells for Predicting Mortality in Intensive Care Unit Patients With Sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND The search for biomarkers to predict the clinical course and mortality of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains ongoing. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count and percentage in predicting clinical outcomes and mortality in patients with sepsis monitored in the ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 160 patients with sepsis who were followed in the ICU between March 2023 and March 2024 and stayed for more than 48 hours. Laboratory values and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS Eighty-one patients (50.625%) died. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were higher, and the Glasgow Coma Scale scores were lower, in the mortality group (P<0.001 for all). NRBC counts at ICU admission, at discharge, and 48 hours before discharge were significantly higher in patients who died (P=0.029, P=0.004, and P=0.02, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed the highest area under the curve (AUC) for NRBC at discharge (AUC=0.631) with a cut-off of 10 NRBC/microL. NRBC at admission had an AUC of 0.6, with a cut-off value of 20 NRBC/microL and specificity of 0.848. CONCLUSIONS NRBC values, when combined with established scoring systems, may aid in guiding sepsis management. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the process and determine cut-off values."
41555449,The association between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with atrial fibrillation.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio (BAR) is an emerging biomarker that has been associated with sepsis, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, few studies focus on its association with the prognosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Participants were categorized into three groups based on the BAR tertiles. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to demonstrate the survival rates among three groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were conducted to explore the correlation between BAR and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 1523 AF patients were enrolled in this study, with a median age of 73.8 years, of whom 933 (61.3%) were male. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with elevated BAR represented an increased incidence of 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that patients with the highest BAR were independently related to an elevated risk of 28-day (HR, 2.14 [95% CI 1.54 ~ 2.96]; P < 0.001) and 365-day (HR, 2.20 [95% CI 1.72 ~ 2.83]; P < 0.001) all-cause mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. Nonlinear relationships were observed between BAR and 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality based on the RCS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: BAR may serve as an indicator for risk stratification in critically ill AF patients."
41555414,Artificial intelligence for early diagnosis in emergency department.,2026,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly prominent player in emergency medicine, offering innovative tools to enhance the early diagnosis of acute conditions. This systematic review explores how AI, particularly through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is transforming the way physicians and healthcare professionals respond to high-stakes clinical scenarios. The evidence gathered shows that smart algorithms are capable of detecting complex patterns in clinical, diagnostic, and laboratory data, patterns that may even elude expert clinicians, especially under the high-pressure environment of the emergency room. From acute coronary syndrome to stroke, from sepsis to respiratory failure, AI has demonstrated impressive predictive power and provides real, practical support in risk stratification, triage optimization, and faster diagnosis. Equally important is its role in automated medical image analysis, which enables quicker and more accurate diagnostic decisions, offering real-time support for clinicians. However, the widespread adoption of these technologies also brings significant challenges: the need for algorithmic transparency, the necessity of earning the trust of healthcare providers, and the sensitive ethical issues related to patient data privacy. To overcome these barriers, it is essential to involve healthcare professionals in the development and implementation of AI technologies-ensuring their clinical expertise complements the analytical power of these new tools. Targeted training programs and large-scale validation studies are critical steps for ensuring the safe and effective use of AI. Ultimately, this review confirms that AI holds great promise as a catalyst for a more efficient, timely, and patient-centered approach to emergency medicine."
41555186,Integrated Analysis of the Immune Infiltration Pattern and Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers in Septic Cardiomyopathy.,2026,"PURPOSE: In this study, various informatics analyses were employed to identify the hub genes associated with septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) onset and investigate their immune infiltration status. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing data of myocardial tissue samples from mice with SCM were obtained from the GEO database and our previously published articles. The Limma and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) packages were used to identify the hub genes associated with SCM onset. GSEA and the DAVID database were employed for gene enrichment analysis. Additionally, the CIBERSORT database was used to analyze the immune infiltration in SCM. Finally, the multiMiR package was used to analyze the microRNAs acting as ceRNAs for the hub genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Mendelian randomization analysis were used to evaluate the predictive value of hub genes for SCM. RESULTS: The SCM group included nine samples, while the control group included ten samples. SCM upregulated 15 genes and downregulated 7. Mt1 and Actc1 were the most significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. GO analysis indicated that the most significantly enriched biological process was ""response to bacterium,"" and the most enriched signaling pathway was ""mineral absorption."" Immunoinfiltration analysis revealed decreased T cells CD4 naive, B cells naive, resting mast cells, and M2 macrophage infiltration in the hearts of SCM mice. WGCNA and Limma package analyses identified Clu, Igf1, and Trp53 as hub genes associated with SCM onset. The ROC curves demonstrated a strong correlation and predictive value for Trp53, Igf1, and Clu in the SCM. Moreover, Clu and Igf1 demonstrated predictive values for SCM using Mendelian randomization analysis from the IEU database. Eleven miRNAs formed a ceRNA network with these hub genes. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results implicated Igf1 and Clu as the potential candidates involved in SCM pathogenesis."
41554280,Machine Learning-Based Clusters of Vital Signs and Lactate Levels Predict Vasopressor Use in Sepsis.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a major clinical challenge because of its complex, heterogeneous, and multidimensional clustering patterns. This study aimed to investigate the association between vasopressor administration and machine learning-derived clusters based on initial vital signs and lactate measurements obtained in emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using data from the Korean Shock Society Septic Shock (KOSS) Registry (septic shock in the ED) and the Marketplace for Medical Information in Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (ICU patients with suspected infection). To derive clusters, k-means clustering was applied to six initial vital signs and serum lactate measurements. The primary outcome was vasopressor administration. Secondary outcomes included second vasopressor administration and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 17,500 patients were included in the analysis (KOSS cohort, n=7,130; MIMIC-IV cohort, n=10,370). K-means clustering identified three distinct clusters in each cohort. In the KOSS cohort, Cluster 3 was characterized by the lowest mean arterial pressure (MAP) (62 mmHg [IQR, 53-71]) and the highest diastolic shock index (DSI) (2.6 [2.3-3.0]). This cluster was associated with the highest rates of vasopressor administration (93.9%), second vasopressor administration (33.5%), and 28-day mortality (25.3%) (all p<0.001). Comparable physiological and clinical patterns were observed in the MIMIC-IV cohort, in which Cluster 3 likewise demonstrated the lowest MAP (68 mmHg [60-76]) and highest DSI (2.0 [1.8-2.3]). This group similarly exhibited the poorest outcomes, including vasopressor administration (41.0%), second vasopressor administration (16.7%), and 28-day mortality (29.0%). CONCLUSION: Machine learning-derived clusters based on initial vital signs and serum lactate levels demonstrated different patterns of vasopressor use and mortality. The clinical utility of this approach for guiding timely or targeted vasopressor therapy requires prospective validation."
41551844,Prediction of hospital mortality in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury using a machine-learning approach: a multicenter study using SHAP interpretability analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) represents a critical complication with high mortality rates in intensive care units. Current risk stratification tools lack precision and interpretability for clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate interpretable machine learning models for predicting hospital mortality in S-AKI patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized five international critical care databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV (n = 12 966), MIMIC-III-CareVue (n = 2209), eICU (n = 8210), Northwestern University Intensive Care Unit (NWICU) (n = 2207) and Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb) (n = 1893). Adult patients with S-AKI meeting sepsis-3.0 and acute kidney injury criteria were included. Feature selection used the Boruta algorithm on MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-III and eICU databases. Eleven machine learning algorithms were trained using MIMIC-IV data with external validation on all other datasets. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided model interpretability. RESULTS: Among 27 485 S-AKI patients, hospital mortality was 27.5%. Boruta identified 21 consensus features including severity scores [Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OASIS], vital signs and laboratory parameters. Gradient Boosting Machine emerged as optimal with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.770 (training), 0.731 (internal validation) and 0.732-0.778 across four external validation cohorts. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and minimal overfitting (3.9% AUC difference). Decision curve analysis revealed superior clinical utility across probability thresholds of 4%-82%. SHAP analysis identified SAPS II as the most important predictor, with scores >60 and SOFA >15 associated with substantially increased mortality risk. Complete case analysis confirmed model robustness (AUC 0.766-0.847). CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning model demonstrated excellent performance and robust generalizability for S-AKI mortality prediction across five international databases. SHAP analysis provided clinically meaningful insights supporting personalized risk stratification and evidence-based clinical decision-making."
41551638,Development and deployment of an interpretable stacking ensemble model for predicting in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with chronic kidney disease and sepsis.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an interpretable stacking ensemble model for predicting in-hospital mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CKD and sepsis and to deploy it as a web-based tool for bedside clinical use. METHODS: Data were extracted from the MIMIC-IV 3.0 database and split into training and test sets at a 7:3 ratio. Feature selection was performed by combining the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with the Boruta algorithm. Eight machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized via ten-fold cross-validation and grid search. The two models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) in the training set were combined using a stacking ensemble strategy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to improve interpretability. Model performance was compared with the SOFA score. RESULTS: A total of 5344 ICU patients with CKD and sepsis were included, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 19.1%. After feature selection, 16 variables were retained. In the training set, XGBoost and LightGBM performed best. The stacking model achieved an AUC of 0.757 on the test set, outperforming SOFA (AUC = 0.668). SHAP analysis identified age, Acute Physiology Score III, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, and respiratory rate as the top predictors. The model was also deployed as a publicly accessible web application. CONCLUSION: The stacking ensemble model demonstrated good discriminatory performance and interpretability for predicting in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with CKD and sepsis. Its web-based deployment provides a convenient platform for early risk assessment, although external validation is needed to confirm its broader applicability."
41550731,Widely targeted metabolomics and machine learning identify succinate as a key metabolite in sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment. We used widely targeted LC-MS/MS plasma metabolomics in 29 healthy controls, 32 sepsis patients, and 27 SAE patients, combined with machine learning, to define metabolic patterns across these groups. This approach identified 12 discriminatory metabolites, with succinate showing a stepwise increase from health to sepsis to SAE and associations with clinical severity scores. To test its functional relevance, we used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model and found that exogenous succinate supplementation aggravated cognitive deficits, neuronal injury, and microglial activation. Together, these findings link systemic metabolic remodeling to brain inflammation and dysfunction in sepsis and suggest that succinate and related pathways may help stratify SAE risk and provide mechanistic entry points for future therapeutic exploration."
41550605,Platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio stratifies surgical risk and mortality in necrotizing enterocolitis neonates with portal venous gas.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Portal venous gas (PVG) represents a severe complication of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), typically signaling disease progression and a poor prognosis. While PVG has traditionally been regarded as an indication for surgical intervention in NEC, accumulating clinical evidence indicates that not all cases require operative management. Currently, surgical decision-making for NEC neonates with PVG primarily relies on subjective clinical assessments by physicians, resulting in substantial management uncertainty. The platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio (PCR), an objective and convenient biomarker integrating information on disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated predictive value in neonatal sepsis and other conditions. However, the utility of the PCR has not yet been explored in NEC-PVG patients. This study retrospectively evaluates the predictive value of the PCR for surgical intervention and prognosis in this high-risk population, aiming to facilitate early identification and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed 186 neonates diagnosed with NEC (Bell stage >/= IIa) and ultrasonographically confirmed PVG (2021-2024). We evaluated the PCR, calculated at the time of PVG diagnosis, for predicting surgical intervention and 30-day mortality by employing multivariate logistic regression (which included collinearity assessment and bootstrap validation) to identify independent factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess predictive performance and determine optimal cutoff values, supplemented by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort demonstrated a surgical intervention rate of 37.10% (69/186) and a 30-day mortality of 13.98% (26/186). Multivariate analysis identified the PCR as an independent predictor for both surgical intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.86) and mortality (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.92). ROC curve analysis established PCR thresholds of </=4.84 x 10(9)/mg for surgical intervention (AUC 0.84; sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%) and </=2.57 x 10(9)/mg for mortality prediction (AUC 0.80; sensitivity 69%, specificity 91%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the PCR is a promising predictor of surgical intervention and mortality risk in NEC-PVG patients, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to individual parameters. Based on these findings, we propose the incorporation of PCR testing into standard clinical monitoring protocols, using 4.84 x 10(9)/mg as a potential cutoff value to inform therapeutic decision-making. This approach may improve the clinical management and outcomes in this high-risk population."
41548530,A novel hypothetical protein (SAUSA300_1684) confers excellent protection against multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the murine model.,2026,"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of nosocomial infections, including sepsis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, and endocarditis, and continues to pose a major public health challenge due to escalating multidrug resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine. To address this unmet clinical need, we employed a machine learning-guided reverse vaccinology approach to systematically interrogate the S. aureus proteome for novel vaccine antigens. This strategy led to the identification of eight previously uncharacterized hypothetical proteins with predicted immunogenic properties. Among these, SAUSA300_1684 protein (designated IMTS8) was prioritized for detailed translational evaluation. IMTS8 was found to be highly conserved across major clinical S. aureus lineages and expressed throughout growth phases of the methicillin-resistant strain USA300-FPR3757. Analysis of the surface-shaved proteome revealed that IMTS8 is likely exposed on the bacterial surface, a finding further substantiated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunization of mice with recombinant adjuvanted IMTS8 elicited strong antigen-specific IgG responses and conferred near-complete protection in a murine staphylococcal infection model. Collectively, these findings identify IMTS8 as a promising protein subunit vaccine candidate for the prevention of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. In addition, this study highlights the translational utility of machine learning-based reverse vaccinology as an effective platform for accelerating antigen discovery against antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens."
41545523,Plasma glutamic acid predicts myelosuppression and mortality in septic patients using machine learning.,2026,"Myelosuppression is a common secondary manifestation of sepsis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence suggests that amino acid metabolism, particularly that of glutamic acid, may influence hematopoietic function and inflammatory responses(1). Using a machine learning technique, we aimed to evaluate whether plasma amino acid levels at hospital admission are associated with myelosuppression and 30-day mortality in septic patients, with a focus on glutamic acid as a potential early biomarker. We conducted a prospective observational study on 390 adult patients hospitalized with sepsis at the University Hospital of Trieste. Patients were stratified into two groups on the basis of peripheral blood counts: myelosuppressed and non-myelosuppressed. Plasma levels of 13 amino acids were quantified at admission via high-performance liquid chromatography. Inflammatory markers, clinical outcomes, and 30-day mortality were recorded. Predictive models for myelosuppression were developed via Random Forest and interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. While nutritional intake and longitudinal amino acid trends were not available, we accounted for major comorbidities in the analysis. Myelosuppression was identified in 152 patients (39%) and was associated with significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin), an increased incidence of bacteremia, and increased 30-day mortality (20% vs. 12%, p = 0.03). Patients experiencing myelosuppression had lower median glutamic acid concentrations (134 vs. 154 micromol/L, p = 0.05). Among the 44 clinical and metabolic features, glutamic acid was the strongest predictor according to SHAP analysis. Furthermore, glutamic acid concentrations less than 134 micromol/L were associated with reduced survival according to Kaplan Meier analysis (p = 0.013). Reduced plasma glutamic acid levels at admission are independently associated with myelosuppression and worse prognosis in septic patients. Although causality cannot be established and nutritional/temporal factors were not captured, glutamic acid may represent an early biomarker for risk stratification and deserves further investigation in longitudinal and interventional studies."
41544064,Assessment of Annexin A3 as a Potential Biomarker for Sepsis in Critically Ill Patients: A Meta-analysis and Retrospective Cohort Study.,2026,"BackgroundCurrent research indicated the comprehensive investigation of Annexin A3 (ANXA3) in sepsis patients remain uncertain. The aim of this research is to investigate the potential of ANXA3 as a biomarker for prediction of sepsis.MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis utilizing public datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Array Express database to summarize and evaluate the expression of ANXA3 in sepsis patients. Then, we conducted a retrospective study to explore the role of plasma ANXA3 in 153 critically ill patients. Furthermore, the predictive ability of ANXA3, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for the occurrence of sepsis were evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC).ResultsTotally, the meta-analysis including 3241 sepsis and 1088 controls indicated sepsis patients were with markedly higher levels of ANXA3 mRNA expression (SMD = 2.01(1.54-2.48); P < 0.001). Meanwhile, sepsis deaths (n = 552) were with limited higher expression of ANXA3 mRNA than sepsis survivors (n = 2004) (SMD = 0.14(0.04-0.24); P < 0.01). Furthermore, our results indicated increased plasma ANXA3 on admission were significantly associated with the incidence of sepsis in critically ill patients (OR = 2.41(1.75-3.32), P < 0.001). As a predictive biomarker, plasma ANXA3 resulted in a better AUC 0.815(0.745-0.886) than PCT (0.673(0.584-0.761)) and IL-6 (0.672(0.585-0.759)) and SOFA score (0.668(0.577-0.759)). Additionally, patients with higher plasma ANXA3 had a poorer overall 28-day survival in critically ill patients (HR = 2.16(1.09-4.28); P < 0.05), but not for sepsis patients (HR = 1.63(0.65-4.06); P > 0.05).ConclusionsOur study indicated increased ANXA3 obtained a good predictive ability for sepsis. Meanwhile, plasma ANXA3 was associated with mortality of critically ill patients, but not sepsis patients. The use of ANXA3 as a biomarker in sepsis patients require further evaluation in larger studies."
41543097,Th17/Treg Imbalance in Acute Kidney Injury.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Helper T cell 17 (Th17) and regulatory T cells (Treg) play an important role in the inflammatory response. However, the role of Th17/Treg imbalance in acute kidney injury is not yet established. The aim of the study was to analyze Th17/Treg imbalance in acute kidney injury caused by sepsis or other reasons. METHODS: An observational prospective study was conducted. We enrolled adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute kidney injury caused by sepsis or other reasons and then followed up until 28 days or discharge. Healthy volunteers were followed during the same period as the control group. We investigated the differences in renal injury markers and inflammatory indicators between acute kidney injury (AKI) patients and the control group. The clinical data and peripheral blood samples of all patients were collected immediately after enrollment. An analysis of the data was conducted to determine if the Th17/Treg ratio could serve as a predictive marker of sepsis induced acute kidney injury (SAKI) in AKI patients. RESULT: A total of 104 AKI patients were enrolled in the study, including 60 SAKI, 44 AKI without sepsis, while 10 healthy volunteers served as the control group. Infections, especially thoracoabdominal infection leading to sepsis, were the major cause of AKI in the study population (58%). Th17/Treg ratio, the proportion of Th17 cells, the concentration of interleukin-10 (IL-10), and the concentration of interleukin-17 (IL-17) of AKI patients showed a significant increase compared to that in the control group. The proportion of Th17 cells and Treg cells as well as the Th17/Treg ratio of the SAKI group were higher than those of the AKI without sepsis group. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Th17/Treg ratio were independent risk factors for SAKI. The AUC demonstrated that the Th17/Treg ratio measured 0.775 (95% CI 0.683 - 0.851, p < 0.0001). The cutoff value of Th17/Treg ratio for predicting SAKI was 0.033. When the Th17/Treg ratio was > 0.033, the sensitivity of predicting SAKI was 0.967, and the specificity was 0.500. The 28-day mortality and renal function recovery rate between the SAKI group and the AKI without sepsis group did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: There was an imbalance of Th17/Treg in acute kidney injury. Compared with AKI caused by other factors, Th17/Treg ratio was higher in SAKI patients. There was no difference in 28-day mortality and renal function recovery rate among AKI patients with different etiologies."
41542853,A comprehensive understanding of HDL-associated apolipoproteins: future potential biomarker in sepsis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by dysregulated host immune and metabolic responses to infection, is associated with high mortality, making accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment crucial. Sepsis often induces a notable reduction in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. As the fundamental structural and functional components of HDL, apolipoproteins play pivotal roles in mediating the function of HDL. Therefore, these apolipoproteins can serve as potential biomarkers in sepsis. AREAS COVERED: This review systematically synthesizes current evidence on the dynamic expression profiles of these apolipoproteins in sepsis, highlighting the relation of their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with sepsis and clinical relevance in diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, it also summarizes the underlying mechanisms by which these apolipoproteins are involved in the progression of sepsis. EXPERT OPINION: The changes in the levels of HDL-associated apolipoproteins can characterize the progression of sepsis and the type of infecting bacteria, and provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of sepsis. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of their integrated effects holds promise for developing precision interventions to improve clinical outcomes of sepsis."
41542631,Heterogeneous causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome correlate with distinct peripheral polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites.,2026,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a heterogeneous syndrome of hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to dysregulated pulmonary inflammation, is caused by diverse insults. Because of this heterogeneity, mechanisms and treatments are difficult to study. As a treatment, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has had mixed results. PUFAs and downstream oxylipins are important to pulmonary inflammation but are not well defined in ARDS. We hypothesized that differences in fatty acid metabolism, as measured by levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and oxylipins, are associated with differences in ARDS outcomes, ARDS causes, and inflammation. To test this, PUFAs/oxylipins were measured by LC MS/MS in plasma samples from 90 patients with ARDS. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) were measured by ELISA. Multivariate linear regressions modeled the relationship between PUFAs/oxylipins, inflammation, and ARDS mortality, severity and cause. Multiple n-3 and n-6 PUFA derived oxylipins were decreased in severe ARDS. We did not detect differences in PUFAs/oxylipins by mortality. PUFAs/oxylipins varied by cause of ARDS, especially between patients with sepsis and those with trauma. Furthermore, specific oxylipins were associated with IL-6 and IL-8. Based on our identification of oxylipins that vary by disease severity and injury, these metabolites should be considered as potential biomarkers and mechanisms of lung repair biomarkers. Furthermore, differences in PUFAs did not directly correlate with changes in oxylipins, suggesting differences in lipid metabolism by etiology of injury. Further consideration of differences in lipid metabolism in ARDS could identify potential subgroups that could benefit from n-3 PUFA supplementation or other therapies."
41542228,Molecular Landscape and Predictive Significance of Programmed Cell Death-Related Genes in Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, remains a significant health challenge with high morbidity and mortality rates. The molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis, particularly the role of programmed cell death (PCD), are not fully understood. This study is aimed at elucidating the transcriptomic changes associated with sepsis, emphasizing PCD, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers. Transcriptome data from sepsis and control samples were extracted from the GEO website. Differential expression analysis identified genes perturbed in sepsis. WGCNA revealed 14 highly connected modules, with the turquoise module showing the strongest association with sepsis. A set of 262 hub genes was identified, which were mainly associated with apoptotic signaling pathways. Seven prognostic-related overlapping feature genes (PRGs) were identified. More importantly, the diagnostic model, constructed using eight machine learning algorithms, exhibited high efficacy in distinguishing sepsis patients from controls. The validation of feature genes at the scRNA-seq level adds a layer of robustness to our conclusions. The strong association of genes like S100A9 and KLHL3 with neutrophils, pivotal players in sepsis, suggests potential avenues for therapeutic targeting. Our comprehensive analysis has unveiled the significant role of PCD in sepsis. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for future therapeutic interventions."
41541820,Validation of the ICD-10 Diagnoses of Early-Onset Neonatal Infection in the Danish National Patient Register from 2010 to 2018.,2026,"PURPOSE: To examine the accuracy of the diagnoses of early-onset neonatal infection in the Danish National Patient Register. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All Danish neonates born after 35 weeks of gestation with an ICD10 diagnosis of sepsis or meningitis within the first week of life between 2010 and 2018 were identified. To examine the validity of the diagnoses, medical records were reviewed for 500 neonates diagnosed with sepsis and all 63 neonates diagnosed with meningitis. Proven infection was defined by bacterial pathogens identified from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Probable sepsis was defined as at least 5 days of antibiotic treatment, two clinical signs of infection, and one abnormal blood biomarker. Probable meningitis was defined as at least 14 days of antibiotics, neurological affection, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis consistent with meningitis. Positive predictive values (PPVs) with 95% CI were estimated using the proven definition of infection as well as the criteria for either proven or probable infection. RESULTS: The PPV for sepsis diagnoses using the proven definition was 0.04 (0.02, 0.06), while the PPV using both the proven and probable definition was 0.52 (0.45, 0.58). Sepsis diagnoses with a specified pathogen showed the highest PPV for proven sepsis at 0.36 (0.29, 0.43) and for proven or probable sepsis at 0.65 (0.58, 0.72). The PPV for meningitis diagnoses using the proven definition was 0.24 (0.13, 0.37), while the PPV using both the proven and probable definition was 0.38 (0.25, 0.52). CONCLUSION: We found a poor validity for the ICD10 diagnoses of early-onset neonatal infection in the Danish National Patient Register. This highlights that the diagnoses should be used cautiously in future research and surveillance and emphasises the need for supporting information on microbiological samples. Additionally, this highlights the importance of establishing a consensus definition of neonatal sepsis to improve diagnostic accuracy."
41539372,Exosomes from young healthy human plasma ameliorate sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by inhibiting ferroptosis via the miR-3130-3p/LPCAT3 axis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is one of the leading causes of mortality in sepsis patients, and currently, there are no effective treatments available. Ferroptosis has been proven to play a critical role in SICM. Exosomes from the young healthy human plasma (exosomes(Young)) were shown to improve cardiac fibrosis post-myocardial infarction in our previous studies. However, their role in SICM remains unclear. METHODS: We established in vivo and in vitro models of SICM induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The severity of cardiac and cardiomyocyte injury was evaluated through echocardiography, histological analysis, measurements of myocardial injury markers, and cell viability assays. Improvements in SICM via inhibition of ferroptosis by exosomes(Young) were demonstrated by assessing ferroptosis-related indicators, including Fe(2+), malondialdehyde (MDA), Liperfluo (LPO) levels, PTGS2 expression, and mitochondrial structural integrity. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that exosomes(Young) significantly improved cardiac function and mitigated morphological damage in the hearts of mice with SICM. Exosomes(Young) also enhanced the viability of LPS-induced cardiomyocytes, reduced levels of lipid peroxides and ferroptosis biomarkers, and suppressed ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, and mitochondrial ultrastructural damage. Mechanistically, high-throughput sequencing analysis followed by qRT-PCR validation identified miR-3130-3p as a key effector molecule. Upregulation of miR-3130-3p mimicked the therapeutic effects of exosomes(Young) on LPS-induced cardiac injury and mediated the cardioprotective role of exosomes(Young) against ferroptosis in SICM. Further, target gene prediction using databases and validation with a dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed LPCAT3 as the direct target gene of miR-3130-3p in inhibiting ferroptosis. Overexpression of LPCAT3 could reverse the protective effects of miR-3130-3p on LPS-induced SICM. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these findings reveal for the first time that exosomes(Young) improve SICM by inhibiting ferroptosis via miR-3130-3p targeting LPCAT3. This study provides novel insights into the potential of exosomes(Young) as promising cardioprotective candidates for patients with SICM."
41539047,The utility of interleukin-6 compared to conventional sepsis biomarkers in pregnancy - A real-world cohort study.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of interleukin-6 (IL-6) versus in-use inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT], neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [NLR]) in maternal sepsis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in a single Dublin maternity hospital. All maternity patients (conception to 6-weeks post-partum) in whom IL-6 was measured to investigate suspected sepsis in an 11-month period were included. Cases were categorized twice into physiological (normal, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, septic shock) and etiological (bacterial, viral or no infection) categories. Biomarker performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and measures of diagnostic accuracy at optimal cut-offs. Serial sampling evaluated biomarker kinetics. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were included, 31.9 % had sepsis/septic shock, and 70.9 % had bacterial infection. Significant differences between categories were seen for both physiological and etiological axes for IL-6, for physiological categories alone for NLR, and for neither for PCT and CRP. IL-6 had an AUC of 0.78 for the primary physiological endpoint, significantly higher than CRP and PCT (p = 0.02), but not NLR (AUC 0.72, p = 0.47). The IL-6 AUC for the primary etiological endpoint was 0.94, higher than all other biomarkers (p < 0.001). IL-6 was highly sensitive (91.4 %) but poorly specific (55.1 %) for the physiological endpoint, while both were high in the diagnosis of bacterial infection (88.2 % and 90.5 %). On serial sampling, IL-6 fell rapidly between first and second sampling, while others initially rose further. CONCLUSION: IL-6 exhibited significantly higher sensitivity compared to conventional sepsis biomarkers in detecting both bacterial infection and maternal sepsis."
41535672,Comparative evaluation of multimodal point-of-care tests to differentiate gram-negative from gram-positive infections in critically ill adults: a diagnostic accuracy study.,2026,"PURPOSE: Patients with suspected sepsis often receive broad-spectrum antibiotics before culture results are available. A rapid point-of-care test (POCT) that indicates Gram-negative (GN) versus Gram-positive (GP) infection could help tailor empiric therapy. We systematically compared available POCT for GN/GP differentiation and, for biomarkers, examined clinically usable thresholds. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (January 2005 to August 2025) were searched for studies in adults with sepsis that evaluated rapid tests to distinguish GN from GP infection. We pooled host-response biomarkers, pathogen-directed assays, omics-based tests, and clinical-parameter approaches using a bivariate random-effects model to obtain pooled sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) and Youden's index. For biomarkers reported at multiple cut-offs, clinically relevant strata were prespecified and compared. RESULTS: Of 86 included studies, 72 were eligible for quantitative synthesis. Pathogen-directed rapid assays (PCR, MALDI-TOF MS) showed the highest and most consistent accuracy (pooled sensitivity and specificity > 0.90; AUC 0.97-0.99; Youden 0.85-0.92). Among the biomarker studies, procalcitonin (PCT) showed clear threshold dependence: the 3-5 ng/mL stratum provided the most balanced discrimination (sensitivity 0.84; specificity 0.83; AUC 0.90; Youden 0.67), whereas higher cut-offs did not yield further gains. Omics-based approaches showed variable accuracy, and clinical-parameter approaches alone achieved sensitivity and specificity < 0.70. CONCLUSION: In adults with sepsis, pathogen-directed rapid assays are the most reliable POCT for early GN/GP differentiation. When biomarker testing is available, a PCT range of 3-5 ng/mL is a pragmatic working threshold that can support earlier tailoring of empiric antimicrobial therapy."
41535484,Optimizing sepsis mortality prediction using hybrid federated learning and explainable AI framework.,2026,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, frequently leading to organ failure and high mortality in hospital settings. Early identification of sepsis is critical for reducing mortality; however, conventional diagnostic approaches often fail to capture complex clinical patterns at an early stage. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) have demonstrated potential for improving predictive accuracy while supporting clinical interpretability. Nevertheless, concerns related to data privacy and model transparency continue to limit real-world clinical adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid framework that integrates federated learning with ensemble-based machine learning models and explainable AI techniques for sepsis mortality prediction. The framework employs Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression models, trained in a decentralized manner to preserve patient data privacy. Model interpretability is enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), enabling transparent and clinician-oriented decision support. The proposed framework is evaluated using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), in both centralized and federated settings. Experimental results demonstrate that ensemble models, particularly Random Forest and gradient boosting methods, achieve high predictive performance while maintaining robustness in a federated environment. The findings indicate that combining FL with XAI enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and interpretable sepsis mortality prediction, supporting reliable clinical decision-making and potential deployment in real-time intensive care unit applications."
41534299,Elevated plasma Ang2/Tie2 ratio as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for sepsis in leukemia patients.,2026,"Dysregulation of the Ang-Tie pathway drives vascular leakage in sepsis. This study investigates plasma Ang-Tie axis components as sepsis biomarkers in leukemia through a retrospective cohort of 77 patients (36 with sepsis, 41 without sepsis). Septic patients exhibited significantly lower Ang1 (log(10): 2.685 vs 3.143 pg/mL) and Tie2 (log(10): 2.300 vs 2.800 pg/mL), but higher Ang2 (3.258 vs 2.841 pg/mL) than controls (P < 0.01). Critically, elevated Ang2/Ang1 (1.185 vs 0.917) and Ang2/Tie2 ratios (1.381 vs 0.995) strongly correlated with sepsis susceptibility. The Ang2/Tie2 ratio demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.860, sensitivity = 86.1%, specificity = 80.5%) compared to routine biomarkers (D-dimer, procalcitonin). Strikingly, an Ang2/Tie2 ratio > 1.121 (Youden index) predicted a 3.5-fold increased mortality risk (95% CI: 1.51-8.25), independent of the leukemia subtype or treatment phase. These findings position the Ang2/Tie2 ratio as a dual diagnostic and pro gnostic biomarker for sepsis in leukemia patients, offering a mechanistic link between endothelial injury and poor outcomes. Our work bridges vascular biology and hematologic oncology, providing actionable insights for early intervention and targeted therapies to mitigate vascular leakage in high-risk populations."
41530284,Nomogram-based analysis of plasma albumin and C-reactive protein 30 days before bloodstream infection for 30-day mortality in Singapore and Denmark.,2026,"This study aimed to assess the prognostic impact of plasma albumin (PA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), measured up to 30 days before a bloodstream infection (BSI), on 30-day mortality risk using nomogram models. Two cohorts comprising 5,221 inpatients from Singapore (SG) and 15,710 from Denmark (DK) with first-time BSIs were included from 2006 to 2016. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we analyzed the association between CRP and PA measured at different time-points (segmented into 5-day intervals, up to 30 days before the day of BSI (D0), and on D0) and 30-day mortality. Moreover, nomogram models assessed the relative attributions of PA and CRP to 30-day mortality risk. Both cohorts had similar 30-day mortality rates (SG: 17.4%, DK: 20.2%). Correlation coefficients between PA on D0 and PA in all 5-day intervals were high (range: 0.55/0.75) whereas it was only high between CRP on D0, and CRP measured 1-5 days before D0. In nomogram models, PA contributed most to the prognostic predictability (from 20 to 55%) whereas CRP contributed little (from 0.5 to 9%) regardless of time interval from D0. Albumin, measured up to 30 days before a BSI episode, was a strong prognosticator of 30-day mortality. Nomogram models enable rapid evaluation of a patient's prognosis."
41529569,"Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), a double-edge sword that affects prognoses in critically ill patients: A prospective study.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal inflammatory responses and viral infections play a critical role in the pathogenesis of critical illnesses. Critically ill patients frequently develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a key determinant of clinical outcomes and a marker of poor prognosis. Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), an important inflammatory regulatory cytokine, may serve as a more accurate indicator of viral infection severity and holds potential as a predictor of MODS and prognosis in critically ill patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between IFNgamma levels and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: This prospective study, conducted from January 1 to May 31, 2023, at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, used data from electronic medical records to collect baseline characteristics, ICU parameters, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes. MODS was diagnosed on the basis of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. Generalized Additive Models were employed to explore linear and nonlinear associations, while survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were analyzed. IFNgamma levels demonstrated a significant positive linear correlation with MODS in both sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 1.041, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.962-1.126) and non-sepsis (OR 1.025, 95% CI: 0.907-1.157) subgroups (intergroup P < 0.001). The relationship between IFNgamma levels and 28-day mortality followed a U-shaped curve, with a threshold of 5.3 ng/mL. In the sepsis subgroup, patients with low IFNgamma levels exhibited poorer prognoses compared with those with high IFNgamma levels (P = 0.021). No significant difference in prognosis was observed between procalcitonin (PCT) subgroups (P = 0.087). Among patients with elevated IFNgamma levels, a positive correlation between PCT and 28-day mortality was identified (OR 1.098, 95% CI: 0.815-1.481). CONCLUSION: IFNgamma is strongly associated with MODS and prognosis in critically ill patients, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for predicting MODS occurrence and patient outcomes. These findings underscore the clinical value of IFNgamma in critical care, providing a foundation for further research in this area."
41528462,Assessment of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA as a damage associated molecular pattern in predicting severity and mortality of sepsis and septic shock patients.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening conditions with high mortality, presenting challenges in predicting disease severity and outcomes. Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has emerged as a potential mediator in sepsis pathogenesis, acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that exacerbates inflammation. The present study aimed to assess cell-free mtDNA levels as predictors of mortality and disease severity, and to determine their correlation with established clinical markers. METHODS: A prospective study enrolled 150 participants, including healthy controls (n = 50) and patients (n = 100, of which 50 had sepsis and 50 had septic shock). Plasma cell-free mtDNA levels were quantified using RT-qPCR, and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive ability of cell-free mtDNA for 28-day mortality. The cell-free mtDNA correlated with clinical markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), Procalcitonin (PCT), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate. RESULTS: Cell-free mtDNA levels were significantly elevated in sepsis and septic shock patients compared to controls, and higher in septic shock compared to sepsis patients. Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher cell-free mtDNA levels than survivors across both sepsis and septic shock subgroups. Cell-free mtDNA demonstrated a superior predictive value for 28-day mortality, area under the curve (AUC = 0.865) compared to clinical markers (CRP, SOFA, PCT, NLR, and Lactate). Furthermore, cell-free mtDNA levels showed a positive correlation with CRP, followed by SOFA, NLR, and PCT. CONCLUSION: Elevated circulating cell-free mtDNA levels were associated with severity and mortality in sepsis and septic shock, and may act as a valuable molecular tool for predicting disease outcomes. The study's findings warrant further investigation into the potential of cell-free mtDNA as a future component of clinical management strategies in sepsis."
41527570,Identification and analysis of exosome-associated signatures in pediatric sepsis by integrated bioinformatics analysis and machine learning.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis (PS) is a critical condition characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction and immune dysregulation, including exosome-mediated immune modulation, often linked to infections. Investigating the role of exosome-related genes (ERGs) in the pathogenesis of PS is essential for identifying significant diagnostic and therapeutic targets. METHODS: Four datasets, namely GSE66099 (training set) and GSE13904, GSE26378, and GSE26440 (validation sets), were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differential expression of 56 ERGs was analyzed, followed by consensus clustering to identify distinct exosome-related patterns in PS. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to identify PS-related genes (SRGs). Additionally, the immune microenvironment was assessed, and diagnostic models were developed employing specific machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: The differential expression analysis identified 21 ERGs that exhibited significant alterations in PS. Consensus clustering revealed two distinct subtypes of PS based on the expression pattern of ERGs. WGCNA identified several hub genes involved in exosome function and PS, with immune-related pathways, including phagocytosis and NF-kappaB signaling, showing significant enrichment. These genes were leveraged to construct machine learning models, which demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.995. The analysis identified CD177, GYG1, IRAK3, MCEMP1, and TLR5 as key biomarkers. Furthermore, external validation confirmed the superior performance of the constructed model. CONCLUSION: This study elucidated the role of ERGs in PS, and highlights the significance of immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of the disease. The developed diagnostic models represent promising tools for the early detection and prognosis prognostic of PS."
41527518,UMI-77 Ameliorates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Modulating the Brain-Gut Axis.,2026,"PURPOSE: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common neurological complication of sepsis. UMI-77 has shown unique benefits in modulating inflammation to improve sepsis. However, the exact role of UMI-77 in the treatment of SAE and its mechanism are unknown. AIM: This article analyzes UMI-77 based on metabolomics and explores its mechanism of action in treating SAE based on the brain-gut axis. METHOD: In this study, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of UMI-77 on SAE mice. Applying untargeted metabolomics analysis, the metabolic changes in the brain and intestines of septic mice treated with UMI-77 were examined. Furthermore, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select predictive biomarkers for exploring the mechanism of UMI-77 in treating SAE. FINDINGS: Sixty-six significant biomarkers in the brain were found and selected with the aid of untargeted the metabolomic method. Metabolic pathway analysis indicates that these differential metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of linoleic acid, biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and phenylalanine metabolism. Seventy-eight important biomarkers were identified and selected in the intestine; metabolic pathway analysis revealed that these differential metabolites were mainly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, and biotin metabolism. L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan are the most important metabolites. CONCLUSION: UMI-77 plays a positive regulatory role in disrupting the gut microbiota of mice through pathways such as the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and can significantly improve neurological function and reduce apoptosis of brain tissue cells."
41525335,Role of Sepsis Markers as Potential Biomarkers for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"GOALS: This study aimed to investigate whether sepsis markers act as biomarkers of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). BACKGROUND: The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is advantageous. This prospective observational study investigated whether the sepsis markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), presepsin (PSEP), procalcitonin (PCT), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), act as biomarkers of UC and CD. STUDY: Patients with UC or CD underwent endoscopy and assessment of the abovementioned sepsis markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leucine-rich alpha 2 glycoprotein (LRG). We prospectively examined the association of these markers with clinical activity and endoscopic scores, including the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with UC and 49 patients with CD were enrolled. MES significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in patients with UC. SES-CD significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, and PTX3 in patients with CD. In UC, MES to 3 groups showed significantly higher LRG, CRP, and IL-6 levels than the MES 0 to 1 groups. The LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 levels were significantly higher in the SES-CD >/=3 group than in the SES-CD </=2 group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 in UC and IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in CD are potential biomarkers. Overall, our findings could promote better management of IBD."
41522719,Prognostic Nutritional Index as a Novel Biomarker for Predicting Prognosis in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) has a high mortality rate with limited prognostic biomarkers. We investigated the relationship between the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and SAE outcomes. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study (2008-2019) enrolled 3202 SAE patients. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Multivariable-adjusted analyses (logistic regression, propensity score matching, and inverse probability weighting) assessed PNI's prognostic value, supplemented by generalized additive models (GAMs), Kaplan-Meier, and ROC analyses. External validation was performed. RESULTS: PNI independently predicted 28-day mortality (adjusted OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77-0.93). The GAM identified PNI = 34 as the optimal prognostic threshold. Patients with PNI < 34 had higher 28-day mortality than those with PNI >/= 34 in both original and validation cohorts (p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated strong discrimination in the original cohort (AUC = 0.879; sensitivity = 0.878; specificity = 0.880) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.724). Higher PNI correlated with better neurological function (Glasgow Coma Scale, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study establishes the PNI as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in patients with SAE. We identified that SAE patients with PNI < 34 exhibited significantly higher 28-day mortality rates and worse neurological function."
41522506,Platelet-lymphocyte ratio and its dynamic changes predict mortality in septic acute kidney injury patients: a retrospective multi-center study using U.S. database and Chinese hospital data.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a readily available marker that integrates systemic inflammatory burden and immune competence, has emerged as a cost-effective prognostic biomarker in critical care medicine. Elevated PLR has been linked to adverse outcomes across a spectrum of critical illnesses, yet its utility in predicting prognosis among patients with septic acute kidney injury (AKI) remains undefined. Moreover, little is known about how in-hospital trajectories of PLR influence survival outcomes. METHOD: This retrospective study employed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. The association between baseline PLR/changes in PLR (DeltaPLR) and 28-day and 90-day mortality was investigated by survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. DeltaPLR was calculated as PLR at discharge minus PLR at admission. Patients were stratified based on optimal PLR cut-off values determined from the training cohort, and results were validated internally and externally. Predefined subgroup analyses probed for effect modification across key clinical populations, and mediation analysis was conducted to quantify intermediate variables linking PLR/DeltaPLR dynamics to patient outcomes. RESULT: A total of 1,478 patients were included in the baseline-PLR cohort and 982 in the DeltaPLR cohort. In the training set, an elevated baseline PLR (>/=335.44) was associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality (26.56% vs. 18.66%, P = 0.009) and 90-day mortality (46.48% vs. 35.61%, P = 0.003). These findings were confirmed in both the internal validation cohort and an external cohort, and remained robust after adjustment for demographic, clinical and laboratory confounders. Conversely, lower DeltaPLR also predicted the 28-day (14.81% vs. 6.94%, P = 0.007; HR = 2.261, P = 0.005) and 90-day mortality (24.07% vs. 15.41%, P = 0.029; HR = 1.702, P = 0.017), as well as prolonged hospital stay (28.64 vs. 21.64 days, P = 0.004). The associations between PLR or DeltaPLR and mortality remained robust after adjusting for confounding factors. Subgroup analyses indicated that the prognostic value of PLR was particularly pronounced in non-urinary tract infection patients, and a low baseline PLR conferred a significant survival benefit in male patients. Mediation analysis revealed that changes in white blood cell count (DeltaWBC) mediated 27.99% of the association between DeltaPLR and 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Both baseline PLR and its dynamic change during hospitalization may serve as significant predictors of mortality in septic AKI. PLR-based indices could aid in risk stratification and early identification of high-risk patients."
41520524,Inflammatory imbalance in ambulance patients is associated with sepsis and septic shock.,2026,"The host immune response in sepsis involves both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, with monocytes playing a central role in the process. We have previously identified an in vitro response profile of endotoxin (LPS) tolerant primary human monocytes, consisting of eight cytokines/chemokines as well as a set of five transcription factors. In the current study, we evaluated differences in expression levels of these investigated molecular markers across different patient groups (patients with or without infection, and with or without sepsis), and their association with clinical outcomes (septic shock and in-hospital mortality), among 809 ambulance patients. The results showed that patients with sepsis displayed the lowest HLA-DRA expression levels together with the lowest TNF/IL-10 ratio, while most other cytokine/chemokines and gene expressions were elevated. Higher levels of HGF, CCL8, CCL2, TNF and IL-10, as well as upregulation of HIF1A and NFKBIA were seen in septic patients with septic shock. The data suggests that the investigated immunological markers linked to immunosuppressed monocyte responses are associated with patients with sepsis and septic shock."
41517778,Association of lactate to albumin ratio with the severity and prognosis of patients with sepsis admitted to the emergency intensive care unit: A prospective cohort study.,2026,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the lactate to albumin ratio (LAR) in predicting morbidity, acute kidney injury associated with sepsis (SA-AKI) and mortality in sepsis patients. This was a single-center prospective cohort study. All adult patients above the age of 18 with a diagnosis of sepsis who presented between January 1, 2024, and June 1, 2025, were included. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, septic shock and SA-AKI. The patients were divided into non-shock group and shock group, non-acute kidney injury group and acute kidney injury group, survival group and death group for comparison. Group differences were significant based on LAR quartiles. Univariate and Logistic regression analyses showed that LAR was an independent risk factor for septic shock, septic acute kidney injury, and 28-day mortality. Elevated LAR stratification was associated with a significantly increased risk of shock, acute kidney injury, and 28-day mortality. LAR remained an independent risk factor for shock, acute kidney injury, and death when used as a continuous variable. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of septic shock was 0.705 (95% CI = 0.611-0.800) when the cutoff value of LAR was 0.106. When the cutoff value was 0.097, the AUC of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury was 0.762 (95% CI = 0.669-0.854). When the cutoff value was 0.098, the AUC of 28-day mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.796-0.931). As the quartile of LAR layers increases, the risks of septic shock, SA-AKI and death gradually increased significantly. Early LAR has a certain predictive value for septic shock, SA-AKI and death outcomes."
41517447,Cetirizine and Dexamethasone in Sepsis: Insights into Maresin-1 Signaling and Cytokine Regulation.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality, yet its etiopathogenesis is still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cetirizine and dexamethasone (alone and in combination) on serum levels of Maresin-1 (MaR-1), TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in a rat model of sepsis induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8-10 weeks were used and randomly divided into 7 groups, each containing 7 rats: Group 1 (Control), Group 2 (Sham), Group 3 (Sepsis), Group 4 (Sepsis + Saline), Group 5 (Sepsis + Cetirizine), Group 6 (Sepsis + Dexamethasone), and Group 7 (Sepsis + Cetirizine + Dexamethasone). Sepsis was induced via CLP in all groups except Control and Sham. Results: In the sepsis groups (G3-G7), neutrophil and white blood cell counts increased while lymphocyte counts decreased (p < 0.05). In groups treated with cetirizine and/or dexamethasone (G5-G7), a significant decrease in neutrophils and an increase in lymphocytes were observed. MaR-1 levels significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in all sepsis-induced groups compared to controls, while interleukin levels significantly increased. Cetirizine and dexamethasone supplementation significantly increased MaR-1 levels and decreased interleukin levels (p < 0.05). The combined treatment was more effective. Conclusions: This study is the first to highlight the potential of MaR-1 as a critical biomarker in sepsis diagnosis and monitoring, and cetirizine and dexamethasone, especially in combination, may represent a promising therapeutic option in sepsis management."
41517263,"Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: IL-6 Dynamics, Inflammatory Phenotypes, and Short-Term Organ-Failure Trajectories in a Real-World Cohort.",2025,"Background and Objectives: In severe COVID-19-associated sepsis, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is used as a rescue strategy to modulate cytokine and coagulation derangements, but its biomarker and organ-failure effects remain incompletely characterised. We evaluated peri-procedural changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), other inflammatory markers, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores according to TPE intensity, timing, and inflammatory phenotypes. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study including 102 mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-associated sepsis who received >/=1 TPE session. Patients were grouped by number of sessions (1, 2, >/=3), timing (</=14 vs. >14 days from symptom onset), IL-6 responder status (>/=50% reduction), and two unsupervised inflammatory-thrombotic clusters. Peri-procedural changes (Delta) in biomarkers and SOFA were compared using non-parametric tests, with multivariable logistic and linear regression exploring predictors of IL-6 response and DeltaSOFA. Results: Baseline severity was similar across TPE-intensity groups, with median APACHE II scores of 11-12 and SOFA scores around 7 in all strata. Median IL-6 concentrations declined after TPE in each group (e.g., Delta -59.4 pg/mL after 1 session and Delta -65.1 pg/mL after >/=3 sessions), but between-group differences in DeltaIL-6 were not statistically significant (p = 0.276). By contrast, D-dimer exhibited a marked decline only in the 1-session group (median Delta -1.7 mg/L vs. ~0.0 mg/L in the 2- and >/=3-session groups; p < 0.001). Timing (early vs. late TPE) did not materially affect DeltaIL-6, DeltaCRP, DeltaSOFA (median 0.0 in both), or DeltaD-dimer. Overall, 50% of patients were IL-6 responders; baseline IL-6 was the only independent predictor (adjusted OR 1.9 per doubling, 95% CI 1.3-2.8). A hyperinflammatory-thrombotic cluster (n = 44) exhibited higher baseline IL-6 (612.3 vs. 92.4 pg/mL), more >/=3-session TPE (65.9% vs. 29.3%), and higher IL-6 responder rates (75.0% vs. 31.0%), but similar 28-day mortality (40.9% vs. 29.3%). Conclusions: In this real-world TPE programme, biochemical improvements-particularly IL-6 and D-dimer reductions in hyperinflammatory-thrombotic patients-were not consistently accompanied by short-term SOFA or survival benefits, underscoring the need for phenotype-guided and trial-based use."
41515668,Sequential Versus Non-Sequential Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Real-World Cohort Analysis of Survival in an Asian ICU.,2026,"Background: Severe sepsis and septic shock remain major causes of ICU mortality despite advances in critical care. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) is widely used in Asia for refractory endotoxemia, yet the optimal session strategy remains unclear. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed adult ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock treated with PMX-HP between 2013 and 2019 in a tertiary center in Taiwan. Patients were divided into sequential (>/=2 sessions within 24 h) and non-sequential groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital mortality, length of stay, organ support, and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) changes. Results: Among 64 patients, 33 (51.6%) received sequential therapy. The 28-day mortality was 46.9%, with no difference between groups after adjustment for baseline severity. Patients receiving sequential PMX-HP had longer hospital stays and more frequent CRRT use, likely reflecting greater underlying disease severity rather than a causal effect of treatment sequencing. Conclusions: Multivariate analysis identified higher APACHE II score, positive VIS change, and CRRT requirement as independent predictors of mortality. Sequential therapy itself was not associated with improved outcomes. Prognosis in PMX-HP-treated patients is determined mainly by underlying severity and hemodynamic instability, underscoring the need for patient selection and biomarker-guided strategies rather than routine sequential use."
41515611,Predictive Factors of Early and One-Year Mortality in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis.,2026,"Background/Objectives: Acute Pancreatitis (AP) is an unpredictable inflammatory disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality, particularly in severe forms. Early death is primarily linked to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and Multi-Organ Failure (MOF). The objective of this study was to identify objective clinical and laboratory predictors of early and one-year mortality in AP patients and to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of commonly used severity scoring systems. Methods: This prospective, observational study enrolled 50 adult patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the University Hospital Center Bezaniska Kosa. Patients with chronic pancreatitis, trauma-induced AP, or late presentation were excluded. Severity scores (APACHE II, BISAP, Ranson, Pancreas) and biomarkers (C-reactive protein, Procalcitonin) were collected at admission (0 h) and dynamically at 48 h, 72 h and day 7. Endpoints were early (in-hospital) and one-year mortality. Results: Overall mortality was 16% (n = 8). Mortality was significantly associated with sepsis/septic shock (p < 0.001), severe AP (p = 0.001), prolonged mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay. At admission, APACHE II (AUROC 0.813) and BISAP (AUROC 0.807) showed good accuracy. Reassessment at 48 h markedly improved prediction: APACHE II achieved excellent value (AUROC 0.917), and the Ranson score became a strong predictor (p < 0.001). Procalcitonin (PCT) was identified as a significant and superior predictor of mortality from 48 h onwards (p < 0.001), outperforming CRP. One-year survival was significantly shorter among patients with sepsis, septic shock, severe AP, and prolonged ICU stay. Conclusions: Dynamic assessment using clinical scoring systems, particularly APACHE II and BISAP within the first 48 h, provides reliable mortality prediction in acute pancreatitis. The presence of sepsis, severe disease, and the need for prolonged organ support are key mortality determinants. Serial PCT monitoring offers sensitive, incremental value for risk stratification and guiding intensive care decisions in both short- and long-term outcomes."
41515590,Exploring the Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum Mid-Regional Pro-Adrenomedullin in Tick-Borne Encephalitis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"Background: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide with vasoregulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its stable fragment, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), is a validated biomarker in sepsis and systemic infections, but its role in viral neuroinfections remains unexplored. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), is a major viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with long-term neurological sequelae. This study aimed to assess MR-proADM levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with TBE and to evaluate their diagnostic utility and pathophysiological significance. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 20 patients with confirmed TBE and 14 non-infectious neurological controls. MR-proADM concentrations were measured in paired CSF and serum samples using an ELISA assay. Statistical analyses included group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test), correlation analyses (Spearman's r), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation. Results: Serum MR-proADM levels at baseline (SER1) were significantly lower in TBE patients compared with controls (p = 0.0197). The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio differed significantly between groups (p = 0.0063) and showed the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.816, 95% CI 0.63-0.93; sensitivity 79%, specificity 80%). MR-proADM concentrations in CSF correlated with total CSF protein (r = 0.53), suggesting an association with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Strong reproducibility was observed for serum MR-proADM between sampling points (r = 0.83). Conclusions: MR-proADM levels in CSF and serum are altered in patients with TBE, indicating its potential as a biomarker of CNS infection and inflammation. The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio may serve as a sensitive indicator of blood-CSF barrier involvement, while decreased serum levels may reflect impaired systemic neuroprotective response. These findings highlight a possible role of ADM in neuroimmune regulation during viral encephalitis and warrant validation in larger prospective studies."

41509654,Integrating Mendelian randomization and multi-omics analysis unravels gut microbiota-driven metabolic mechanisms in sepsis and identifies diagnostic biomarkers through experimental validation.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome, remains a leading cause of global mortality due to its complex pathophysiology and the lack of specific diagnostic biomarkers. Recent evidence highlights intricate interactions between the gut microbiota, metabolites, and host inflammatory responses; however, the causal relationships and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We integrated Mendelian randomization (MR) with multi-omics approaches (including transcriptomics, untargeted metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomics) to elucidate the causal relationships and underlying mechanisms between gut microbiota and their associated metabolites in the inflammatory response of sepsis. Building on this analysis, we employed machine learning algorithms to identify sepsis-specific diagnostic biomarkers derived from Prevotella 9, fatty acids, and PANoptosis-related genes. These key diagnostic genes were experimentally validated using a pulmonary sepsis organoid model. Seven gut microbiota taxa were identified as causally associated with sepsis, with Prevotella 9 demonstrating significant protective effects (odds ratio = 0.89, P = 0.01). The protective role of Prevotella 9 appears to be mediated through its regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Machine learning algorithms pinpointed three key diagnostic genes for sepsis: ABCC1, CYP1B1, and PPARG. Validation in an independent cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93) and the lung-derived organoid model confirmed their relevance. Functional analyses revealed that these genes are involved in immunometabolic pathways, including neutrophil regulation, oxidative stress, and macrophage polarization, and are predominantly expressed in monocytes. This study integrates MR and multi-omics analyses to reveal that Prevotella 9 may regulate sepsis through lipid metabolism. Additionally, three key genes (ABCC1, CYP1B1, and PPARG) were identified based on Prevotella 9, fatty acids, and PANoptosis, contributing to sepsis progression via the regulation of neutrophils, oxidative stress, and macrophage polarization. Monocytes may serve as potential cellular targets for sepsis."
41508097,Discovery of data quality issues in electronic health records: profound consequences for critical care medicine applications - a systematized review.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Electronic health records (EHRs) in critical care settings generate vast amounts of data that increasingly drive machine learning (ML) models for clinical decision support, yet data quality issues may have profound consequences for downstream prediction, classification, and optimization applications. This study aims to systematically examine EHR data quality issues in critical care medicine and their impact on ML model performance, clinical outcomes, and patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a systematized review following expert-based questions, searching MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Google Scholar, DBLP, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Six distinct questions addressed missing data patterns, temporal data quality, bias and health equity, multi-modal integration, real-time monitoring, and institutional variability.  RESULTS: 281 relevant studies examining EHR data quality in critical care settings. After applying the eligibility criteria, 29 studies were selected. EHR data quality issues in critical care were pervasive and multifaceted. Missing data rates exceeded 80% for some variables, with 40% of predictive features being missingness indicators rather than actual values. EHR-related medication errors comprised 34% of all medication errors in ICUs, with one-third having life-threatening potential. Copy-paste prevalence reached 82% in residents' progress notes. ML model performance degraded significantly under real-world conditions, with external validation showing AUC drops from 0.76 to 0.63 for sepsis detection models. Temporal data quality deteriorated throughout ICU stays, with vital sign quality degrading at 60-75% of average length of stay. CONCLUSION: Data quality issues in critical care EHRs create cascading effects that compromise ML model reliability, clinical decision-making, and patient safety. The evidence demonstrates an urgent need for systematic data quality monitoring, bias-aware assessment methods, and comprehensive quality improvement frameworks specifically designed for critical care environments.

41507830,Renal clearance of endogenous lithium as a marker of proximal tubule function in sepsis and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury : A prospective single-centre study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients are at high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Precise functional biomarkers may be useful for monitoring renal tubular function in patients at risk of sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) and to study its pathophysiology in vivo in humans. Lithium is passively reabsorbed in parallel with, and in proportion to, the reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubule. The unreabsorbed fraction is almost entirely excreted in urine, and the fractional excretion of lithium thus provides a semiquantitative estimate of proximal sodium reabsorption. We hypothesized that endogenous lithium reabsorption is impaired in the early stages of SA-AKI. The aim of study was to measure renal clearance of endogenous lithium in patients with SA-AKI and in patients with sepsis without AKI. METHODS: Ten patients with SA-AKI and eight patients with non-AKI sepsis were studied, all without premorbid chronic kidney disease. Blood and urine samples were obtained at 8 AM, 2 PM and 8 PM over the course of a single study day and within the first 48 h after admission to the intensive care unit. Fractional excretion of lithium (FE(Li)) was calculated, and linear mixed-effects model statistics were applied to analyse data. RESULTS: FE(Li) was higher in the SA-AKI group compared with the non-AKI group (estimated mean difference 8.26%, p = 0.008) with median (interquartile range) FE(Li) 7.5 (4.6-14.8) % and 3.0 (1.3-4.5) %, respectively. Excluding patients receiving diuretics did not alter the estimated mean FE(Li) difference (8.79%, p = 0.004). Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, mean arterial pressure, and peak values for C-reactive protein were similar between groups (p = 0.98, 0.43, and 0.52, respectively). SOFA score and peak creatinine concentration during the entire hospital stay were significantly higher in the SA-AKI group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate an efficient proximal tubular sodium reabsorption in the sepsis group without AKI, and significantly lower reabsorption in the SA-AKI group. Measurement of endogenous lithium clearance may become useful for studies of proximal tubule function in critically ill patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05982340). Date of registration: 31.7.2023."
41507797,Persistent stress hyperglycemia trajectories predict mortality in sepsis: a machine learning-enhanced cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Stress-induced hyperglycemia is a common metabolic derangement in sepsis linked to adverse outcomes. However, the prognostic significance of the dynamic trajectories of the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) remains poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the MIMIC-IV database. The SHR was calculated at six time points within the first 24 h of ICU admission. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify distinct SHR trajectory phenotypes. The associations between these trajectories and in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality were assessed using multivariable logistic and Cox regression models. The prognostic value of SHR trajectories was further validated using multiple machine learning models. RESULTS: Among 1,834 patients with sepsis, four distinct SHR trajectories were identified: 'Low-Stable', 'Moderate-Stable', 'High-Improving', and 'High-Persistent'. The 'High-Persistent' trajectory group displayed the highest inflammatory burden, greatest organ dysfunction, and worst mortality rates. After multivariable adjustment, the 'High-Persistent' trajectory was independently associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.42-2.86), in-hospital mortality (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25), and 90-day mortality (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.37-2.63; all P < 0.001). Feature selection algorithms consistently identified the SHR trajectory as a key predictor of mortality. The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model, which incorporated the SHR trajectory, achieved excellent discrimination for 28-day mortality with an AUC of 0.863. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic SHR trajectories identify distinct prognostic phenotypes in patients with sepsis. A persistently elevated SHR is a powerful, independent predictor of mortality, signifying a state of sustained and maladaptive metabolic stress. Integrating SHR trajectory analysis, particularly within machine learning frameworks, holds significant promise for advancing early risk stratification and personalizing glycemic management in critical care.

41505903,Clinical effectiveness of procalcitonin- or C-reactive protein-guided antibiotic discontinuation protocols for adult patients who are critically ill with sepsis: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are a first-line treatment for sepsis, with guidelines recommending a 7- to 10-day course. Prolonged antibiotic use carries significant risks, prompting growing interest in using inflammatory biomarkers, such as procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, to guide clinical decision-making on the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. This rapid systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of using procalcitonin- or C-reactive protein-guided protocols for antibiotic discontinuation in patients who are critically ill with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches for articles published after January 2005 in relevant databases. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials comparing procalcitonin- or C-reactive protein-guided protocols for antibiotic discontinuation with standard care, or with each other. Primary outcomes were duration of antibiotic therapy and mortality. Secondary outcomes included infection recurrences; secondary infections or superinfections; and the duration of intensive care and hospital stays. RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible studies. Moderate certainty evidence from 19 trials, involving 6382 patients, indicated that procalcitonin-guided protocols probably reduced antibiotic therapy by, on average, 2.0 days (95%CI -2.6 to -1.4) compared with standard care. Moderate certainty evidence from 18 trials, involving 6228 patients, suggested an average 5% reduction in mortality risk when using procalcitonin-guided protocols compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.95, 95%CI 0.83-1.07). The evidence regarding C-reactive protein-guided protocols versus standard care approaches remained unclear, with very low to low certainty evidence available. DISCUSSION: Combining relevant trials suggests that procalcitonin-guided discontinuation protocols may be both safe and effective for patients who are critically ill with sepsis, with no increased risk in mortality. In contrast, the evidence supporting C-reactive protein-guided protocols is limited. These findings underscore the potential importance of utilising procalcitonin to inform antimicrobial stewardship practices, particularly in critical care settings."
41504481,Clinical effect of in-house rapid diagnostic process on patients with bloodstream infections due to carbapenem-resistant bacteria or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a prospective cohort study.,2026,"Bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria result in a high mortality rate. Little research has been carried out to analyze the clinical effects of laboratory-based rapid identification and susceptibility tests of the types of organisms responsible for these infections. We previously developed an ammonium chloride-based in-house workflow for direct pathogen identification and susceptibility testing from positive blood cultures, eliminating the need for subsequent overnight subculturing. In this study, we carried out a prospective single-center cohort study evaluating the outcomes associated with in-house rapid detection of carbapenem-resistant bacterial strains or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus directly from positive blood cultures. From 2018 to 2023, 584 patients with clinically significant monomicrobial bloodstream infections due to these strains were enrolled. Among the 584 patients, 412 were included in the final analysis, with 182 in the in-house group and 230 in the conventional group. The median time from positive blood culture to identification and susceptibility results was significantly shorter for the in-house rapid process than for the conventional process (P < 0.01). A decrease in laboratory report time improved the time to effective antibiotic therapy and increased the adjustment rate of effective antibiotics from 56.09% (129/230) to 70.33% (128/182) (P < 0.01). The 28-day all-cause mortality after occurrence of a bloodstream infection markedly decreased from 19.57% (45/230) to 9.34% (17/182) (P = 0.005). Our results indicate that the in-house rapid process improves the time to effective antibiotic therapy and significantly decreases patient mortality. This information should encourage the implementation of our in-house rapid diagnostic process for bloodstream infections. IMPORTANCE: In this study, we included only patients whose bloodstream infection was caused by carbapenem-resistant bacterial strains or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, avoiding the interference of empirical treatment for sensitive strains and allowing a clearer evaluation of the effects of laboratory-based rapid workflows. Moreover, this study covered all bloodstream infection cases from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2023, with patients randomly grouped to minimize confounding factors. The results of this study demonstrated that this laboratory-based rapid workflow significantly shortened laboratory reporting times, which led to improvements in the rate and timing of adjustment of effective antibiotic therapy and a significant decrease in the mortality of patients with bloodstream infections. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have employed such a procedure to analyze clinical effects. Therefore, we believe that our research findings will encourage the implementation of laboratory-based rapid diagnosis for bloodstream infections."
41504062,METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Ferroptosis in Sepsis-Associated Acute Lung Injury - A Narrative Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) represents a complex and life-threatening condition with limited therapeutic options. Recent research has unveiled the role of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in exacerbating ferroptosis via m6A-insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets. This study delves into the implications, challenges, and prospects of this intricate molecular pathway in sepsis-associated ALI. METTL3-mediated M6A modifications assume a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. These modifications exacerbate ferroptosis, a regulated cell death process characterized by iron-dependent oxidative damage to lipids. The involvement of m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming adds another layer of complexity to this mechanism, offering potential therapeutic avenues. Understanding the intricate network of METTL3-mediated m6A modifications, IGF2BP2, and mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming poses a formidable challenge. Developing interventions that modulate this pathway while minimizing off-target effects remains a significant hurdle. Patient-specific responses and identifying reliable biomarkers further complicate the clinical translation of these findings. The unraveling of this molecular pathway holds promise for personalized medicine approaches in ALI management. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions based on individual patient profiles may significantly enhance clinical outcomes. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including researchers, clinicians, and drug developers, is essential to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and clinical applications."
41503298,Septic Myocarditis Masquerading as Acute Inferior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,2025,"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a rare and alarming presentation in adolescents, particularly in women. We report the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with classic symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, including severe retrosternal chest pain, ST-segment elevations on ECG, and a significantly elevated troponin I level (18 ng/mL). The ECG showed evidence of ST elevation in inferior leads, suggestive of inferior STEMI. Urgent coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, effectively ruling out coronary occlusion. The diagnostic pivot was guided by concomitant fever, hypotension, profound leukocytosis (40,900/microL), and a markedly elevated procalcitonin level (11.1 ng/mL). Blood cultures were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe global left ventricular dysfunction (35%). Despite negative blood cultures, a diagnosis of septic shock with secondary septic myocarditis was made based on the overwhelming clinical and biomarker evidence. Initiation of antibiotic therapy led to rapid clinical improvement within 72 hours, accompanied by complete resolution of ST-segment elevations. This case underscores septic myocarditis as a critical mimic of STEMI and highlights the importance of a normal angiogram in redirecting management toward life-threatening infectious etiologies."
41501643,"Vital signs as biomarkers of early clinical deterioration in pediatric emergency departments: physiology, interpretation, and innovations: a narrative review.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Early recognition of pediatric deterioration is difficult because age-dependent physiology and compensation mask early shock and safety risks. This narrative review compares vital-sign (VS) biomarkers (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature) with laboratory markers and clinical indicators. METHODS: We searched Embase, Pubmed, and guideline repositories to August 2025 for pediatric studies from emergency, inpatient, and critical-care settings. We summarized accuracy, timeliness, and implementation issues, prioritizing cohort and implementation evaluations. RESULTS: Age-adjusted, repeated, and continuous analyses of VS-especially multivariate approaches such as shock index pediatric age-adjusted and heart-rate-characteristics analytics-outperformed single thresholds, often anticipating ICU transfer or sepsis by hours. Laboratory biomarkers provided diagnostic specificity for defined syndromes but were slower and unsuitable for continuous surveillance. Composite scores (e.g., PEWS, ED-PEWS, National PEWS) showed moderate to high discrimination yet performed best when integrated with trends and standardized escalation pathways. CONCLUSION: VS biomarkers, leveraged as dynamic trends and combined with context, enable earlier, safer detection of pediatric deterioration than static thresholds or isolated laboratory tests. Priorities include validating continuous models beyond NICUs, ensuring equity and calibration across different ages and comorbidities, and testing wearable sensors and EHR-embedded alerts in pragmatic trials that measure timeliness, unintended harms, and patient-centered outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41500561,Machine learning-based cardiovascular risk calculator for non-cardiac surgery.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Annually, 4% of the global population undergoes non-cardiac surgery, with 30% of those patients having at least one cardiovascular risk factor. It is estimated that the 30-day mortality is between 0.5% and 2%.The main objective of this study is to develop a traditional machine learning (ML) model that provides a cardiovascular risk score for patients older than 50 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery, calculating the risk from the date of surgery until 30 days post surgery, with specific emphasis on interpretability and explainability of the model's decision-making process. METHODS: The NSQIP 2022 dataset was used to build the model. It consisted of a total of 4 97 011 patients after data cleaning. The primary clinical endpoint was death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest or stroke at 30 days postoperatively, which occurred in 1.44% of the patients. Different preprocessing techniques were performed for data cleaning and feature selection. The cleaned data were then used to model the selected learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and boosting Decision Tree algorithms (CatBoost, AdaBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting). These models were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and their corresponding 95% CI. RESULTS: For classification, the trained models were evaluated using AUROC on the test set. LightGBM achieved the highest AUROC of 0.9009 with a 95% CI of 0.8889 to 0.9126. The model consisted of six data elements: type of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiology classification, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), sepsis, emergent surgery and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: In our study, LightGBM classifier proved to be the best model for cardiovascular risk scoring, demonstrating a strong balance between prediction accuracy and generalisation."
41500293,"Changing in blood cells for infection detection: ""Monocyte distribution width"" acts as a key determinant in differentiating localized and blood stream infections.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of bloodstream infections (BSI) in the Emergency Department (ED) remains a clinical challenge. Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW), a novel biomarker available from the complete blood count, was prospectively evaluated for its diagnostic and prognostic utility in patients with suspected infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study enrolling 608 adult ED patients. Following a comprehensive diagnostic workup, patients were retrospectively adjudicated into three primary groups: No Infection (n = 196), Localized Infection (n = 235), and Bloodstream Infection (BSI) (n = 134). The diagnostic accuracy of MDW was compared to procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In this cohort, MDW demonstrated high accuracy for BSI detection (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.936), representing a statistically significant improvement over both PCT (AUC = 0.818; p < 0.0001) and CRP (AUC = 0.829; p < 0.0001). It also showed good accuracy in discriminating localized infections from the no-infection group (AUC = 0.748). Notably, among the biomarkers tested, MDW was the only biomarker significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors (p = 0.001), indicating a unique prognostic value for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In ED patients with suspected infection, MDW is a highly effective biomarker for the early detetion of BSI, demonstrating significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than PCT and CRP in this study. Its ability to help stratify patients with localized versus systemic infection and to predict mortality makes it a valuable tool for early risk assessment and clinical decision-making."
41499330,Extracellular Vesicles for Acute Care Testing: A Review of Potential Laboratory Applications.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Rapid, accurate diagnosis in acute and emergent care remains a major challenge, with delays directly impacting patient outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanoscale membranous particles secreted by all cell types and found in virtually all biological fluids, have the potential to transform acute diagnostics as minimally invasive biomarkers. As key intercellular messengers and carriers of biological cargo, EVs reflect the physiological and pathological states of their parent cells. While EV research has largely focused on chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, their role in acute pathologies remains under-investigated. CONTENT: This review describes the current landscape of EVs in laboratory medicine, with a focus on their potential for acute and emergent conditions, including sepsis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and myocardial infarction. We examine advances in EV isolation and characterization techniques and discuss the unique challenges of implementing these approaches in a clinical setting. In particular, we highlight emerging technologies that aim to address existing barriers, including lack of standardization, long processing times, and limited clinical scalability. SUMMARY: By summarizing existing knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this review intends to refocus attention toward EV applications for acute care. As EV-based diagnostics continue to advance, their successful integration into clinical work flows has the potential to significantly transform healthcare delivery, enabling real-time, personalized diagnostics and improving health outcomes across a wide range of settings."
41497347,Copper-Induced Cell Death in Renal Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.,2025,"Copper dyshomeostasis and the resulting induction of cuproptosis, a novel regulated cell death pathway driven by mitochondrial copper overload, play a critical role in renal pathophysiology. Cuproptosis is characterized by FDX1-mediated copper reduction, irreversible aggregation of lipoylated TCA cycle enzymes, such as dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, and destabilization of iron‒sulfur cluster proteins, leading to proteotoxic mitochondrial collapse. The kidney's high vulnerability arises from its filtration and metabolic functions. This review consolidates evidence linking cuproptosis to various renal disorders, including acute kidney injury (eg, sepsis-induced, cisplatin-induced, and ischemia-reperfusion injury), diabetic nephropathy through mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation, and chronic kidney disease involving podocyte damage or context-dependent dysregulation in fibrosis and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Notably, cuproptosis and ferroptosis interact synergistically through shared mechanisms, where glutathione depletion or iron overload exacerbates both pathways, while mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation create a self-perpetuating injury cycle. Emerging diagnostic strategies utilize cuproptosis-related biomarkers for early detection, supported by various prediction models. In therapeutic contexts, copper chelators, transporter modulators, and dual-pathway inhibitors targeting both cuproptosis and ferroptosis mitigate renal damage in preclinical models. Dietary interventions that modulate copper bioavailability also hold promise. However, challenges remain, including identifying renal cell type-specific mechanisms, developing noninvasive biomarkers, optimizing kidney-targeted nanotherapeutics, and preventing iatrogenic copper deficiency. Future research may focus on translational applications and the physiological roles of cuproptosis in renal repair. Targeting cuproptosis offers a promising avenue for innovative diagnostics and treatments in nephrology."
41497039,Implantable biosensors for continuous sepsis detection in postoperative care.,2026,"Implantable biosensors are emerging as transformative tools for real-time sepsis surveillance in postoperative patients. By continuously monitoring key inflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines and endotoxins, these systems can enable earlier diagnosis and intervention than traditional intermittent testing. Technological advances such as active-reset DNA-aptamer biosensors for cytokine tracking and electrochemical lipopolysaccharide sensors achieving attogram-level sensitivity illustrate rapid progress in the field. Research across the United States, Europe, and Asia highlights the growing global commitment to integrating biosensors into perioperative monitoring. Their application across surgical specialties may fundamentally shift postoperative care from reactive to predictive management, reducing sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Ongoing research into wireless communication, long-term biocompatibility, and multiplexed sensing will be pivotal to clinical translation and adoption in both high- and low-resource healthcare systems."
41496084,The predictive value of the lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio for mortality in patients with septic shock.,2026,"Septic shock is a life-threatening condition with high mortality despite advances in intensive care. Identifying reliable and easily obtainable biomarkers is essential for early risk stratification. Lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LAR), which combines 2 routine laboratory tests, has recently been suggested as a prognostic marker in sepsis. To investigate the predictive value of LAR for 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock. This retrospective study included 93 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit of the Second People's Hospital of Hefei. Patients were categorized into survival (n = 41) and non-survival (n = 52) groups based on their 28-day outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare demographics, clinical indicators, and treatments. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to assess the relationship between LAR and mortality. Patients were stratified into high- and low-LAR groups using the optimal cutoff identified by the RCS model. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were used to compare 28-day survival between groups. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences between the survival and non-survival groups in terms of age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, intensive care unit length of stay, LAR, blood urea nitrogen, lactic acid, white blood cell count, mechanical ventilation, and norepinephrine use. Multivariate analysis identified LAR and white blood cell count as independent risk factors for mortality. RCS analysis demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between LAR and all-cause mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1 at a LAR value of 10.1. Patients in the high-LAR group (>/=10.1) had significantly lower 28-day cumulative survival compared to those in the low-LAR group (<10.1; P = .011). LAR is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock, with higher values associated with increased risk. Patients with elevated LAR (>/=10.1) should be closely monitored. However, as this was a retrospective single-center study with a relatively small sample size, the findings should be interpreted cautiously, and larger prospective studies are warranted."
41496073,Machine-learning model for 30-day mortality in sepsis-associated delirium patients: A retrospective MIMIC-IV cohort study.,2026,"Patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) are particularly vulnerable to the onset of sepsis-associated delirium (SAD), which is associated with an increased mortality rate. This retrospective cohort study employed machine-learning algorithms to develop a risk-prediction model for 30-day mortality in ICU patients with SAD. Patients with SAD in ICU were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. Patients were classified into 2 groups: those who survived and those who did not, based on 30-day mortality following ICU admission. The patient data included in this study were subsequently divided into the training and validation sets. The Boruta algorithm was used to identify significant feature indicators. Predictive models have been developed, including logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and naive Bayes. The performance of these models was assessed using a validation set. The final machine-learning model incorporated the Shapley additive explanation method (SHAP) to enhance the interpretability of predictive outcomes. In total, 5390 patients were diagnosed with SAD using the MIMIC-IV database. The XGBoost model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy and was chosen as the final model, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.743 for the validation set. Using the SHAP method, the top 15 significant features were identified in the XGBoost predictive model. The SHAP analysis identified blood urea nitrogen, age, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and history of stroke as the top predictors of mortality. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance in forecasting 30-day mortality among ICU patients with SAD. In contrast to conventional predictive models, this machine-learning approach enables the prediction of 30-day mortality within 24 h of patient's admission. However, the model's low specificity may limit its clinical utility, and external validation is needed."
41494967,Protective role of PCED1B-expressing naive CD4+ T cells in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a global health challenge associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Early diagnosis and treatment are challenging because of the limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to identify effective biomarkers for diagnosing and treating sepsis through an integrated multi-method approach. METHODS: Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq datasets were analyzed for naive CD4+ T cell-specific genes. Based on these hub genes, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, followed by the MR-Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) algorithm, was implemented to explore the causality between these genes and sepsis. In addition, single-cell-type expression analysis, cell-cell communication detection, metabonomic evaluation, clinical samples, and both in vivo and in vitro studies were conducted to unveil the underlying mechanisms of potential therapeutic targets. RESULTS: scRNA-seq revealed significant depletion of naive CD4+ T cells in sepsis, identifying 33 key genes. Both MR and MR-BMA analyses confirmed that elevated proportion of naive CD4+ T cell in total CD4+ T cells (naive CD4+ T cell % CD4+ T cell) were related to sepsis occurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.97, P = 0.007) and 28-day mortality associated with sepsis (OR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.64-0.88, P <0.001). Notably, among the 33 hub genes, PC-esterase domain containing 1B (PCED1B) exhibited a strong causal association with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.51-0.81, P <0.001), which was further validated by bulk RNA-seq analysis. PCED1B mediated the impact of proportion of naive CD4+ T cell in CD4+ T cell on sepsis-related mortality. In addition, clinical samples and both in vivo and in vitro experiments validated the elevated expression of PCED1B in naive CD4+ T cells derived from sepsis patients and mice. Mechanistic investigations revealed PCED1B+ CD4+ T cells may interact with monocytes/dendritic cells through the MIF-(CD74+CD44) axis, concurrently engaging with B cells/plasmablasts through the MIF-(CD74+CXCR4) axis, thereby regulating multiple metabolic alterations in sepsis. CONCLUSION: The interplay between PCED1B and naive CD4+ T cells, as revealed by this study, is instrumental in developing immunotherapeutic strategies for sepsis."
41494198,Plasma apolipoprotein E levels and sepsis risk based on multi-center cohorts and multi-omics validation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care, with limited reliable biomarkers that reflect upstream pathophysiology and enable early risk stratification. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter with immune-regulatory functions, has shown inconsistent associations with sepsis outcomes. Its causal and clinically actionable role in sepsis risk requires clarification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a multi-layered strategy integrating Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and phenome-wide association studies across five large proteogenomic cohorts (>500,000 individuals) to identify plasma proteins causally linked to sepsis. ApoE emerged as a top candidate and was validated in a clinical cohort of 291 ICU patients and in murine sepsis models. We assessed the relationship between ApoE levels and sepsis risk using logistic regression, restricted cubic spline models, and survival analyses, and explored underlying mechanisms via cytokine profiling, histopathology, and transcriptomics. RESULTS: ApoE was causally associated with sepsis risk in multiple independent datasets, supported by strong genetic colocalization (posterior probability for shared causal variant PP.H4 > 0.80). In ICU patients, both low (adjusted OR 12.74, 95% CI 5.72-28.36) and high ApoE levels (adjusted OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.25-9.16) were independently associated with increased sepsis risk compared to medium levels, forming a significant U-shaped pattern (P_nonlinear < 0.001). This biphasic risk was mirrored in murine models, where both hypo- and hyper-expression of ApoE aggravated systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality. LDL cholesterol mediated only ~ 20% of the ApoE-sepsis association, indicating lipid-independent mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Plasma ApoE functions as a biphasic, dose-sensitive modulator of host response to sepsis. Both deficiency and excess disturb immune homeostasis and increase susceptibility, underscoring the need for precision-guided ApoE modulation in sepsis management. These findings provide a mechanistically grounded biomarker candidate and highlight new avenues for personalized therapy. Prospective trials are warranted to evaluate ApoE-targeted strategies in sepsis care."
41492360,Sepsis Endotypes Defined by Lymphocyte Thresholds and Inflammation Inform Precision Immunomodulation.,2026,"Immunomodulatory therapies demonstrate variable efficacy in sepsis, suggesting biological heterogeneity inadequately captured by current stratification approaches. Although lymphopenia predicts mortality, functional thresholds and their interaction with inflammation remain poorly characterized. We investigated whether integrating lymphocyte status with systemic inflammation defines sepsis endotypes with differential treatment responsiveness. We retrospectively profiled 714 patients within 24 h using lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory biomarkers. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed nonlinear associations between lymphocyte counts and mortality (p < 0.01), with steep risk increases at lower counts. Risk optimization identified critical thresholds at 374 cells/microL (total T cells), 340 cells/microL (CD4(+)), and 157 cells/microL (CD8(+)). Principal component analysis of inflammatory markers combined with lymphocyte stratification classified patients into four discrete endotypes with markedly divergent 28-day survival (55%-58% vs. 82-87%, p < 0.001). Patients with immunosuppressed/hypo-inflammatory endotype had higher survival among those who received corticosteroids (CD4(+)-depleted: 84.4% vs. 75.6%, p < 0.001; T-cell-depleted: 78.7% vs. 72.3%, p = 0.006), whereas hyperinflammatory endotypes showed no such association. Integration of publicly available single-cell (GSE167363) and bulk transcriptomics (GSE65682) datasets yielded a 15-gene T-cell dysfunction signature with external validation (CNP0004962, area under the curve [AUC] 0.76-0.85). These observational findings suggest that immune-inflammatory co-profiling identifies biologically distinct sepsis subgroups with differential treatment associations, generating testable hypotheses for prospective validation through endotype-guided trials."
41491985,Research trends and ethical perspectives on explainable artificial intelligence in emergency medicine: a bibliometric analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly relevant for ensuring transparency, interpretability, and trust in clinical decision support systems. In emergency medicine, where decision-making is time-critical and data are often incomplete, XAI provides significant opportunities while also raising ethical and methodological challenges. Despite the rapid growth of AI applications in acute care, bibliometric studies explicitly integrating explainability and ethics remain limited. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis of 433 publications on XAI in emergency medicine was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection. The search covered 1986 through November 2025 and included peer-reviewed research articles and reviews in English related to emergency medicine, artificial intelligence, explainability, and ethics. Bibliometric indicators (publication trends, citation counts, journals, authors, and countries) were analyzed using Bibliometrix (R), while VOSviewer was used to visualize thematic clusters and keyword co-occurrence. Citations were analyzed as cumulative counts up to November 2025 and normalized to per-publication counts per year. RESULTS: Research output increased sharply after 2018, peaking in 2023 with approximately 90 publications, reflecting the growing focus on interpretability and transparency in emergency care. Cumulative citations exceeded 1,400 by 2025. The United States, the United Kingdom, and China were the most productive countries. Annals of Emergency Medicine, NPJ Digital Medicine, and BMJ Open were the most influential journals, while Ong M.E.H., Dwivedi G., Stewart J., Wang Y., and Li J. emerged as leading contributors. Thematic mapping revealed four major clusters: (1) methodological development of interpretable models, (2) clinical applications in triage, imaging, and sepsis risk prediction, (3) ethical and human-factor dimensions (bias, accountability, transparency), and (4) emerging topics such as large language models. Despite rapid progress, most studies remained retrospective and lacked standardized interpretability metrics, multicenter validation, and consistent reporting of explainability outputs. CONCLUSION: Research on XAI in emergency medicine is expanding rapidly and is increasingly shaped by a small group of influential journals and authors. However, critical gaps remain, including the limited availability of prospective studies, insufficient clinician involvement, and ethical frameworks that are not yet fully tailored to emergency settings. Addressing these gaps through multidisciplinary collaboration, standardized evaluation metrics, and stronger governance will be important to support transparency, accountability, and the safe clinical adoption of XAI in emergency medicine."
41491968,Downregulation of USP39 in sepsis reflects immune dysfunction and offers diagnostic and prognostic value.,2026,"BACKGROUND: USP39 is involved in mRNA splicing and stress responses. This study analyzed USP39 expression and its clinical relevance in sepsis, aiming to provide a novel treatment target for sepsis. METHODS: The RNA-seq datasets were used for analyzing the expression profile and clinical significance of USP39 in both sepsis and control groups. Functional pathway enrichment was performed using GSEA and GSVA with the clusterProfiler package (3.14.3). Immune infiltration was evaluated via single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). The prognostic value of USP39 was assessed utilizing Cox regression, and its diagnostic performance was determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis employing the survival (3.5.7) and pROC (1.18.5) packages, respectively. For single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (GSE175453), we performed quality control, normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), batch correction, clustering, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization employing the Seurat 4.4.0 package. THP-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic septic injury. USP39 was overexpressed via pcDNA3.1 transfection. Cellular assays were conducted to measure cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). RESULTS: Our study found that USP39 was significantly downregulated in sepsis patients and was associated with age, diabetes, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-acquired infections. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that high USP39 expression was linked to metabolic processes, primary immunodeficiency, and spliceosome, and immune response and inflammation pathway. In addition, USP39 also exhibited a high diagnostic value and was identified as an independent prognostic marker in sepsis. ssGSEA revealed higher infiltration of CD8(+) T cells, activated B cells, and CD4(+) T cells in the high USP39 expression group, while Th17 and NK cells were more abundant in the low USP39 expression group. According to the results of scRNA-seq analysis, USP39 exhibited significant differential expressions in monocytes and T cells, with low expression observed in sepsis. Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirmed that overexpression of USP39 significantly enhanced cell viability and suppressed apoptosis in LPS-induced THP-1 cells while also inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: The significant downregulation of USP39 was correlated with both clinical features and immune infiltration in sepsis, highlighting its role in immune regulation and its potential as a prognostic biomarker."
41491686,Reduced SNHG16 promotes sepsis-induced intestinal injury via the miR-15a-5p/AKT3 axis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an infection-induced syndrome that is challenging to treat. Sepsis-induced intestinal injury can accelerate sepsis and increase patient mortality. SNHG16 is associated with the progression of sepsis. Therefore, this study explored the role of SNHG16 in sepsis-induced intestinal injury. This study aimed to provide valuable insights into the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced intestinal injury. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from sepsis patients and healthy controls. Sepsis-induced intestinal injury cell model was constructed by treating Caco-2 cells using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The qRT-PCR was used to measure lncRNA, miRNA, and gene expression. The biological functions of biomolecules on intestinal cells were estimated using flow cytometry, transwell permeability assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The oxidative stress status was measured using the antioxidant activity assay. ELISA measured inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism was investigated using dual luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: In sepsis patients, SNHG16 downregulation discriminated patients with intestinal injury. SNHG16 downregulation led to upregulated expression of miR-15a-5p, which further led to downregulated expression of AKT3. The cell experiments showed that SNHG16 protected intestinal cells from the injury induced by LPS. MiR-15a-5p mediated the damaging impact of SNHG16 downregulation on intestinal cells. MiR-15a-5p affected intestinal cells by downregulating AKT3. CONCLUSION: The downregulation of SNHG16 mediated the injury effect of LPS on intestinal cells by upregulating miR-15a-5p and further targeting AKT3. SNHG16 was a diagnostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for sepsis-induced intestinal injury."
41491575,Mitochondrial-related biomarkers as the diagnostic markers in sepsis induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2026,"Previous study found that mitochondrial might correlate with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, this study aimed to find the effect of mitochondrial-related biomarkers in sepsis-induced ARDS. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were firstly screened in sepsis-induced ARDS datasets and intersected with mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) to create differentially expressed-MRGs (DE-MRGs). Based on DE-MRGs, three machine learning algorithms were further performed to yield feature genes, the intersections of feature genes were conducted expression analysis. Those genes with significant difference of expression were identified as biomarkers for nomogram construction and immune infiltration. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was processed to annotate cell subpopulations, the expression of biomarkers was evaluated in different cell subpopulations. Finally, the expression of biomarkers was validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Relied on comprehensive analysis, three biomarkers (ARID4B, RGS2, TGM2) related to mitochondrial were acquired for sepsis-induced ARDS. A nomogram was then constructed relied on biomarkers, and verified to have an excellent performance. Analysis of immune infiltration showed that naive B cells and CD8(+) T cells had significant difference between different groups. Neutrophils were likewise found to be positively correlated with RGS2 (cor = 0.39, p < 0.05). 13 distinct cell subpopulations were annotated, and RGS2 had the highest expression in myofibroblast. Finally, the expression of ARID4B and RGS2 was stably downregulated in sepsis-induced ARDS. In this study, three biomarkers (ARID4B, RGS2, and TGM2) for sepsis-induced ARDS were found, which provided theoretical basis for the diagnose and treatment for the disease."
41489866,"Association of 41 circulating inflammatory factors, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin with sepsis risk and 28-day mortality: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.",2026,"BACKGROUND: The precise causal relationship between circulating inflammatory factors and sepsis has not yet been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To identify biomarkers that enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis of sepsis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The causal relationships between 41 circulating inflammatory factors, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) with sepsis and 28-day sepsis-related mortality were evaluated using two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. RESULTS: This study revealed negative causal associations between genetically predicted circulating inflammatory factors-interleukin-6 (IL-6) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.923; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.854-0.998; p = 0.044), RANTES (OR = 0.926; 95% CI, 0.862-0.994; p = 0.033), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP1beta) (OR = 0.957; 95% CI, 0.919-0.996; p = 0.032) - and the risk of sepsis. Furthermore, positive causal relationships were observed between CRP and sepsis (OR = 1.140; 95% CI: 1.055-1.232; p = 0.001), as well as between CRP and 28-day sepsis-related mortality (OR = 1.241; 95% CI: 1.034-1.489; p = 0.020). Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) levels were also elevated in sepsis (OR = 1.136; 95% CI: 1.003-1.286; p = 0.044). Mediation analysis indicated that CRP mediated the effects of IL-6 and RANTES on sepsis, accounting for 25.87% (OR = 0.980; 95% CI: 0.961-0.998) and 2.04% (OR = 1.002; 95% CI: 0.991-1.012) of the total effect, respectively. The robustness of these associations was confirmed through leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and funnel plots. CONCLUSIONS: This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sepsis and its associated mortality, and underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammatory factors in its management."
41488103,Diagnostic potential of extended inflammation parameters for sepsis identification: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: An early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is critical for improving patient outcomes. Extended inflammation parameters (EIPs), derived from routine complete blood count (CBC) analysis, have emerged as promising biomarkers for inflammatory response. This study aimed to explore the diagnostic potential of a model combining several EIPs for identifying sepsis in a case-control setting. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center, case-control study was conducted at Tawam Hospital, AlAin, United Arab Emirates involving 157 participants; 53 patients with confirmed sepsis per Sepsis-3 criteria admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 104 control participants from outpatient clinics with no obvious evidence of infection. EIPs, including immature granulocyte count (IG#), neutrophil reactivity intensity (NEUT-RI), and reactive lymphocyte percentage per lymphocyte (RE-LYMP%/L), were retrieved from initial CBCs performed on a Sysmex XN-1000 analyzer. A three-parameter logarithmic model was developed, and its performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap iterations to estimate bias-corrected performance. RESULTS: The logarithmic model, i.e., log(IG# + 1) + log(NEUT-RI/100 + 1) + log(RE-LYMP%/L/50 + 1), combining IG#, NEUT-RI, and RE-LYMP%/L demonstrated high apparent discrimination for identifying sepsis, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.902-0.980), a sensitivity of 88.5% (95% CI: 77.0-95.8%), and a specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 84.2-96.0%). Bootstrap internal validation yielded an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.874-0.966), with minimal optimism (0.018), suggesting model stability within this dataset. CONCLUSION: A prediction model combining three different EIPs demonstrated high discrimination in a case-control setting, however this design of comparing ICU sepsis patients to healthy outpatient controls introduces severe spectrum bias characteristic of two-gate studies, which can inflate discrimination metrics significantly when compared with single-gate Emergency Department populations where diagnostic uncertainty is genuine. These results should be considered preliminary exploratory findings only. The extreme spectrum bias inherent to our case-control design means reported performance reflects statistical discrimination in an artificial scenario rather than real-world diagnostic accuracy, with expected ED performance substantially lower (estimated AUC 0.70-0.79). Rigorous prospective validation in consecutive ED patients with suspected infection, including head-to-head comparison with established biomarkers procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, is essential before any clinical consideration."
41488071,The association between coagulation function and prognosis in patients with sepsis: a meta-analysis of predictive performance introduction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units, is associated with coagulation dysfunction, a key pathological feature linked to multi-organ failure. However, the prognostic value of coagulation markers remains heterogeneous across studies. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients, focusing on their predictive performance. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, nine studies (n = 1954) were included from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The associations of coagulation markers (APTT, PT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, INR) and SOFA scores with the outcome were quantified using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Diagnostic accuracy was summarized by the area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic, and a random-effects model was employed to account for between-study variation. The robustness of the findings was evaluated through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Fibrinogen showed a significant inverse correlation with mortality [OR = 0.76, 95% CI (0.59-0.97)], while INR demonstrated moderate predictive ability (AUC = 0.68). APTT and PT had non-significant ORs but moderate AUCs (0.75 and 0.75, respectively). D-dimer and SOFA score ORs were non-significant, though SOFA's AUC indicated good prognostic utility. High heterogeneity (I (2) > 74%) and sensitivity to individual studies were noted. CONCLUSION: Specific coagulation markers, notably fibrinogen and INR, may aid in sepsis prognosis assessment, but variability across studies limits generalizability. Further high-quality studies are warranted to validate these findings. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251049209, identifier CRD420251049209."
41485778,Intelligent monitoring to predict atrial fibrillation (NOTE-AF): clinical study 1 for the 'Health virtual twins for the personalised management of stroke related to atrial fibrillation (TARGET)' project - a protocol for a prospective cohort analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide affecting an estimated 5% of people over the age of 65 and is a leading cause of stroke and heart failure. Identification of patients at risk allows preventative measures and treatment before these complications occur. Conventional risk prediction models are static, do not have flexibility to incorporate dynamic risk factors and possess only modest predictive value. Artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered health virtual twin technology offer transformative methods for risk prediction and guiding clinical decisions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this prospective observational study, 1200 patients will be recruited in two tertiary centres. Patients hospitalised with acute illnesses (sepsis, heart failure, respiratory failure, stroke or critical illness) and patients having undergone high-risk surgery (major vascular surgery, upper gastrointestinal surgery and emergency surgery) will be monitored with a patch-based remote wireless monitoring system for up to 14 days. Clinical and electrocardiographic data will be used for modelling the risk of new-onset AF. The primary outcome is episodes of AF >30 s and will be described as ratio of episodes/patient and as percentage of patients having episodes of AF. Secondary outcomes include 30-day and 90-day readmission rates and complications of AF.The aim of this study is to generate data for the development and validation of health virtual twins predicting onset of AF in an at-risk population. The intelligent monitoring to predict atrial fibrillation (NOTE-AF) study is part of the TARGET project, a Horizon Europe funded programme which includes risk prediction, diagnosis and management of AF-related stroke (https://target-horizon.eu/). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval by the Health Research Authority and the National Research Ethics Service (REC reference 24/NW/0170, IRAS project ID: 342528) in the UK and has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06600620). Results will be disseminated as outlined in the TARGET protocol to communicate project ideas, activities and results to diverse audiences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06600620."
41484650,Association between hemoglobin glycation index and mortality in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a critical illness with high intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Traditional glycemic markers like hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) poorly reflect individual glucose metabolism variability. The hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), derived from the discrepancy between measured HbA1c and values predicted by fasting plasma glucose (FPG), assesses glycometabolic variability but remains unstudied in critically ill COPD patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort enrolled 1,125 critically ill COPD patients admitted to the ICU, with data derived from the MIMIC-IV database. HGI was calculated as measured HbA1c minus predicted HbA1c (model: HbA1c =  - 0.0095 x FPG + 5.02) and divided into tertiles. Cox regression models, adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and clinical parameters, evaluated HGI tertile associations with 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) and threshold analysis explored nonlinear relationships. RESULTS: Among 1,125 patients, higher HGI tertiles were independently associated with lower mortality at all timepoints. In multivariable-adjusted Model II (age, sex, ethnicity, hematocrit, hemoglobin, SOFA score, SAPS II score, corticosteroid use, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation, diabetes), compared to the lowest tertile (T1), T2 and T3 showed significantly reduced mortality. For the 30-day mortality, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.77, P = 0.0012) for T2 and 0.69 (95% CI 0.46-0.98, P = 0.0396) for T3; for the 90-day mortality, the HRs were 0.59 (95% CI 0.42-0.80, P = 0.0015) for T2 and 0.68 (95% CI 0.50-0.96, P = 0.0274) for T3; and for the 365-day mortality, the HRs were 0.67 (95% CI 0.51-0.87, P = 0.0108) for T2 and 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.96, P = 0.0277) for T3, all of which showed significant decreasing trends (all P for trend < 0.05). RCS analysis identified a nonlinear relationship between HGI and 30-day mortality (threshold: HGI = 0.865), with HGI increases below this threshold reducing mortality, and no association above it. Subgroup analyses showed no significant interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HGI levels are independently associated with higher short- and long-term mortality in critically ill COPD patients, with a nonlinear threshold effect. HGI may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker, highlighting the need for personalized glycometabolic management."
41483497,Elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling correlates with myocardial PANoptosis in septic rats.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction driven by dysregulated host responses to infection. While PANoptosis-a coordinated cell death pathway-has emerged as a critical process in inflammatory diseases, its role in sepsis and regulatory interactions with the miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis remains unexplored. This study aimed to determine PANoptosis activation in sepsis, elucidate the mechanistic involvement of miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB in PANoptosis regulation, and assess associated pathological outcomes. METHODS: Cross-dataset analyses revealed functional linkages between miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling and PANoptotic pathways. Clinical validation included serum collection from sepsis patients and healthy controls, with miR-145 quantified via qPCR and PANoptosis-related proteins measured by ELISA. A rat sepsis model was established via cecal ligation and puncture, followed by miR-145 expression profiling, PANoptotic factor detection, and myocardial histopathological evaluation using HE/TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Results demonstrated significant upregulation of miR-145, TLR4, NF-kappaB, PANoptotic markers, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis patients versus controls. CLP rats exhibited parallel increases in these biomarkers alongside pronounced myocardial injury, including histopathological disruption and elevated apoptosis. Correlation analyses confirmed miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis activation as a key modulator of PANoptosis and tissue damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of PANoptosis activation in sepsis, indicating a correlative link with elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling. These findings propose a novel pathogenic framework for sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and highlight therapeutic targets for modulating inflammatory cell death pathways."
41482786,"Prognostic value of T-lymphocyte subsets, lymphocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in patients with septic shock and effects of vitamin C on patients with septic shock.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock remains a critical condition with high mortality, necessitating reliable prognostic biomarkers and effective adjunct therapies. OBJECTIVES: This study explored prognostic biomarkers and the effect of vitamin C in septic shock. METHODS: This study analyzed 110 patients (January 2023-March 2024), stratified by 28-day outcome into survival (n=90) and death (n=20) groups. Compared to survivors, the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio (LHR), CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ and higher interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), CD3+CD8+. RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed the combination of LHR, IL-6, CRP, PCT and CD4+/CD8+ predicted death best [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) =0.960], outperforming single markers. Patients were randomized to control (hydrocortisone) or observation (hydrocortisone with vitamin C) group. Post-treatment, both groups showed improved mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) (increased), heart rate (HR) (decreased) and reduced PCT, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; however, improvements were significantly greater in the vitamin C group. CONCLUSION: The combination of LHR, IL-6, CRP, PCT and CD4+/CD8+ has prognostic value. Vitamin C adjunct therapy significantly enhances hemodynamic improvement, reduces inflammation, lowers SOFA scores and improves prognosis in septic shock patients."
41481256,Target-Combined Enhanced Coordination and Steric Hindrance Enable One-Pot Visual Rapid Quantification of Histone.,2026,"Histones are critical biomarkers associated with the severity and mortality of sepsis. In this study, a one-pot, highly sensitive dual-mode fluorescence assay for histone detection was developed by leveraging enhanced coordination and steric hindrance effects. Histones can specifically bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), generating complexes with multiple metal ion coordination sites. Therefore, Cu(2+) was introduced to react with the histone-dsDNA complexes, and the strong steric hindrance produced by the complexes could inhibit reactions between Cu(2+) and other molecules. Moreover, quantum dots (QDs) selectively recognize dsDNA-Cu(2+) and histone-dsDNA-Cu(2+) complexes. Hence, histones were quantitatively analyzed by measuring the fluorescence recovery intensity of QDs. Under optimized conditions, the detection limits of histones were 2.3 fg/mL in the fluorescence mode and 3.8 fg/mL in the red, green, and blue (RGB) mode. A total of 56 clinical serum samples were analyzed; the areas under the curve for discriminating infectious diseases and sepsis were 0.978 and 0.934, respectively. This study developed a sensitive and accurate histone detection assay for patients with clinical infections, demonstrating promising potential for the stratification of infectious diseases and the early auxiliary diagnosis of sepsis."
41480135,Statistical Study for the Prognostic Value of NLR Values in Patients with Severe Burns: A Study in the Service of Burns in Albania.,2025,"The phases of burn care include initial resuscitation, definitive wound management, and rehabilitation of physical and psychological injuries. In severe burns, this response lasts for the first two to three days post-burn and burns larger than 15% of total body surface area lead to the initiation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory biomarker that can indicate systemic inflammation. NLR is defined by the absolute number of neutrophils divided by the absolute number of lymphocytes. Many studies have been done in severe burn patients because they reflect changes in the systemic inflammatory response. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NLR values in patients with severe burns and provide clinical guidance for sepsis and mortality. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Service of Burns of the University Hospital Centre ""Mother Teresa"" in Tirana (UHCT), Albania. We compared NLR levels in burn patients with sepsis and without sepsis. Our data showed a significantly higher level of NLR in burn patients with sepsis, while the values of NLR on the 3rd day (NLR 3) have statistical significance (p<0.0001). From the logistic regression analysis, we found that only NLR 3 can predict mortality, whose cut-off (4.59) was determined with the help of ROC curve analysis and was accurately presented with the help of Kaplan-Meier curves with statistical significance. From multiple regression, we understand that mortality can be predicted based on TBSA%, age, presence of inhalatory burn, and NLR 3 together."
41478161,Ensemble machine learning for early mortality risk stratification in septic orthopedic trauma: an international cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a life-threatening complication in severe orthopedic trauma, significantly increasing short-term mortality risk. Despite the clinical urgency for early prognosis assessment, current predictive tools remain inadequate. To address this gap, this study used a machine learning (ML)-based framework for mortality risk stratification in this high-risk population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study established ML models to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with orthopedic trauma and sepsis. Data from 2,060 eligible patients were extracted from the intensive care unit (ICU) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2008-2019) in the United State and randomly split into training (80 %) and internal validation (20 %) sets. After handling missing data and addressing class imbalance, seven ML algorithms (including CatBoost [Categorical Boosting], RF [Random Forest], and SVM [Support Vector Machine]) were trained and optimized using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed based on discrimination (AUC [Area Under the Curve], accuracy, F1-score), calibration (Brier score, calibration slope), and clinical utility. The top-performing models were further validated on an independent external Chinese cohort (n = 273, 2020-2024). RESULTS: The study cohort had a mean age of 62.8 years and a 30-day mortality rate of 19.9 % (410/2060). Non-survivors were significantly older, had a higher comorbidity burden, and more severe physiological derangements. The LASSO analysis identified 16 prognostic variables, with age, hematologic parameters (RDW, WBC), SOFA scores, hemodynamic measures (SBP), and antihypertensive therapy emerging as significant predictors. Among all models, the CatBoost algorithm demonstrated superior performance in the internal validation set, achieving the highest AUC (0.955), accuracy (0.884), and F1-score (0.878), along with excellent calibration (Brier score: 0.081). A soft voting ensemble model, integrating the top three algorithms (CatBoost, RF, SVM), was subsequently constructed. In external validation, this ensemble model generalized robustly, maintaining strong discrimination (AUC: 0.842, Accuracy: 0.737) and calibration (Brier score: 0.173), outperforming the standalone CatBoost model. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis provided interpretable, individualized risk assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This study trains, optimizes, and evaluates a high-performing ML-based prediction model for 30-day mortality in patients with critical orthopedic trauma and sepsis. The CatBoost model and the soft voting ensemble, particularly the latter, demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical utility, offering a potential tool for early risk stratification and personalized management in this vulnerable population."
41478040,"SERS on analyte-enriched blood for rapid, culture-free sepsis recognition and causative pathogen identification with super operational neural networks.",2026,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, yet routine diagnostics are slow, culture-dependent, and often lack the sensitivity or specificity required for early intervention. Prior studies rarely demonstrate clinical-grade performance on blood culture samples or in independent external cohorts. We address these gaps with a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and deep learning workflow (SERS-DL) that performs sepsis instance recognition and causative pathogen identification directly from target-analyte enriched blood. We assembled a primary dataset of SERS spectra acquired from 653 analyte-enriched blood samples collected at a tertiary hospital in Qatar and an external blind cohort of 70 independent samples. After rigorous preprocessing and class-weighted augmentation of SERS spectra, we trained SuperRamanNet, a lightweight one-dimensional classifier based on super operational neural networks. In five-fold, sample-contained cross-validation, the system achieved 99.67 % accuracy for binary sepsis recognition and 98.84 % accuracy for six-class pathogen identification. On the external cohort, performance remained high at 98.28 % for pathogen typing, indicating robust generalizability. Comparative benchmarks and ablation studies confirmed consistent gains over convolutional and operational baselines and quantified the impact of augmentation and architectural choices. Residual confusions were concentrated between control and Escherichia coli and among certain Gram-negative classes, underscoring the need for improved raw class balance during blood sample collection. Overall, this rapid, culture-free, and portable SERS-DL pipeline delivers near clinical-grade accuracy for sepsis detection and pathogen identification directly from blood. The compact model and streamlined workflow support point-of-care translation, with potential to accelerate triage, guide early therapy, and reduce the global sepsis burden."
41477766,Aromatic microbial metabolite hippuric acid enhances inflammatory responses in macrophages via TLR-MyD88 signaling and lipid remodeling.,2026,"The gut microbiome produces diverse metabolites shaping immunity, yet their pro-inflammatory potential remains unclear. Using untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, we identified hippuric acid-an aromatic, microbe-derived metabolite-as a potent enhancer of inflammatory responses during Escherichia coli infection. Hippuric acid administration heightened inflammation, activated innate immune cells, and reduced survival in infected mice. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] or LPS+interferon gamma [IFNgamma]) macrophage pro-inflammatory responses but had no effect on M2-like (interleukin [IL]-4) polarization. It enhanced responses to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands but not TRIF-, STING-, or NOD2-mediated stimuli. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abolished hippuric-acid-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed increased cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid accumulation, while reducing cellular cholesterol blunted the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid. Notably, hippuric acid also enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with sepsis mortality, linking microbial metabolism, lipid remodeling, and innate immunity."
41476946,Bacterial cell-free DNA profiling reveals the co-elevation of multiple bacteria in newborn foals with suspected sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, yet current diagnostics lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Here, we present a foal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing for bacterial identification (cfFBI) workflow that integrates wet-lab and computational protocols, enabling direct bacterial profiling through enrichment of the bacterial cfDNA and minimization of false-positive detections. We applied cfFBI to blood from 25 hospitalized foals and 7 healthy foals (H). Sepsis-associated bacterial genera were elevated in all 11 nSIRS-positive (S+) foals compared to H, and in 8/11 when compared to both nSIRS-negative (nS-) and H, with multiple genera elevated in nearly half (45.5%). While total cfDNA concentration, bacterial fraction, and microbial diversity did not differ between groups, S+ foals showed distinct cfDNA end-motif patterns and reduced mitochondrial cfDNA fractions. These findings indicate that cfDNA sequencing enables the detection of pathogenic bacteria and can help identify additional (host-related) sepsis biomarkers."
41476761,Plasma Bile Acid Profiling Reveals Novel Early Diagnostic Biomarkers for Pediatric Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early detection remains a challenge. While bile acids have been implicated in various diseases, their role as biomarkers for sepsis is underexplored. This study aims to identify metabolites associated with sepsis and assess the potential of bile acids for early diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric sepsis. METHODS: We enrolled 100 participants in the discovery phase and 141 participants in the validation phase. Non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites between sepsis patients and healthy controls. Targeted quantitative analysis of 12 plasma bile acids (BA) was conducted to assess their concentrations. Machine learning algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine-RFE (SVM-RFE), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), were employed to identify key BAs for sepsis diagnosis. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics revealed bile acid pathway dysregulation, validated by targeted quantification showing elevated primary bile acids-cholic acid (CA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA)-and taurine-conjugated secondary bile acid TDCA (p<0.05). Conversely, secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA) were significantly reduced (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression identified TCA, TDCA, GCA, TCDCA, GCDCA, and TDCA/DCA as risk factors for sepsis, while LCA, DCA, UDCA, GUDCA, and DCA/CA were protective factors. Five machine learning models identified four bile acid indicators-UDCA, GUDCA, GCA, DCA-as key predictors for sepsis diagnosis, with a combined model area under the curve (AUC) of 0.880. Additionally, DCA/CA and GCDCA were important predictors for septic shock, with risks increasing by 4.5% (OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.009-1.081) and 30% (OR = 0.700, 95% CI: 0.526-0.932), respectively. LCA was a risk factor for respiratory failure in sepsis, with an OR of 2.154 (95% CI: 1.022-4.540). CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential of bile acid profiling as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pediatric sepsis. These findings suggest a path toward early intervention, improving patient outcomes by enabling timely detection and treatment."
41476244,Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: recent insights on the role and clinical application of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.,2025,"Sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection. Neutrophils play a vital role in this process, which can lead to immunothrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This study aimed to validate the impact of NETs biomarkers in evaluating their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic indicators in critical care for patients with sepsis. We conducted a case-control study with a 7-day follow-up to assess mortality in 138 sepsis patients, focusing specifically on the occurrence of DIC. Additionally, 80 healthy volunteers, matched by age and sex, served as controls. Our findings reveal a strong connection between histones in sepsis and both the initial inflammatory response and sepsis-related coagulopathy/DIC. Furthermore, we found that myeloperoxidase can effectively predict short-term mortality among sepsis patients, regardless of their DIC status. This study highlights a concerning simultaneous increase in myeloperoxidase and histones (thresholds of > 84.9 ng/ml and > 126.4 ng/ml, respectively), which may serve as vital indicators indicating the urgent need for NETs inhibitors in sepsis treatment. Applying this approach, we anticipate a significant reduction in thrombotic events and mortality, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes in the management of critical sepsis."
41475067,Shared inflammation in takotsubo syndrome and sepsis: Lipocalin-2 mediates neutrophil infiltration and cardiac damage.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) and sepsis often co-occur with poor outcomes, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Transcriptomic analysis is employed to detect diagnostic biomarkers and reveal shared pathophysiological mechanisms in sepsis-associated TTS. METHODS: Myocardial gene expression data (TTS, sepsis, and controls) from GEO were analyzed to identify shared differentially expressed genes. WGCNA and PPI networks were used for candidate gene selection. Key genes were further refined using random forest and LASSO algorithms. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT. Myocardial injury and gene expression in rat models were evaluated using HE staining, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blotting. Clinical validation was conducted using plasma samples from the China TTS Registry. t-tests and ANOVA were conducted via GraphPad Prism 8 software. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was recognized as an important biomarker through WGCNA, PPI network analysis, and machine learning algorithms, showing strong predictive performance. Its expression was significantly associated with neutrophil infiltration and myocardial injury in TTS. Consistent with the bioinformatics findings, the TTS-sepsis comorbidity model showed elevated mRNA and protein levels of LCN2 in myocardial tissue, accompanied by increased neutrophil infiltration and severe cardiac injury. Clinical validation confirmed elevated plasma LCN2 levels in patients with sepsis-associated TTS, correlating with neutrophil counts, NT-proBNP, and cTnI levels. CONCLUSION: LCN2 is identified as a key inflammatory mediator linking neutrophil-driven inflammation to myocardial injury in sepsis-associated TTS, with dual potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target."
41473675,"Analysis of PANoptosis-related genes in septic cardiomyopathy by bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation.",2026,"The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) are intricate and incompletely understood. PANoptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death, and in the present study, bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation were used to identify key PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) associated with SCM. Differentially expressed genes were obtained through analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, and these genes were intersected with the PRGs to obtain the differentially expressed PRGs. Three machine learning algorithms were used to screen key PRGs; CIBERSORT was used for immune infiltration analysis and the diagnostic value of key PRGs was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves. Additionally, a competitive endogenous (ce)RNA regulatory network analysis was conducted, and drug prediction analysis was performed. Finally, the expression of key PRGs was verified via quantitative PCR. A total of 157 differentially expressed genes and 21 differentially expressed PRGs were screened. In addition, two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm and the random forest algorithm, with both genes demonstrating a high diagnostic value. RIPK2 and GADD45B were positively correlated with neutrophils. The ceRNA regulatory network included two mRNAs, eight microRNAs and 16 long noncoding RNAs and 10 drugs/molecular compounds were predicted. Finally, quantitative PCR results revealed that the expression of both RIPK2 and GADD45B was upregulated in the lipopolysaccharide-induced HL-1 cell injury model. In conclusion, the present study identified two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) associated with SCM; these findings may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for SCM."
41473019,Development of a Piezoelectric Immunosensor to Rapidly Measure Prohibitin‑1 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Sepsis and Other Serious Infectious Diseases.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and the leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly when an affected patient develops multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a serious complication defined as progressive and potentially irreversible dysfunction in two or more organ systems. Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that patient outcomes with sepsis would improve if the risk for MODS and mortality could be identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms. We present an approach leveraging quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology for rapid ( approximately 30 min) detection of prohibitin-1 (PHB1), a protein with pleiotropic biological function that dramatically increases in blood during the acute phase of an infection. The feasibility of detection and reproducible quantification of recombinant PHB1 in physiological buffered conditions is described. Sensitivity and detection limit for the third overtone (12.19 Hz mug(-1) mL and 59.06 ng/mL, respectively) were determined to be within the physiological range, highlighting the QCM-D immunosensor's potential for applied use in plasma samples. Importantly, there was strong concordance between PHB1 concentration curves generated using the QCM-D immunosensor and those from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which typically requires 36 h. Our findings illustrate a feasible and reproducible method to detect a bloodborne protein using immunosensor technology that has the potential to improve patient outcomes in sepsis and other serious infectious diseases."
41472805,The role of gut microbiota in the onset and development of sepsis and its therapeutic potential: mechanisms and research progress.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease triggered by infection-induced immune dysregulation, characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, and is one of the leading causes of death among critically ill patients worldwide. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance plays a crucial role in the progression of sepsis. This review identifies the core mechanisms of GM imbalance: it disrupts the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, induces bacterial and endotoxin translocation, activates systemic inflammatory responses, and forms a vicious cycle of ""gut-organ"" cross-damage, becoming a key driver of sepsis-associated multi-organ dysfunction. Existing research has confirmed that microbiota modulation strategies, such as probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have potential therapeutic value. However, due to issues like strain specificity, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient clinical evidence, the clinical translation of these strategies still faces significant barriers. Therefore, future research should focus on the identification of sepsis-specific GM core functional biomarkers, the development of personalized combined regulatory strategies, and the advancement of targeted delivery technologies. Multi-center large-scale clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety, providing innovative solutions for precision treatment of sepsis."
41472734,Identification and validation of core biomarkers for sepsis: a comprehensive analysis using bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to infection, requires timely and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Despite advances in medical research, identifying reliable biomarkers for sepsis remains a challenge. This study aims to identify and validate key biomarkers for sepsis, addressing the limitations of current diagnostic methods like the SOFA score, PCT, and CRP, particularly in terms of specificity and early detection. METHODS: We recruited 23 sepsis patients and 10 healthy controls, collecting peripheral blood samples for mRNA sequencing. Public datasets (GSE134347, GSE167363, and GSE220189) were also utilized for differential gene expression analysis. The expression and functions of these biomarkers were systematically verified through GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network construction, ROC curve analysis, AUC values of machine-learning models, survival analysis, and immune cell subset localization analysis. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified four core biomarkers-CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163-as significantly differentially expressed in sepsis patients. ROC curve and AUC analyses of machine-learning models showed AUC values exceeding 0.9 for these biomarkers across seven models, indicating superior diagnostic performance. Survival analysis revealed significant associations of KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 with sepsis prognosis. Specifically, higher expression levels of RETN and CD163 were linked to increased mortality risk, whereas higher KLRB1 levels were associated with decreased mortality risk. Immune cell-specific expression localization showed CD27 expression in T cells, KLRB1 in NK cells, RETN in monocytes and neutrophils, and CD163 in monocytes, indicating a cell-type-based immune regulatory network. CONCLUSION: CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 form a dynamic immune network that reflects the pathological progression of sepsis from hyper-inflammatory to immunosuppressive phases. Monitoring the expression changes of these biomarkers can accurately assess patients' immune status and guide clinical interventions, such as anti-inflammatory or immunostimulatory therapies. This study offers new directions for early diagnosis and individualized treatment of sepsis."
41472638,"Diagnostic Performance of Biomarkers Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, and Procalcitonin in Neonatal Sepsis: A Case-Control Study.",2025,"Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with diagnosis complicated by nonspecific clinical signs and limited reliability of conventional laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT) with traditional sepsis screening parameters in neonates. This hospital-based case-control study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a North Indian tertiary care medical university between September 2023 and March 2025. A total of 300 neonates were screened, of which 100 were diagnosed with sepsis (cases) and the remaining 200 served as controls. Sepsis screening, TNF-alpha, IL-6, PCT, and blood culture were performed to diagnose neonatal sepsis. Results of this study showed significantly higher levels of all tested biomarkers and sepsis parameters in cases compared with controls. Among biomarkers, TNF-alpha demonstrated the highest accuracy [area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.99, sensitivity 94%, specificity 100%], followed by PCT (AUROC 0.82, sensitivity 80%, specificity 82.5%) and IL-6 (AUROC 0.79, sensitivity 86%, specificity 74.5%). The study concludes that TNF-alpha is the most reliable biomarker for diagnosing neonatal sepsis, although a multimodal approach integrating conventional parameters with cytokines and PCT offers the best diagnostic yield. Combining early biomarkers with standard screening may improve early recognition, reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, and strengthen antimicrobial stewardship."
41472286,"Differences in the Phenotype of Bacterial and Viral Sepsis-A Prospective, Multicenter, Observational Study.",2025,"Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to an infection, leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction. While sepsis is most commonly the result of a bacterial infection, it may also be caused by viral pathogens. The aim of this study was to describe differences in organ dysfunction patterns and inflammatory markers between bacterial and viral sepsis. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, adults meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria were recruited from four Austrian ICUs between 1 August 2021 and 1 April 2024, excluding those who were immunocompromised within the preceding 12 months. Ninety patients were enrolled, of whom 57 had bacterial and 33 viral sepsis. Inflammatory markers, including IL-6 and PCT, were higher at ICU admission in bacterial sepsis. Adjusted linear regression confirmed bacterial etiology as the only significant predictor of higher 48 h peak IL-6 and PCT values. Patients with viral sepsis typically fulfilled SEPSIS-3 criteria through respiratory and cardiovascular SOFA components, while other organ dysfunctions were less frequent. Significant differences in the phenotype of bacterial and viral sepsis were observed, characterized by distinct inflammatory profiles and differing patterns of organ dysfunction. These findings may support the improved differentiation of bacterial and viral etiologies in sepsis."
41469754,Immune cell profiling supports early prediction of sepsis-associated acute kidney disease using a decision tree algorithm.,2025,"Sepsis is a major cause of acute kidney injury, progressing to sepsis-associated acute kidney disease (SA-AKD). This study explores SA-AKD prediction by combining immune cell profiling. Peripheral immune cell expression and phenotypes were analyzed in sepsis patients without (n = 97) and with (n = 41) SA-AKD, admitted to a hospital (2020-2022). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were measured, and a decision tree (DT)-based model was used to evaluate their predictive power in the training (n = 106) and validation (n = 32) cohorts. The DT model, incorporating naive Treg and CD56(dim) NK cells along with clinical parameters, showed high accuracy in predicting SA-AKD. The model using blood urea nitrogen as the first node reached 89.62% accuracy (sensitivity: 94.4% and specificity: 87.14%; area under the curve = 0.91). The model starting with creatinine showed 89.62% accuracy. Validation results confirmed an 81.25% accuracy. Profiling specific immune cells may enable pre-evaluation of SA-AKD."
41469631,Plasma presepsin as a predictor of mortality in patients with UTI-related severe infection: a single-center retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether plasma presepsin levels are a more reliable predictor of mortality than traditional infection biomarkers in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI)-related severe infection. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated 69 patients with UTI-related severe infection admitted to the emergency department between May 2022 and August 2023. Data on vital signs, plasma presepsin levels, procalcitonin (PCT) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and other laboratory values at admission were collected. The values of presepsin, PCT, CRP, and WBC count for predicting 28-day mortality were analyzed. Survivors and non-survivors were propensity score-matched in a 2:1 ratio based on age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, presepsin showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.716 for predicting 28-day mortality, surpassing that of PCT (0.641), CRP (0.488), and WBC count (0.433). Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk (hazard ratio, 1.026; p = 0.008). In the matched cohort, presepsin levels showed the highest AUROC (0.660), followed by PCT (0.584), CRP (0.496), and WBC count (0.436). CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk; this may be a valuable biomarker for identifying high-risk patients with UTI-related severe infection.

41468640,Construction and validation of a machine learning-based risk prediction model for invasive mechanical ventilation in AECOPD patients complicated with respiratory failure.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to create and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) complicated by respiratory failure. METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with AECOPD and respiratory failure were retrospectively extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). A total of 551 cases were split 7:3 into a training set (385 cases) for model construction and an internal validation set (166 cases). The IMV served as the outcome event. Features were selected with the Boruta algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Eight ML algorithms-XGBoost, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), LightGBM, CatBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (NN)-were trained with 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. An external validation cohort of 100 AECOPD-respiratory failure patients admitted to Baoying People's Hospital between January 2020 and August 2025 was collected. The final best model was interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to clarify feature importance and decision logic, and an interactive dynamic nomogram was plotted to increase readability. RESULTS: Boruta plus LASSO identified total calcium, partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and sepsis as significant predictors. XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an internal validation accuracy of 72.2%, sensitivity of 64.6%, specificity of 79.8 %, F1 score of 69.7% and AUC of 0.813 (95% CI 0.748-0.878). The external validation accuracy reached 76.4%, the sensitivity reached 82.6%, the specificity reached 70.0%, the F1 score reached 78.7%, and the AUC reached 0.840 (95% CI 0.801-0.879). SHAP analysis further indicated that PO(2) and SpO(2) were the primary drivers of model decisions. An interactive dynamic nomogram was successfully constructed. CONCLUSION: IMV in AECOPD patients with respiratory failure was associated with total calcium, PO(2), and SpO(2) levels and sepsis. The developed XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive value for IMV in this clinical population."
41466471,Alactic base excess as an early predictor of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early detection and intervention are essential for improving clinical outcomes. This study investigates the predictive utility of alactic base excess (ABE) as an early biomarker for SA-AKI within the first 24 h of hospital or emergency department admission. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India from May 2022 to April 2023. Adult patients (>/= 18 years) diagnosed with sepsis at hospital/emergency/intensive care unit (ICU) admission were enrolled. ABE was calculated at 0, 12, and 24 h after admission to hospital or emergency department by adjusting standard base excess for serum lactate levels. The primary outcome was the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Secondary outcomes included AKI severity, stratification by ABE ranges, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 369 enrolled patients, 159 (43%) developed AKI, and 66 (17.9%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Baseline ABE remained a significant independent predictor, with each 1 mmol/L increase (less negative value) associated with an 11% reduction in AKI risk (adjusted OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, p = 0.030). More negative baseline ABE values were significantly associated with both increased AKI incidence and mortality. ABE measurements at 12 and 24 h were not independently predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ABE is a cost-effective, easily obtainable biomarker that independently associates with SA-AKI and correlates with in-hospital mortality. Its early use in sepsis management may improve risk stratification and outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Multicenter validation is recommended. Trial registration number The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/07/044168), dated 20/07/2022."
41466195,Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) as a predictor of multiple organ dysfunction in pediatric critical care: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: RBC distribution width is a key variable in complete blood counts, associated with immature RBC release into circulation due to various processes, including systemic inflammation. RDW correlates with elevated acute inflammatory markers like ESR, CRP, and interleukin-6, and is a biomarker in conditions like kidney disease and multiple myelomas. It independently predicts disease severity in critically ill adults and is associated with morbidity, mortality and length of stay in pediatric intensive care unit, though its potential as an early biomarker for detecting pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) remains unknown. METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed PICU patients admitted to Aga Khan University Hospital from September 2018 to December 2022, excluding those admitted for less than 48 h for elective procedures, received recent RBC transfusions, or were anemic. RDW > 14.0% was considered elevated. MODS, defined as dysfunction in two or more organs, was the primary outcome. Data included demographics, PRISM III scores, laboratory values (RDW, BUN, creatinine, CRP, etc.), and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified into three RDW groups: <13.4%, 13.4-14.3%, and > 14.4%. Analysis focused on associations between RDW levels and MODS within the first 7 days of PICU admission. RESULTS: The study included 680 patients. Higher RDW was associated with younger age and higher PRISM III scores, but not with sex. RDW Group III had longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and higher incidence of MODS, but not significant. Hemoglobin and MCHC levels were lower in Group III, whereas BUN and creatinine levels showed no significant differences across groups. The OR for MODS was highest for Group II. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study evaluated the prognostic value of RDW in predicting length of stay, mortality, and early identification of MODS within seven days. Among 680 pediatric patients, higher RDW levels were associated with increased mortality, longer LOS, and higher rates of sepsis and MODS, though these findings lacked statistical significance. Elevated RDW was linked to inflammation and critical illness severity but did not correlate well with pediatric severity scores or MODS trends. Future multicenter studies are recommended to explore RDW's utility in predicting early organ dysfunction and critical illness outcomes."
41465881,Longitudinal Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Trajectories in Preterm Infants with Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS), defined as systemic infection occurring within the first 72 hours of life, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Increasing evidence indicates that the gut may play an active role in systemic inflammation, yet the temporal behavior of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during EONS has not been characterized. SCFAs and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are key microbial metabolites involved in epithelial maturation and immune regulation and may provide a non-invasive window into early inflammatory vulnerability. METHODS: This pilot prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolled 49 preterm infants (</=32 weeks' gestation) originally identified as at high risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and subsequently stratified into EONS and non-sepsis groups. Serial stool samples were collected at predefined timepoints (TPs; TP1  approximately  3 days of life [DoL], TP2  approximately  7 DoL, TP3  approximately  14 DoL, TP4  approximately  21 DoL, and TP5  approximately  28 DoL). Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify a panel of 12 SCFAs, including BCFAs and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Both absolute concentrations and relative fractions were evaluated, with emphasis on ratio-based metrics (e.g., acetic/propionic acid ratio) and timepoint-specific group contrasts, complemented by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: At the earliest sampling window (TP1), infants with EONS exhibited distinct early changes in SCFA composition, including a significantly lower median relative fraction of acetic acid (86.6% vs. 94.5% in non-sepsis), while several non-acetate components-including propionic, valeric, and branched-chain acids-were relatively enriched. Acetate-to-non-acetate ratios were markedly reduced in EONS (e.g., acetic/propionic and acetic/isobutyric ratios), indicating an early shift away from acetate dominance. PLS-DA at TP1 demonstrated partial separation between groups, with acetic-acid depletion and non-acetate enrichment among the strongest contributors to discrimination. By later TPs, these early differences narrowed to a small subset of BCFA-related ratios and largely attenuated by the end of the first month. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot cohort of preterm infants, EONS was associated with early, structured alterations in fecal SCFA profiles, characterized by reduced acetic-acid dominance and relative enrichment of non-acetate acids. Dynamic, ratio-based assessment proved more informative than absolute concentrations alone, revealing transient intestinal metabolic signatures accompanying systemic infection. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence of gut metabolic involvement in EONS and lay the groundwork for larger, multi-center studies integrating SCFA trajectories with microbiome and immune profiling to refine early risk stratification for systemic infection in high-risk neonatal populations."
41464553,Prognostic Value of 48-h Biomarker Changes in Sepsis Mortality.,2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Although various scoring systems and biomarkers have been studied, the prognostic significance of early dynamic changes in laboratory parameters remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of 48 h changes in routinely monitored biomarkers for in-hospital mortality in septic patients. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted in the Anesthesiology and Reanimation ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital. A total of 174 adult patients (>/=18 years) diagnosed with sepsis according to SEPSIS-3 criteria between January 2017 and December 2022 were included. Laboratory data were recorded at ICU admission and after 48 h. Patients who died within 48 h or had missing follow-up data were excluded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression models were used to assess the prognostic performance of clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: The median age was 71 years, and 58% of patients were male. Comorbidities were present in 76% patients, and malignancy was associated with higher mortality (p = 0.012). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 58.6%. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy significantly increased mortality risk (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had higher baseline SOFA and APACHE II scores. At 48 h, mortality was associated with increased procalcitonin, lactate, and CRP/albumin ratio and greater albumin decline. ROC analysis identified procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, albumin > 7% decrease, and CRP/albumin ratio > 31% increase as optimal cutoffs. Multivariate analysis revealed SOFA score > 6, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, and platelet > 37% decrease as independent mortality predictors. The change in albumin level was included in the model but was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Forty-eight-hour biomarker changes, particularly in lactate and platelet count, may provide complementary prognostic information to baseline SOFA scores and may support early risk stratification in sepsis. These findings should be considered exploratory and require confirmation in prospective multicenter studies before clinical implementation."
41463121,Proteomics Reveals Differential Diagnosis Biomarkers Between Sepsis and Hemophagocytic Syndrome.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) shares many clinical features with sepsis. To improve HLH diagnosis and its differential diagnosis with sepsis, serum proteomic analyses of healthy donors, HLH and septic patients were performed. Methods: Twenty-four individuals were enrolled in a label-free MS/MS spectrometry analysis. STRING was conducted to study the protein-protein interactions overrepresented within the proteins of each comparison. To integrate the functions of the proteins with their respective regulation patterns, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used. Validation of selected proteins was carried out by ELISA. Results: Proteomic results revealed 537 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between HLH and sepsis, 471 DEPs between HLH and healthy donors, and 37 DEPs between sepsis and healthy donors. These results were subjected to functional analysis, which showed that apart from inflammation and lipid metabolism, the proteostasis network was deeply impaired in the HLH condition. Considering this information, protein fold changes and the functions of six proteins were validated by ELISA. Conclusions: sCD300a, sCD300b and sCD25 could be specific serum biomarkers for HLH diagnosis, and SAA-1 and LRG1 might be useful biomarkers for differential diagnosis between sepsis and HLH. PSMB1, a non-catalytic subunit of the 20S proteasome, showed promising results for HLH-specific and differential diagnosis. Its elevation in HLH patients may reflect an intensified demand for protein turnover, possibly driven by a higher activation of the immunoproteasome. These insights contribute to expanding our understanding of HLH pathophysiology regarding new pathways and highlight innovative therapeutic interventions, such as Bortezomib and other next-generation inhibitors, designed to modulate immunoproteasome activity."
41462865,Quantification of the Actin-Binding Protein Flightless-I in Human Serum by Automated Western Blot System and Investigation of Its Diagnostic Potential in Sepsis.,2025,"Background: The actin-binding protein Flightless-I (Flii) has not been quantified in the human serum yet. We aimed to determine serum Flii levels in healthy individuals and to investigate Flii as a potential marker in patients with sepsis focusing on diagnosis, organ failures, and short-term mortality. Methods: A total of 30 controls and 64 septic and 22 non-septic patients were enrolled in this follow-up study. Serum Flii levels were quantified by using the capillary electrophoresis-based Simple Western system with chemiluminescent detection. The assay was calibrated by applying dilution series of a purified recombinant human Flii standard and a parallel internal standard. Results: Flii levels of healthy controls were found between 3.5 and 8.8 mg/L, while septic and non-septic patients showed significantly lower values (p < 0.001). First-day Flii could differentiate sepsis from the non-septic inflammatory state (AUC: 0.667; p < 0.05) and indicated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among septic patients (AUC: 0.686; p < 0.05). Furthermore, a combination of Flii and other sepsis markers seemed to offer an improved diagnostic performance (sepsis vs. non-sepsis, AUC of Flii + gelsolin (GSN) + Gc-globulin + procalcitonin: 0.974; p < 0.001 and ARDS vs. non-ARDS, AUC of Flii + GSN + presepsin: 0.776; p < 0.001) compared with single markers even in the prediction of 14-day mortality (AUC of Flii + GSN + Gc-globulin: 0.76; p < 0.001). Conclusions: We adapted a properly precise and reproducible automated Western blot method to determine concentrations of Flii in human serum. Our results revealed the relationship between Flii and sepsis; however, Flii alone did not appear to be a prominent sepsis marker. When combined with other biomarkers, measurement of serum Flightless-I may provide additional value supporting patient care."
41462719,"Predictive Value of CRIB II Score, Hematological Markers and Maternal-Fetal Risk Factors for Mortality in Neonatal Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Accurate early prediction of mortality is essential to improve clinical outcomes. The Clinical Risk Index for Babies II (CRIB II) and hematological indices such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have emerged as potential prognostic tools, but their performance in septic neonates has not been fully established. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 80 neonates diagnosed with sepsis at a tertiary referral hospital. Demographic, maternal, and laboratory data-including CRIB II, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), PLR, mean platelet volume (MPV), and red-cell distribution width (RDW)-were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine optimal cutoff values, and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Among the 80 neonates, 40 (50%) did not survive. Non-survivors had significantly higher CRIB II scores (median 5.0 [1.0-13.0]) than survivors (2.0 [0-7.0]) (p < 0.001). PLR and MPV were also elevated in non-survivors (PLR: 88.5 vs. 51.8, p < 0.001; MPV: 10.5 vs. 9.5, p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for mortality: CRIB II (AUC = 0.835; cutoff > 3.5; sensitivity 82.5%; specificity 78.0%) and PLR (AUC = 0.757; cutoff > 81.33; sensitivity 80.0%; specificity 70.0%). Multivariate analysis confirmed three independent predictors-PROM > 24 h (OR = 12.23; 95% CI: 2.05-73.11), PLR > 81.33 (OR = 91.02; 95% CI: 7.00-1184.29), and CRIB II > 3.5 (OR = 101.37; 95% CI: 4.50-2284.47). CONCLUSIONS: CRIB II and PLR are reliable, independent predictors of mortality in neonatal sepsis. Their integration with maternal factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes may improve early risk stratification and guide targeted interventions, particularly in resource-limited neonatal care settings."
41462702,Hydralazine Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Murine Myocardial Dysfunction by Inhibition of Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a fatal complication with limited therapeutic options. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) contributes to oxidative stress and leukocyte recruitment, yet its role in SIMD remains unexplored. This study investigates whether hydralazine, a potent SSAO inhibitor, protects against SIMD by evaluating the involvement of SSAO inhibition. Using a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis, hydralazine was administered 30 min post-injection. Over a 7-day observation period, survival rates, cardiac function (assessed by echocardiography), and myocardial injury (evaluated via plasma biomarkers including CK, CK-MB, LDH, and AST, alongside histopathology) were monitored. Additional analyses included measurements of oxidative stress markers (T-AOC, GSH-PX, SOD, MDA, GSH), inflammatory chemokine levels using a Luminex panel, and myocardial SSAO activity via HPLC. The results demonstrated that hydralazine at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly improved 7-day survival rates from 20% to 90% and enhanced cardiac function in septic mice. It also reduced myocardial injury and histological damage while attenuating systemic inflammation through suppression of chemokine elevation. Furthermore, hydralazine boosted systemic and myocardial antioxidant capacity and normalized the sepsis-induced increase in myocardial SSAO activity, suggesting a potential mechanism for its protective effects. In conclusion, hydralazine shows robust cardioprotection in experimental sepsis by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cell infiltration. The inhibition of SSAO activity may be a pivotal underlying molecular mechanism."
41462176,Maternal mortality in Ethiopia (2015-2025): a systematic review of recent evidence and determinants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Despite major policy reforms and improvements in healthcare coverage, maternal mortality remains a critical public health burden in Ethiopia. While progress has been made since the Millennium Development Goals era, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) still exceeds national and global targets. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from the past decade (2015-2025) to describe the magnitude, determinants, and regional disparities of maternal mortality in Ethiopia, highlighting persistent challenges and future priorities. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)), we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and African Journal Online(AJOL), supplemented with grey literature from World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health. Studies published in English between January 2015 and September 2025 was included. Data extraction followed standardized templates, and study quality was appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tools. Given methodological heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis approach was applied. RESULTS: A total of 61 studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing all Ethiopian regions. The pooled MMR was estimated at 366.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, showing only modest progress from previous decades. The leading causes of maternal death were obstetric hemorrhage (29.6%), hypertensive disorders (22.1%), sepsis (14.8%), obstructed labor (11.3%), and unsafe abortion (8.5%). Determinants aligned with the three-delay model: (1) delayed decision-making from low awareness and sociocultural barriers; (2) delayed access due to distance, transport, and cost; and (3) delayed care from health-system shortages and weak referral mechanisms. Socioeconomic inequality, inadequate antenatal care (< 4 visits), rural residence, and low maternal education consistently increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality in Ethiopia remains unacceptably high yet preventable. Persistent inequities, poor service quality, and health-system gaps continue to drive maternal deaths. Despite national initiatives such as the Health Sector Transformation Plan II (2015-2025) and the Maternal and Child Health Roadmap, progress is uneven. Achieving the SDG 3.1 target of < 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 demands stronger referral systems, equitable resource distribution, and quality-focused maternal health interventions. Targeted regional interventions and stronger Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) readiness are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3.1 target. Future research should integrate longitudinal, spatial, machine learning and Bayesian models to pinpoint high-risk areas and evaluate the impact of health-system reforms."
41462123,High-density lipoprotein 2b combined with sequential organ failure assessment score as a novel prognostic indicator for sepsis patients: a prospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a state of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to consecutive organ failure and lethal outcome. The purpose of this study is to assess the value of the combined use of plasma high-density lipoprotein 2b (HDL2b) level and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in predicting short-term mortality from sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in patients with sepsis and non-septic controls admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) from January 2020 to December 2021. SOFA scores were recorded on the first day after admission. Blood samples were collected from each enrolled patient and the levels of HDL2b were analyzed using microfluidic chip technology. Receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were conducted to determine the values of plasma HDL2b level, SOFA score and the combined HDL2b levels and SOFA score (HDL2b + SOFA) in predicting the prognosis of mortality, respectively. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcome was total in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Compared to non-septic controls, patients with sepsis had lower HDL2b levels (10.95% [8.95, 12.96] vs. 23.78% [14.53, 29.16], p < 0.001). Among sepsis patients, the levels of HDL2b of non-survivors were lower than those of survivors (6.74% [4.63, 8.08] vs. 11.78 [7.20, 13.40], p = 0.002). Moreover, our data also indicated that patients with higher HDL2b + SOFA scores shown higher rates of 28-day and total in-hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC curves for predicting 28-day mortality were 0.755 for HDL2b, 0.782 for SOFA, and 0.806 for HDL2b + SOFA. Multivariate analyses indicated that HDL2b + SOFA (Odd Ratio: 1.321 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.028-1.698), p = 0.029) was potential predictors of 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The HDL2b + SOFA composite score was a reliable predictor of 28-day and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients, showing better discriminatory ability than SOFA alone."
41462112,Monitoring immune cell dynamics for potential prognostic biomarker of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host immune responses. This study investigates dynamic changes in immune cells during sepsis progression and evaluates their utility as predictive biomarkers for sepsis prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, immune cells from 220 patients with sepsis were compared with those of 70 healthy controls. Patients with sepsis were stratified by 28-day outcome into survivors (n = 148) and non-survivors (n = 72). Immune cells included the counts and percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes; the percentages of CD3(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were also calculated. Immune parameters were monitored on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after sepsis diagnosis to characterize dynamic trajectories. RESULTS: The count and percentage of neutrophils, the count of monocytes, NLR, MLR and CRP in patients with sepsis were significantly increased, while the count and percentage of lymphocytes, the percentage of monocytes, the percentages of CD3(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells were lower as compared to the control. The NLR demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy for sepsis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.981 (95% CI: 0.965 ~ 0.998). The percentage of neutrophils achieved an AUC of 0.980 (95% CI: 0.958 ~ 1.000). The percentage of neutrophils and NLR performed comparably to CRP and outperformed other immune cell indices. The count of monocytes on day 7, the percentage of monocytes on day 7 and 21, the count of lymphocytes on day 7 and 14, the percentage of lymphocytes on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were lower than those in the survival group. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were higher than that in the survival group. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes in the survivors of sepsis trend upward over time. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR show potential as a prognostic biomarker for sepsis and may be useful to predict 28-day hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Day 7 may represent a critical window for prognostic assessment in sepsis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-12048-1."
41461922,Microbial collagenase activity is linked to oral-gut translocation in advanced chronic liver disease.,2026,"Microbiome perturbations are associated with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD), but how microorganisms contribute to disease mechanisms is unclear. Here we analysed metagenomes of paired saliva and faecal samples from an ACLD cohort of 86 individuals, plus 2 control groups of 52 healthy individuals and 14 patients with sepsis. We identified highly similar oral and gut bacterial strains, including Veillonella and Streptococcus spp., which increased in absolute abundance in the gut of patients with ACLD compared with controls. These microbial translocators uniquely share a prtC gene encoding a collagenase-like proteinase, and its faecal abundance was a robust ACLD biomarker (area under precision-recall curve = 0.91). A mouse model of hepatic fibrosis inoculated with Veillonella and Streptococcus prtC-encoding patient isolates showed exacerbation of gut barrier impairment and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, faecal collagenase activity was increased in patients with ACLD and experimentally confirmed for the prtC gene of translocating Veillonella parvula. These findings establish mechanistic links between oral-gut translocation and ACLD pathobiology."
41461844,Elevated lactate-to-albumin ratio predicts short- and long-term mortality in trauma and surgical intensive care patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV cohort study.,2025,"The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR), as a composite biomarker of integrated metabolic stress and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated prognostic utility in critical illnesses like sepsis and acute pancreatitis. However, its role in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (SICU/TSICU) patients remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between LAR and mortality in SICU/TSICU patients. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database. Adult SICU/TSICU patients with lactate and albumin measurements within 24 h of admission were included. Exclusion criteria were: repeat ICU admissions, ICU stay < 24 h, and missing lactate or albumin data. Ultimately, 2,665 patients were categorized into quartiles based on LAR. Multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and Kaplan-Meier analyses were employed to evaluate the relationship between LAR and 28-day and 365-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed interactions and robustness. The 28-day mortality and 365-day mortality rates reached 17.94% and 31.26%, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that elevated LAR independently predicted higher mortality risks (adjusted HR = 1.26, 95% CI:1.19-1.33 for 28-day; HR = 1.20, 95% CI:1.14-1.26 for 365-day), with a dose-response relationship across quartiles (P for trend < 0.001). RCS analysis showed a nonlinear association between LAR and 28-day mortality (P for nonlinear = 0.032). The 365-day RCS analysis demonstrated a significant overall positive association between LAR and mortality risk (P for overall < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency and robustness. Elevated LAR shows significant association with both short- and long-term mortality in SICU/TSICU patients, suggesting potential utility as a complementary prognostic tool. Further validation is warranted before clinical implementation."
41460586,Neutrophil extracellular traps associated with severity and prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia.,2025,"This study aimed to verify whether neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was related to the severity of respiratory tract infections (RTI) and establish a prognostic model for severe respiratory infections. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from RTI patients for RNA sequencing. Weighted Graph Co-expression Network Analysis was performed to identify gene modules and analyze the correlation between gene modules and clinical features. The prognostic model was established by LASSO regression. The concentration of IL-8 in plasma was measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gene expression levels in PBMC were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In total, 120 patients with RTIs were enrolled between July 2022 and March 2024. Enrichment analysis showed that NETs formation was enhanced during the early stages of pneumonia and sepsis. IL-8 had the strongest correlation with NETs formation, and the concentration of IL-8 in the plasma of patients with sepsis was significantly higher than that in patients with pneumonia and healthy controls (p < 0.001). NET-related genes were positively correlated with the SOFA score and 7-category ordinal scale. The expression level of MPO and PADI4 in sepsis patients were higher than that in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) alone and healthy controls. The AUC of the prognostic prediction model for severe CAP composed of two genes (PADI4-CD177) showed the best performance, with an AUC of 0.917. This study confirmed that NETs formation was activated in RTI and the 2-gene signature provided a rapid and highly accurate biomarker for predicting the prognosis of severe CAP, which awaits further verification in a prospective cohort."
41460289,SIRT2 Regulates Ex Vivo PBMC Adhesion in Septic Shock Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is deadly. Sepsis-immune response transitions from an endotoxin-sensitive, hyper-inflammatory phase to an endotoxin-tolerant hypo-inflammatory phase. In mice, we implicated sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) for prolonged hypo-inflammation using leukocyte adhesion, the earliest in vivo inflammatory response to cytokine, chemokine, and metabolite stimuli. The role of SIRT2 in human sepsis remains unknown. We hypothesized that: 1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) adhesion response can be used as a physiological biomarker of hypo-inflammation, and 2. SIRT2 regulates the functions of PBMCs and macrophages during the hypo-inflammatory phase of human sepsis. METHODS: We stimulated control and SS-whole blood and PBMCs +/- lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and investigated plasma cytokines, PBMC cell adhesion to ICAM-1 coated plates, adhesion molecule CD18 activation, SIRT2 expression, and cytokine response. In adhesion/endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and THP-1 cells treated +/- SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7, we analyzed cell adhesion, CD18 activation, and transmigration +/- LPS. In monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from SS vs. controls +/- AK-7, we analyzed phagocytosis. RESULTS: We found: 1. Muted plasma TNF and IL-1beta-response to LPS in SS vs. control (endotoxin-tolerance) 2. Endotoxin-tolerant SS-PBMCs exhibit high SIRT2 expression, and muted adhesion (adhesion-tolerance), CD18 activation, and transmigration with LPS. 3. SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 reverses endotoxin and adhesion-tolerance in SS-PBMCs via CD18 activation, reverses the defective transmigration of endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and improves phagocytosis in MDMs from SS patients. CONCLUSION: PBMC adhesion, a physiological biomarker, can be used to detect hypo-inflammation. Defective PBMC and macrophage function in septic shock patients occur via high SIRT2 expression. SIRT2 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating sepsis-associated hypo-inflammation."
41458497,Lactate and procalcitonin combined with qSOFA score for the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in ICU patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and early prognostic assessment is essential for improving outcomes. Although the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is widely used for bedside risk stratification, its standalone predictive performance is limited. Integrating biochemical markers such as lactate and procalcitonin (PCT) may improve prognostic accuracy. This study was designed to evaluate the combined value of qSOFA, lactate, and PCT in assessing disease severity and mortality risk, and to clarify the prognostic utility of dynamic monitoring at multiple time points. METHODS: This retrospective study included 128 ICU patients with sepsis, categorized into qSOFA < 2 (n = 57) and qSOFA >/= 2 (n = 71) groups. Lactate and PCT levels were recorded at ICU admission (T0), 24 h (T24), and 72 h (T72). ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and multiple organ failure rates were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with adjustment for age, hypertension, and SOFA score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive performance of qSOFA alone and in combination with the biomarkers. RESULTS: Patients with qSOFA >/= 2 had significantly higher ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05) and exhibited consistently elevated lactate and PCT levels at all three time points (P < 0.01). qSOFA, lactate, and PCT were independent predictors of both ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05). The combined model demonstrated superior discrimination, with AUCs of 0.79 for ICU mortality and 0.81 for 28-day mortality, outperforming qSOFA alone or qSOFA paired with a single biomarker. CONCLUSION: A qSOFA score >/= 2 identifies patients at higher risk of mortality. Dynamic monitoring of lactate and PCT significantly enhances early prognostic evaluation, and their combined use with qSOFA provides improved risk stratification for ICU patients with sepsis."
41458356,"Comprehensive Review of Sepsis-Related Skeletal Muscle Atrophy: Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Therapeutic Strategies.",2025,"This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current evidence on sepsis-related skeletal muscle atrophy, with a focus on underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic interventions. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to October 2024, including clinical, translational, and animal studies. We critically analyzed the pathophysiological mechanisms linking sepsis to muscle wasting, including inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteolytic pathways. Epidemiological data indicate a high incidence of muscle atrophy in sepsis patients, particularly among the elderly and those with comorbidities. Diagnostic modalities such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, and emerging biomarkers including urinary titin and myokines are discussed. Treatment strategies encompassing nutritional support, pharmacotherapy (eg, GLP-1RAs, myostatin inhibitors), and rehabilitation are evaluated. Controversies regarding etiology and treatment efficacy are highlighted. Future directions include the exploration of novel biomarkers, genomics-based personalized therapy, and long-term outcome studies. This review provides a structured and critical appraisal of the current state of knowledge, aiming to inform clinical practice and future research."
41457758,Revolutionizing non-traumatic acute care: review of the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in triaging and diagnosis.,2025,"Acute care settings, including emergency medicine and intensive care units, comprise a substantial portion of healthcare and are essential in the prompt management of conditions that can prove fatal. Critical care conditions require timely management that can be delayed by high patient volumes and the need for complex clinical decision making. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been created to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflow to improve patient care. This narrative review discusses the current status of AI in acute care, with a focus on its applications in triaging and diagnosis. AI-enhanced electrocardiogram analysis, identification of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure risk stratification led to better patient-specific management and improved results. AI models successfully determined and aided in the timely management of various acute conditions, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The AI algorithms used accurately determined sepsis onset and course, superseding traditionally used clinical tools and leading to early diagnosis and reduced sepsis mortality. These models showed high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing and triaging neurological conditions, including altered levels of consciousness, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhages. AI that involved advanced machine learning imaging software led to faster and more accurate stroke diagnosis. Diagnostic tools assisted by AI improved the detection and classification of acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. AI has shown promising results in optimizing management in acute care settings. However, critical issues in data standardization, ethical considerations, and clinical workflow integration need to be addressed to enable clinical implementation."
41457045,A new proposed approach to categorize sepsis sub-phenotypes based on combined trajectories of perfusion index and central venous oxygen saturation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Circulatory disturbances in sepsis are heterogeneous but often present clinically as a mismatch between peripheral perfusion and tissue oxygenation. Peripheral perfusion index (PI) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) have been independently validated as prognostic markers in sepsis; however, their combined utility has not been systematically explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2021. A novel index, PISO = (PI - 1.1) x ScvO(2), was calculated every 6 hours during the first 72 hours following sepsis onset. Dynamic time warping and hierarchical agglomerative clustering were applied to the 72-hour PISO trajectories to identify sub-phenotypes, with internal validation and sensitivity analysis. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the sub-phenotypes based on early clinical features. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, with particular focus on the association between 12-hour cumulative fluid balance and 28-day in-hospital survival. RESULTS: Among 12,975 patients, 5,205 (40.1%) developed sepsis. Of these, 720 patients with complete 6-hourly PI and ScvO(2) data were included. Three distinct PISO sub-phenotypes were identified. Phenotype 3, (n = 190, 33.0%), characterized by a persistently declining trajectory from a negative baseline, was associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. The random forest classifier demonstrated best performance and identified key early clinical features that differentiated each sub-phenotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a 12-hour cumulative fluid balance of </=0 mL was significantly associated with improved 28-day survival in Phenotype 1 (p = 0.038) and Phenotype 2 (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A persistently negative and declining PISO index within the first 72 hours of sepsis onset identifies a potential-risk sub-phenotype associated with adverse outcomes. Additionally, a non-positive 12-hour cumulative fluid balance post-sepsis onset is associated with improved survival in select phenotypic subgroups."
41456741,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy: Unraveling molecular mechanisms, emerging therapeutics, and translational frontiers.",2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a debilitating complication of systemic infection, marked by acute cognitive impairment and long-term neurological deficits in the absence of direct central nervous system (CNS) infection. Its pathogenesis involves a multifactorial interplay of neuroinflammation (e.g., cytokine storms), immune dysregulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, metabolic derangements, and impaired neuronal repair. These mechanisms synergistically contribute to neuronal injury and persistent cognitive dysfunction. Emerging therapeutic strategies-such as targeted immunomodulators, BBB-stabilizing agents, and novel CNS-targeted drug delivery-aim to interrupt this cascade and improve outcomes. Concurrently, precision medicine approaches leverage molecular profiling to tailor interventions. However, current clinical management remains supportive, hindered by incomplete mechanistic understanding and a paucity of disease-modifying therapies. This review synthesizes recent advances in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy, critically evaluates these mechanism-based therapeutic approaches, and highlights translational roadblocks in biomarker development and preclinical-to-clinical bridging. We also propose future directions to accelerate the development of targeted pharmacotherapies and personalized treatment paradigms for sepsis-associated encephalopathy."
41456737,Endothelial Glycocalyx biomarkers in acute lung injury.,2026,"Endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation contributes to vascular and pulmonary dysfunction in acute lung injury (ALI). This study provides a comprehensive review of the structure of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) and the mechanisms underlying its injury. Additionally, it evaluates biomarkers indicative of glycocalyx disruption that have been investigated for clinical use, including syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronan. These biomarkers have been studied in both circulating and airway compartments, with some studies reporting signal size-dependent variations in their levels. Laboratory measurement methods, specifically immunoassays and mass spectrometry, are examined with an emphasis on preanalytical variables, analytical performance, interference, and existing deficiencies in standardization, calibration, and traceability. These deficiencies contribute to the challenges in achieving comparability across different studies. Subsequently, we assessed the evidence regarding the clinical utility of risk stratification and outcome prediction in the context of ALI/ARDS and sepsis heterogeneity, focusing on cohort characteristics, sampling intervals, and sample types. In conclusion, we propose the implementation of novel glycocalyx-stabilizing treatments and future advancements, such as multi-marker panels and their integration with microvascular imaging. Generally, the standardization of protocols and establishment of reporting systems are essential prerequisites for the incorporation of these biomarkers into routine clinical laboratory and intensive care unit workflows as reliable tools."
41456572,Dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio for infection diagnosis and mortality risk stratification in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Two crucial needs persist in delivering effective critical care: reliable differentiation of infectious vs non-infectious systemic inflammation and detection of impending sepsis before the occurrence of organ dysfunction. This prospective cohort study evaluates the clinical utility of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) biomarker CD177/CD10 ratio to differentiate and monitor infections. METHODS: A total of 219 healthy volunteers and 145 patients were assigned to four clinically defined groups: healthy controls (HC), non-infectious inflammation (NI), non-septic infection (NS-I), and sepsis (S). Serial flow cytometric analysis of CD177 and CD10 expression in PMNs was conducted with longitudinal monitoring. Diagnostic efficacy was standardised against conventional biomarkers and organ dysfunction indices. A dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system (rising/declining/stable pattern) was established for prognostic stratification. FINDINGS: The CD177/CD10 ratio exhibited superior diagnostic performance in infection identification. At a cut-off point (CFP) of 6.07, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the ratio to differentiate NS-I from S was 0.92, exceeding those of CRP (0.85) and PCT (0.85). Notably, this biomarker effectively differentiated NI (CFP = 0.67, AUC = 0.79) from NS-I (CFP = 0.98, AUC = 0.71). The dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system showed robust prognostic efficacy: patients with the rising subtype exhibited a 7-day mortality rate of 62.5%, while those with decreasing and stable subtypes demonstrated survival rates of 85% and 92.59%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The CD177/CD10 ratio can facilitate infection-specific differentiation and real-time therapeutic monitoring by quantifying the dynamic equilibrium between the extent of neutrophil activation and maturation. However, the CD177/CD10 ratio still requires validation through a multi-centre trial to confirm the generalisability of the established diagnostic and prognostic thresholds.

41451084,Early prediction of ARDS caused by non-pulmonary sepsis based on machine learning algorithms of inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. Early identification and prediction of the occurrence of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis patients are of vital importance for timely intervention and improving the prognosis of these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 482 patients were included in this study. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method was employed to identify the key variables related to the prognosis of sepsis. The selected variables were used to construct nine different machine learning prediction models. To evaluate the performance of the model, we employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, calibration curve, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). The clinical significance of the model was further analyzed through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis. RESULTS: Through the RFE method, the final selected 11 variables. In the training set and test set, the AUC of the LightGBM model was 0.954 (95% CI: 0.933-0.973) and 0.923 (95% CI: 0.864-0.967) respectively. In this study, the calibration curve of the LightGBM model was close to the diagonal, indicating that its probability predictions were relatively reliable. In the DCA curves, the LightGBM model consistently maintained the highest net gain within the threshold range of 0-0.4, indicating LightGBM has greater clinical practical value. Through SHAP analysis, it was found that the SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, lactate level, creatinine, and SAPS II score were the five most important features in the model prediction. CONCLUSION: In this study, a machine learning model based on inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters was successfully developed and validated to predict the risk of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis."
41448497,Causal models and network instability in neurological and psychiatric disorders: Computational and clinical perspectives.,2026,"Self-diagnosis-the capacity of a system to detect and correct its own failures-is a defining property of adaptive systems. In the brain, recursive self-monitoring underlies perception, action, and cognition, but it is also fragile: small imbalances between priors and prediction errors can destabilize entire networks. Similar recursive instabilities are observed in immune collapse during sepsis and in failure modes of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we advance a unified framework of causal models and network instability, integrating predictive coding, computational psychiatry, network neuroscience, immunology, and AI. We analyze Parkinson's disease and sepsis as full case studies, and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as psychiatric parallels. Across these conditions, recursive failures manifest as rigid priors, amplified errors, or oscillatory attractors. Across neurological, psychiatric, and immune systems, recursive instability emerges when imbalances between prior precision and prediction-error precision destabilize feedback loops, leading to rigid, noise-amplified, or oscillatory dynamics. By framing Parkinson's disease, sepsis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder within a shared instability space, the proposed framework links predictive coding with network-level dynamics across biological domains. Clinically, this perspective motivates the development of state-dependent biomarkers and closed-loop interventions-such as adaptive neuromodulation and bioelectronic control-designed to stabilize recursive feedback rather than relying on static, open-loop therapies. Recognizing recursive instability as a transdiagnostic principle highlights shared vulnerabilities across brains, immune systems, and artificial agents, and points toward AI-augmented, causal, and adaptive interventions that integrate computational insight with clinical practice."
41446870,From Defense to Dysfunction: Decoding the Paradox of Emergency Granulopoiesis in Sepsis Pathogenesis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host response that culminates in organ dysfunction. Recognizing that many prior reviews treated neutrophils as largely homogeneous or discussed their functions in isolation, we present a framework centered on emergency granulopoiesis that unifies groundbreaking single-cell multi-omics discoveries, bone marrow niche remodeling, and bedside biomarkers such as the immature-to-total neutrophil ratio and sepsis endotypes to explain the shift from defense to dysfunction. As a hallmark adaptation, emergency granulopoiesis rapidly replenishes neutrophils but paradoxically yields immature neutrophils with impaired chemotaxis, excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis)/reactive oxygen species, and immunosuppressive activity that aggravate tissue damage, organ failure, and late immunoparalysis. We synthesize subset-level diversity and map this diversity to transcriptional shifts coupled with epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming as well as stromal inflammation. Clinically, elevated immature-to-total neutrophil ratios and these immature subsets align with disease severity and mortality, supporting biomarker-guided stratification. Stage-specific therapeutic strategies are evaluated along the continuum of emergency granulopoiesis, calibrating NETosis, and modulating metabolic reprogramming and epigenetics to restore neutrophil homeostasis. Furthermore, we delineate testable priorities for future research such as standardizing immature neutrophil phenotyping across cohorts and defining harmonized immature-to-total neutrophil ratio thresholds. By explicitly centering emergency granulopoiesis and integrating single-cell biology with bedside indicators, this review clarifies why a protective program becomes maladaptive in sepsis and outlines practical avenues for targeted interventions and trial design."

41445732,SHKBP1 is a target for sepsis: evidence from WGCNA and multiple machine learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Identifying novel biomarkers for sepsis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Cuproptosis, a recently discovered form of cell death associated with various diseases, has an unclear relationship with sepsis. This study aimed to elucidate the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes(CRGs) in sepsis, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We investigated the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes in sepsis and performed consensus clustering. A diagnostic model for sepsis was constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combined with four machine learning algorithms. Prognosis-related genes were identified via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and validated in septic mice. RESULTS: We identified 28 differentially expressed CRGs and characterized a specific immune landscape. Our findings showed that sepsis samples could be divided into two clusters based on CRGs expression. We established a diagnostic model based on five key genes(SHKBP1,ICAM2,CTSD,SNX3, and SLC22A4), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that SHKBP1 was significantly correlated with both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of CRGs expression in sepsis, establishes a diagnostic model, and identifies SHKBP1 as a biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis prediction, offering new insights for sepsis management."
41444533,Identification of potential characteristic genes in sepsis utilizing RNA sequencing and gene silence.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a serious condition involving organ dysfunction that can be life-threatening, posing a significant threat to human health. The mortality rate associated with sepsis ranges from 10% to 40%, with severe cases or those involving septic shock exhibiting mortality rates exceeding 50%. OBJECTIVE: Gene sequencing took place on the blood samples that were collected both healthy volunteers and septic patients in this study. Advanced methodologies, including bioinformatics analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), meta-analysis, and single-cell localization analysis, were employed to identify potential biomarkers associated with the immunomodulation of sepsis. The identified molecular markers were further validated through the establishment of a sepsis cell model, gene silence techniques, and an ELISA test experiments to assess inflammatory factors. METHODS: In this study, 23 individuals with sepsis and 10 healthy volunteers as controls, and peripheral blood samples were collected. The blood specimens were processed with the assistance of BGI for comprehensive gene sequencing. Post-sequencing, the data underwent quality control measures and were subsequently analyzed using the online platform iDEP 2.01 ( http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/ ) to identify differentially expressed genes. Conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses on the identified differentially expressed genes.To elucidate core genes from multiple perspectives, a PPI network was created with the help of the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/),facilitatin g the examination of gene interactions in terms of protein. Following the recognition of core genes, sepsis-associated data sets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database. Specifically, the transcriptional expression of the gene S100A11 was analyzed using meta-analysis techniques, and its survival curve was subsequently evaluated.The S100A11 gene, identified through screening, was analyzed using an online visualization system to determine its single-cell localization. Initial findings indicated that the gene is predominantly expressed in macrophages. (THP-1 cells) are known as a human monocytic cell line utilized in studies.We cultured THP-1 cells and differentiated into macrophages, followed by stimulation and transfection with the S100A11 gene. The interference effect of S100A11 was assessed using quantitative fluorescence PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, THP-1 cells were cultured to establish a septic cell model, and S100A11 gene silence experiments were conducted, categorizing the samples into control, sepsis, and gene silence sepsis groups. ELISA was employed to assess the concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that S100A11 is highly expressed in sepsis and is primarily localized in macrophages. The enrichment in signaling pathways, including Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, was uncovered by differential gene expression analysis.S100A11 serves as a critical regulatory node for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Notably, S100A11 was found to be highly expressed in patients with sepsis. This gene plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation during the septic inflammatory response and may be involved in macrophage differentiation, immunomodulation, and the inflammatory processes associated with sepsis."
41443201,Diagnostic Utility of Combined Serum Procalcitonin and C-Reactive Proteins in Neonatal Sepsis.,2025,"Aims/Background Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is hindered by nonspecific clinical signs and suboptimal biomarkers. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), both individually and in combination, and assess the robustness and clinical utility of a combined predictive model. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort (2022-2025, Longyan First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, China) included 293 neonates (161 with sepsis and 132 controls). Univariate logistic regression was applied to compare the clinical and laboratory parameters between the sepsis and control groups. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, contingency tables, and the DeLong tests. A logistic regression-based combined prediction model was developed using a 7:3 stratified random split into training and validation sets. Model robustness was assessed via calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and visualized as a nomogram. Subgroup and culture-confirmed-only sensitivity analyses further assessed the consistency of the combined predictive model. Results Sepsis cases exhibited significantly higher PCT, CRP, and white blood cell (WBC), and lower hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) (all p < 0.001). Univariate logistic regression confirmed PCT [odds ratio (OR) = 3.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.23-4.93, p < 0.001] and CRP (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.003) as significant predictors of neonatal sepsis. The combined PCT-CRP model provided better diagnostic performance, achieving a significantly greater area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) than either marker alone (0.88 for PCT, 0.87 for CRP) as shown by DeLong test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the model maintained higher sensitivity (82.61%) while significantly improving specificity (93.18%) and overall diagnostic accuracy (87.36%). The nomogram, validated in both sets, exhibited good calibration and net clinical benefit in DCA. Subgroup analysis confirmed consistent predictive performance across gestational age, delivery mode, and sex, with CRP more pronounced in preterm infants. Sensitivity analyses using culture-confirmed sepsis validated model robustness (AUC = 0.94). Conclusion PCT and CRP are key diagnostic biomarkers for neonatal sepsis. Their integration as a combined predictive model significantly enhances diagnostic performance and clinical applicability, providing a practical framework for early sepsis identification and potential for clinical implementation."
41439929,Sepsis and the Liver.,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a critical and often early complication of sepsis, defined by distinct hyper-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases that shape patient phenotypes. METHODS: Characterizing these phases establishes a foundation for immunomodulation strategies tailored to individual immune responses, as discussed subsequently. RESULTS: The initial inflammatory response activates pathways such as NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to a cytokine storm that damages hepatocytes and is frequently associated with higher SOFA scores and a higher risk of 28-day mortality. Kupffer cells and infiltrating neutrophils exacerbate hepatic injury by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, thereby causing cellular damage and prolonging ICU stays. During the subsequent immunosuppressive phase, impaired infection control and tissue repair can result in recurrent hospital-acquired infections and a poorer prognosis. Concurrently, hepatocytes undergo significant metabolic disturbances, notably impaired fatty acid oxidation due to downregulation of transcription factors such as PPARalpha and HNF4alpha. This metabolic alteration corresponds with worsening liver function tests, which may reflect the severity of liver failure in clinical practice. Mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by oxidative stress and defective autophagic quality control, impairs cellular energy production and induces hepatocyte death, which is closely linked to declining liver function and increased mortality. The gut-liver axis plays a central role in SALI pathogenesis, as sepsis-induced gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability allow bacterial products, including lipopolysaccharides, to enter the portal circulation and further inflame the liver. This process is associated with sepsis-related liver failure and greater reliance on vasopressor support. Protective microbial metabolites, such as indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), decrease significantly during sepsis, removing key anti-inflammatory signals and potentially prolonging recovery. Clinically, SALI most commonly presents as septic cholestasis with elevated bilirubin and mild transaminase changes, although conventional liver function tests are insufficiently sensitive for early detection. Novel biomarkers, including protein panels and non-coding RNAs, as well as dynamic liver function tests such as LiMAx (currently in phase II diagnostics) and ICG-PDR, offer promise for improved diagnosis and prognostication. Specifying the developmental stage of these biomarkers, such as identifying LiMAx as phase II, informs investment priorities and translational readiness. Current management is primarily supportive, emphasizing infection control and organ support. Investigational therapies include immunomodulation tailored to immune phenotypes, metabolic and mitochondrial-targeted agents such as pemafibrate and dichloroacetate, and interventions to restore gut microbiota balance, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, translational challenges remain due to limitations of animal models and patient heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Future research should focus on developing representative models, validating biomarkers, and conducting clinical trials to enable personalized therapies that modulate inflammation, restore metabolism, and repair the gut-liver axis, with the goal of improving outcomes in SALI."
41439926,Circulating Interleukin-6 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Mortality in Melioidosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Background: Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, remains a major cause of sepsis-related mortality in tropical regions. Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, deaths frequently result from dysregulated host inflammation rather than uncontrolled bacterial replication. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key mediator of systemic inflammation, has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis, but its predictive value in melioidosis has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO CRD420251152797). MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to 15 March 2025. Eligible studies included patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis reporting circulating IL-6 concentrations stratified by survival outcome. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. Heterogeneity and robustness were examined through leave-one-out and sensitivity analyses. Publication bias assessment was not performed due to insufficient study numbers (n = 4). Results: Eight studies were included qualitative systematic review, and four studies comprising 411 patients were eligible for quantitative meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly higher IL-6 levels among non-survivors compared with survivors (SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.02-1.57; I(2) = 86.3%). Leave-one-out diagnostics indicated no single study unduly influenced the pooled effect. Sensitivity analysis excluding the largest dataset reduced heterogeneity to 34.5% and yielded an SMD of 0.51 (95% CI -0.28-1.30), maintaining the same direction of association. Conclusions: Circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in fatal melioidosis and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for mortality. Although interstudy heterogeneity was substantial, the association remained consistent in direction across populations and analytical methods despite the limited number of eligible studies. These findings support further prospective validation of IL-6 in clinical risk stratification and host response-guided management of severe melioidosis, though larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."
41438687,Updates on the role of miR-193b in the pathogenesis of human cancers and other diseases.,2026,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, fundamentally influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Among these, miR-193b has garnered significant attention as a potent tumor suppressor in some contexts, while functioning as an oncogene in other situations. Its frequent loss in some types of cancers such as gastric and cervical cancers as well as osteosarcoma positions it not only as a valuable prognostic indicator but also as a potential tool for gene therapy. On the other hand, it has been found to be up-regulated in esophageal and bladder cancers. Meanwhile, data regarding its expression pattern in some types of cancers, such as colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers is conflicting. Moreover, its influence extends beyond oncology, implicating it in a diverse range of human diseases, including systemic sclerosis, aortic dissection, osteoarthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis and allergic rhinitis. However, miR-193b does not have a single, unified function; instead, its role is highly context-dependent, acting as either a protective molecule or a pathogenic driver depending on the specific tissue and disease. This review aims to consolidate the current updates on the role of miR-193b, detailing its molecular mechanisms, validated target genes, and its burgeoning potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in cancer and other pathological conditions."
41438024,Prognostic value of the pan-immune-inflammation value for mortality in sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Its associated coagulopathy, known as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), significantly increases mortality risk. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), a composite biomarker reflecting systemic immune and inflammatory status, has been linked to prognosis in various diseases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of PIV in patients with SIC and to develop predictive models accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database and included 4554 patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patients were stratified into high- and low-PIV groups based on the median PIV, and clinical characteristics were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were employed to assess the association between PIV and patient outcomes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to identify key variables for constructing a nomogram model. Additionally, machine learning algorithms, including random forest, were applied to build and validate predictive models. RESULTS: Patients in the high-PIV group had significantly higher 30-day and 90-day mortality rates. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with lower PIVs had markedly better survival, and a nonlinear positive correlation was observed between PIV and mortality risk. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression identified 8 key variables, including Acute Physiology Score III, lactate, red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, acute kidney injury, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The nomogram based on these variables achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Among machine learning models, the random forest algorithm exhibited the best predictive performance, with areas under the curve of 0.837 and 0.947 in the training and validation sets, respectively. External validation using a real-world cohort from Xingtai People's Hospital further confirmed the association between elevated PIV and increased mortality and SIC, with consistent survival trends and nonlinear patterns observed in both Kaplan-Meier and restricted cubic spline analyses. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate PIV into the prognostic assessment of patients with SIC. The development of a visual nomogram and machine learning-based models provides clinicians with practical tools for early identification of patients at high risk for SIC, potentially aiding in the optimization of treatment strategies."
41437592,[Advances in the study of de-resuscitation in septic shock].,2025,"The initial management of septic shock necessitates adequate fluid resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion. However, excessive or sustained fluid administration may precipitate fluid accumulation syndrome (FAS), significantly exacerbating the risk of organ dysfunction and mortality. Consequently, proactive prevention and management of FAS are paramount for optimizing patient outcomes. With the continuous optimization of fluid resuscitation strategies in the treatment of septic shock, de-resuscitation, as a key stage for preventing or correcting FAS, provides an important opportunity to improve patient prognosis. Recent studies have shown that during the later phase of septic shock resuscitation, active de-resuscitation combined with hemodynamic monitoring, adjustment of vasoactive drugs and other comprehensive intervention measures can help reduce fluid positive balance, lower the risk of organ dysfunction, shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and improve patient prognosis. Currently, the timing of de-resuscitation, volume assessment methods, the development of individualized treatment protocols, and the prevention and control of related complications have become the focus of research, while the search for reliable biomarkers to guide de-resuscitation strategies will become a future hot direction. In this article, we review the pathophysiology and clinical diagnosis of FAS, as well as the clinical strategies, controversies and challenges of de-resuscitation in septic shock, and explore the future research directions of de-resuscitation strategies, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and practical guidance for optimizing fluid management in patients with septic shock."
41436719,Acute kidney injury prediction and prognostication using machine learning.,2025,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a major health concern with high costs and poor outcomes, partly due to late diagnosis. This paper reviews the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to overcome these limitations by enabling earlier and more accurate prediction and prognostication of AKI. Many studies on AI and ML models used to predict and prognosticate AKI were included in the review. The focus was on models that analyze complex datasets, including real-time data streams like novel biomarkers and continuous vital signs, to achieve earlier and more accurate predictions than conventional methods. ML models show high predictive accuracy for AKI onset and outcomes across various clinical settings, including intensive care units, sepsis, and postoperative and postcontrast situations, with key findings like the successful integration of real-time data to reflect the evolving nature of kidney injury. AI and ML offer a powerful, proactive solution for AKI management. By leveraging diverse data, these technologies can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. While their promising performance warrants further exploration, successful clinical integration will require user-friendly platforms and continued validation."
41436269,Evaluation of the performance and safety of adding the iron chelator MEX-CD1 to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis for removing excess labile iron in intensive care patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury - the Iron in Intensive Care trial (IRON-I.C.): protocol for a phase I-II randomised crossover pilot study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is common in intensive care and is linked to high morbidity and mortality, yet no specific therapy exists beyond supportive care. Excess circulating labile iron contributes to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death via ferroptosis. We hypothesise that targeted removal of labile iron during dialysis may reduce this pathogenic process. This study will evaluate the performance and safety of adding a novel iron chelator named MEX-CD1 (Metal EXtraction - Chitosan DOTAGA 1) to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised, open-label, crossover phase I-II pilot study in the intensive care unit of Nimes University Hospital, France. 14 adult patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy will receive two consecutive 24-hour CVVHD sessions: one with standard dialysate and one with dialysate supplemented with MEX-CD1 at 50 mg/L. Each patient serves as their own control. The primary outcome is the iron concentration in the effluent to measure iron removal performance. Secondary outcomes include plasma iron clearance, trace element loss, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and safety outcomes monitored up to 28 days. Statistical analyses will use paired tests and mixed linear regression models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Comite de Protection des Personnes (no. 25.01220.000448) and the French National Agency for Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (no. 2024-A01530-47). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT07236463."
41433302,Lycopene inhibits ER stress and apoptosis while modulating PI3K/AKT and enhancing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic proteins.,2025,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical clinical syndrome with limited therapeutic options. This study investigated the renoprotective effects of lycopene, a potent antioxidant, in both in vivo and in vitro AKI models. In a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis-AKI model, pretreatment with lycopene (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated renal histopathological damage (HE staining) and restored serum biomarkers (AST, ALT, BUN, CREA). Mechanistically, lycopene suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/Akt axis: it significantly reversed the CLP-induced upregulating of p-PI3K and p-Akt, and the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3), while increasing Nrf 2 and SOD1. Consistent results were observed in LPS- and H(2)O(2)-induced cellular AKI models, where lycopene attenuated cell death and restored redox homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence assays further validated these trends. Crucially, PI3K siRNA or cDNA transfection experiments confirmed that lycopene's antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects were PI3K-dependent. Our findings highlight lycopene as a promising therapeutic agent for AKI, acting via PI3K/Akt-mediated activation of Nrf 2 to counteract oxidative damage and apoptosis. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lycopene's renoprotection and supports its potential clinical translation for sepsis or oxidative stress-associated AKI."
41432632,Histone H3 may be More Closely Associated with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation and Multiple Organ Failure Than HMGB1.,2025,"BackgroundAmong damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the specific contributions of histone and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between two DAMP markers, plasma histone H3 and HMGB1 levels, and concurrent DIC and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in critically ill patients.MethodsPlasma levels of histone H3 and HMGB1 were prospectively quantified in 46 critically ill patients who demonstrated systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possible sepsis, and required intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. We analyzed two DAMP marker values, various plasma-inflammatory and non-inflammatory cytokine levels, acute DIC on ICU day 3, and the maximum SOFA score at 48 h after ICU admission.ResultsOn ICU day 3, 25 patients had DIC while 21 did not. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma histone H3 levels (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.17 [1.02- 1.49], p = 0.008) and TNF-alpha (1.006 [1.001- 1.014], p = 0.007) were significant independent factors of DIC pathogenesis. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for the maximum SOFA score were 0.664, 0.602, 0.348, and 0.221 for IL-8, IL-6, histone H3, and HMGB1, respectively.ConclusionIn the early phase requiring intensive care, histone H3 levels exhibited a more positive association with the onset of DIC than HMGB1. Conversely, inflammatory cytokines may exert a more substantial influence on the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure in comparison to DAMPs."
41432366,Association of serum calcium levels within the first hour of ER admission with 28-day mortality in sepsis: A retrospective ICU analysis.,2025,"Sepsis poses a global health challenge, necessitating effective predictors for risk stratification and timely intervention. Serum calcium, involved in vital physiological processes, has shown potential associations with sepsis outcomes, but the evidence remains limited and conflicting. This retrospective study included 1000 sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Serum calcium levels were measured within 1 hour of emergency room (ER) admission. Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and severity scores, were collected. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to assess the association between serum calcium levels and 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed the effect of serum calcium on 28-day survival. Lower serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission were significantly associated with higher 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.1097, 95% CI: 0.04024-0.2912, P < .0001), even after adjusting for confounders. The area under the curve for serum calcium in predicting 28-day mortality was 0.5885 (P < .0001). Combining serum calcium with other predictors, such as the Charlson comorbidity index, red cell distribution width, lactic acid levels, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, improved predictive accuracy (area under the curve: 0.7245, P < .0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant association between lower serum calcium levels and reduced 28-day survival (P < .0001). Low serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission are significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. It complements existing predictors, showcasing its potential role in a comprehensive prognostic framework."
41430733,Systematic review and meta-analysis of humoral immunity proteins and mortality in sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Humoral immunity proteins-immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides-have key antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions in sepsis. We hypothesised that their circulating levels are lower in non-survivors, potentially resulting in impaired bacterial clearance and persistent or recurrent infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating differences in humoral immunity proteins between survivors and non-survivors in adult patients with sepsis. PubMed and Embase were searched without date restrictions. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analyses included data from the MIMIC-IV ICU database, and further supplemented by three proteomic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies including 6,330 patients were analysed. Thirteen reported on immunoglobulins, 17 on complement proteins, and 7 on the antimicrobial peptide heparin-binding protein (HBP). Survivors had significantly higher levels of complement proteins C3 (SMD 0.53 [0.07-0.99]) and C4 (SMD 0.51 [0.09-0.94]) compared to non-survivors. Conversely, C4a (SMD - 1.17 [-1.77 to - 0.56]) and IgA (SMD - 0.21 [-0.39 to - 0.03]) were significantly lower in survivors. No differences were found for IgG (SMD 0.00 [-0.18 to 0.18]), IgM (SMD - 0.02 [-0.13 to 0.08]), C5, C5a, or HBP. Sensitivity analyses using MIMIC-IV (n = 2,452) and proteomic datasets supported these findings. Proteomic data revealed early depletion of classical complement components (C3, C4B) and regulatory proteins in non-survivors. CONCLUSION: Sepsis non-survivors exhibit lower C3 and C4 levels and higher C4a, consistent with complement activation and/or depletion. Complement proteins may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in sepsis."
41430129,Risk stratification for CMV reactivation in sepsis patients: development of an interpretable machine learning model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in critically ill populations is associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model to predict CMV reactivation within 28 days of ICU admission in sepsis patients, providing a risk stratification tool to optimize clinical management. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from intensive care unit (ICU) patients meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria. Key clinical variables, including acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ(APACHE Ⅱscore), CMV IgG titer, CD4(+) lymphocyte count, and corticosteroid use duration, were selected through univariate logistic regression. Seven machine learning models were developed, with the gradient boosting machine (GBM) demonstrating superior performance. Model interpretability was enhanced using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to identify critical predictors and visualize feature contributions. RESULTS: Among 221 patients, 19.0% experienced CMV reactivation. The test set AUC values for GBM, logistic regression (LR), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were recorded as 0.761, 0.684, 0.673, 0.659, 0.65, 0.624, and 0.623, respectively. GBM model achieved the highest AUC in the test set, with robust calibration and net benefit of the GBM model in the test set exceeded that of the other models at threshold probabilities ranging from 10% to 60%. SHAP analysis identified the APACHE II score, corticosteroid use, CMV IgG levels, and CD4 + lymphocyte count as the top four important predictors. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated significant stratification between high- and low-risk groups (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This interpretable machine learning model provides accurate CMV reactivation prediction and clear insights into contributing factors. It has the potential to enhance early risk stratification and guide targeted management strategies for sepsis patients in ICU settings.

41429071,C-reactive protein in adult sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases, without language or time restrictions. Studies involving adults at risk for, suspected of, or diagnosed with sepsis who underwent CRP measurement and reported diagnostic or prognostic accuracy data were eligible. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies were included. Risk of bias was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 tool, and the quality of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: A total of 3599 records were screened, and 22 studies (13,083 patients) met the inclusion criteria, 16 assessing diagnostic accuracy and 6 evaluating prognostic value. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity was 83 % (95 % CI 75 %-89 %) and specificity was 56 % (95 % CI 41 %-69 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 80.1 %) and a false-positive rate of 44.3 % (95 % CI 30.9 %‒58.6 %). In the prognostic analysis for mortality, the pooled sensitivity was 81 % (95 % CI 70 %-89 %) and the specificity was 77 % (95 % CI 64 %-86 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 65.9 %) and a false-positive rate of 22.8 % (95 % CI 13.6 %-35.6 %). Most studies presented a moderate to high risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence reveals high diagnostic uncertainty and limited prognostic accuracy of CRP in adults with sepsis. The low specificity and high error rates restrict the clinical utility of CRP for diagnostic or prognostic decision-making in sepsis management."
41427863,PANCREATIC STONE PROTEIN (PSP) AS AN EARLY PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKER OF OUTCOME IN CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a major healthcare-associated infection, leading to severe complications. Early identification of patients at high risk for unfavorable outcome remains challenging. Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) has emerged as a promising biomarker in sepsis; however, its role in CDI has not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of adult patients with CDI from 13 hospitals in Greece. PSP was measured within 24 hours of CDI onset. Primary outcome was the association between PSP and unfavorable outcome, defined as at least one of the following: organ failure, severe disease progression, relapse, or death. ROC curve was performed to assess diagnostic performance, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate independent predictors of adverse outcome. RESULTS: 147 patients were enrolled, and unfavorable outcome occurred in 52. PSP levels were significantly higher in these patients. PSP showed an AUC 0.648 (95% CI 0.550-0.746, p=0.003) for predicting adverse outcome and an optimal cut-off of 300 ng/mL, increased the risk significantly (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.822-7.638, p<0.001). C-reactive protein (CRP) was also associated with adverse outcome (AUC 0.619, 95% CI: 0.512-0.726, p: 0.03), with an optimal cut-off >/=90 mg/l. Combined elevation of PSP and CRP conferred stronger prognostic value (OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.78-17.85, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, PSP >/=300 ng/ml (p: 0.006) and CRP >/=90 mg/l (p:0.04) remained independently associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating PSP in CDI. PSP, especially combined with CRP, may serve as complementary biomarkers for early risk stratification."
41426991,Study on the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in neurocritical care patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common neurological complication in neurocritical care units, characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction without direct central nervous system infection. Early identification and prognosis assessment remain challenging due to the lack of specific diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of SAE in neurocritical care patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 200 neurocritical care patients with sepsis over a 2-year period. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed using sidestream dark field (SDF) videomicroscopy, measuring perfused vessel density (PVD), microvascular flow index (MFI), and perfused boundary region (PBR). Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring was performed for 72 h. Serum biomarkers including neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were measured at admission and serially. The primary outcome was the development of SAE, and secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and neurological function at 90 days. RESULTS: Among 200 patients, 134 (67%) developed SAE. Patients with SAE showed significantly reduced PVD (8.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 12.4 +/- 2.8 mm/mm(2), p < 0.001) and MFI (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001) compared to non-SAE patients. The combination of microcirculation parameters with EEG abnormalities yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) for predicting SAE. Early microcirculation-EEG patterns were strongly associated with 28-day mortality (HR: 3.45, 95% CI: 2.12-5.61, p < 0.001) and poor neurological outcomes at 90 days. CONCLUSION: The combination of early microcirculation perfusion indicators with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring provides excellent predictive value for SAE occurrence and prognosis in neurocritical care patients. This multimodal approach may facilitate early identification and risk stratification."
41426368,The utility of C-reactive protein in neonatal early-onset sepsis screening: A territory-wide cohort analysis.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a commonly used biomarker for sepsis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate CRP's diagnostic performance to detect neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), while accounting for both gestational and postnatal age. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of neonates born from January 2006 to December 2017 in public hospitals in Hong Kong. Neonates who had CRP tested within 72 h of birth, prior to antibiotics initiation, were included. CRP values were analyzed by gestational age and time after birth. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS: Among 100 327 tested neonates, 448 developed culture-confirmed EOS, and 34 had meningitis. In uninfected neonates, CRP concentrations rose naturally after 8 h of life, peaking at 24-32 h, with higher values in term neonates at 24-48 h (median 6.2 mg/L, interquartile range 2.9-14.3). Diagnostic performance was better in preterm neonates (e.g., the area under the ROC curve after 4 h of life: 0.88 in <34 weeks, 0.83-0.92 in 34-36 weeks, and 0.73-0.77 in term neonates). Sensitivity within the first 4 h was low across all groups. LRs increased with higher CRP values in preterm neonates. A CRP value of >12.0 mg/L was associated with increased risk of meningitis. INTERPRETATION: CRP is not recommended for EOS screening in term neonates, but it may be considered for assessing the risk of EOS in preterm neonates. Interpretation must account for gestational and postnatal age."
41425961,The non-linear association between creatinine-to-albumin ratio and medium-term mortality in patients with sepsis accompanied by acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database and external validation.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the Creatinine to Albumin Ratio (CAR) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database (v2.2) to analyze data from 2,712 adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and AKI. External validation was performed using a single-center cohort of 412 patients from Ningbo No. 2 Hospital (January 2022-December 2024). Patients were stratified into quartiles based on CAR values. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the consistency of CAR's prognostic utility across various patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Infection types were categorized based on ICD-9/10 codes into pulmonary, abdominal, urinary tract, bloodstream, and other infections. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were excluded to minimize confounding by pre-existing renal impairment. RESULTS: Among 2,712 included patients, those in the highest CAR quartile (Q4) had the lowest survival probability. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in mortality across quartiles (log-rank P<0.001). In fully adjusted Cox models that included newly incorporated metabolic and hemodynamic variables (electrolytes, lactate, and vasopressors use), both continuous CAR (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.16, P = 0.048; ICU mortality: HR = 1.18, P = 0.044) and Q4 (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.72, P<0.001; ICU mortality: HR = 1.61, P<0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality risk. RCS analysis revealed a J-shaped relationship with ICU mortality, with an inflection point at CAR = 1.2 mg/dL. External validation confirmed CAR's prognostic value for 30-day mortality, with consistent associations observed in the validation cohort (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.43, P = 0.032). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed strong early predictive accuracy (7-day AUC = 0.75). Subgroup analyses confirmed CAR's robust prognostic value, which remained consistent across different infection types and was particularly pronounced in older, obese, and mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: CAR is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in sepsis-associated AKI, with both continuous measurements and the highest quartile (Q4) demonstrating significant associations after comprehensive adjustment for metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. The identified threshold (CAR = 1.2 mg/dL) enhances its clinical utility. While CAR provides independent prognostic information, its modest effect sizes suggest it should be used as a complementary tool rather than a standalone predictor. CAR's simplicity and accessibility make it a valuable adjunct for risk stratification in this high-risk population."
41425931,Metabolomic analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae: uncovering key metabolic pathways.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal infection, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a prevalent cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a major pathogen responsible for illnesses such as meningitis, sepsis, and pharyngitis. The complex etiology of S. pneumoniae infection poses significant challenges in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. METHODS: In this study, twenty serum samples from individuals infected with S. pneumoniae and fifteen serum samples from normal controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify metabolites. Multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were used to identify potential metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was employed to map the metabolic pathways associated with these metabolites. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis of the metabolic profiles of infected individuals and normal controls, we identified 418 metabolites that significantly contributed to the differentiation of group samples. The identified metabolites were categorized into various groups, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, and were enriched in pathways including galactose metabolism, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, the citrate cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. S. pneumoniae infection induced significant variations in the serum metabolome, with activation of metabolic pathways implicated in the immune response. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive and real-time analysis of the metabolic network, elucidating the complex processes that occur following pathogen invasion in the human body. The identification of metabolic biomarkers and enriched pathways lays a foundational framework for research and offers visualizable targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumococcal infections."
41425588,Immunophenotyping of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy: focus on monocyte subtypes and Immune regulatory molecules.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is characterized by dysregulation of the host response to infection Q5 which results in life-threatening organ dysfunction that can be partly attributed to immune alterations and endothelial dysfunction (endotheliopathy). This lethal condition is dynamic, complex, and heterogeneous. AIM: Thus, an exploratory broad phenotypic and functional analysis of circulating immune cells and mediators were carried out to better understand the role of the immune system in a subgroup of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy defined by increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). In this regard, especially the immune status of monocyte subtypes (classical, intermediate, and nonclassical) was investigated for surface thrombomodulin (TM), MHC class II molecules (HLADR, -DQ, and -DP) and immunomodulatory surface receptors (TREM-1, CD137, VISTA, HVEM and BTLA). RESULT AND CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis on a septic shock cohort with endotheliopathy identified distinct immune perturbation patterns that potentially can lead to novel treatment avenues in the management of this life-threatening condition."
41424725,Bioinformatics-based identification and validation of mitochondria-related genes associated with neonatal sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: While mitochondrial involvement in sepsis has been widely studied, its role in neonatal sepsis (NESE) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) in NESE using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: This study utilized neonatal sepsis-related datasets GSE69686 and GSE95233. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing NESE and control groups. Subsequently, candidate genes were then selected by intersecting DEGs with MRGs. These candidate genes were further refined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm to identify potential biomarkers. Expression levels and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of the candidate biomarkers were assessed in both datasets. To further investigate their mechanisms, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction analyses were conducted. Finally, biomarker expression was validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 24 candidate genes were obtained by overlapping 579 DEGs and 1,136 MRGs. ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, MTHFD2, PDSS1, and TSPO were identified as biomarkers. The enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and TSPO in the lysosome compartment. Moreover, there were significant differences in seven immune cells (M0 macrophage, activated NK cell, neutrophil, etc) between NESE samples and normal samples. Importantly, the correlation analysis revealed that the expression of ACSL1 exhibited a negative correlation with CD8 + T cells, whereas it demonstrated a positive association with neutrophil. Additionally, it also found birch A and Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin simultaneously targeted TSPO, MTHFD2, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and ACSL1. Importantly, the RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the expression results of PDSS1, TSPO, and ALAS1 were consistent with the public database, showing significantly over-expressed in the NESE group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, six mitochondria-related biomarkers in NESE were identified and preliminarily validated, which may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and serve as a potential basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic exploration."
41422448,Search for novel biomarkers of febrile neutropenia in hematological patients: an overview.,2025,"A single-center prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kuopio Finland over the past two decades, searching for novel biomarker candidates to predict complicated course of febrile neutropenia (FN) in hematological patients. In Dec 2006‒Dec 2015, 85 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 179 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were included. More than 20 biomarkers were evaluated in subsequent patient cohorts and compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). The samples were taken on d0-d2 from the beginning of FN. Here, we provide an overview of the results of these studies. Most biomarkers evaluated did not provide additional prognostic benefit compared to CRP or PCT. The most promising biomarkers warranting further studies include soluble cluster of differentiation 14, interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18. Several biomarkers evaluated in this series of studies are hampered by impaired production by neutrophils/leukocytes (matrix metalloproteinase-8, cell-free plasma DNA and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) or platelets (vascular endothelial growth factor). For now, these novel biomarkers cannot substitute the conventional markers nor provide additional benefit in routine use. Optimally, the most promising novel markers should be evaluated in prospective multicenter studies with higher patient numbers and several endpoints to more reliably evaluate their performance. At present, close patient monitoring is imperative in hematological patients with FN. The additional information provided by novel FN biomarkers may be useful, but they should be evaluated combined with daily evaluation of sepsis scoring systems."
41422100,Machine learning-based prediction of mortality and multidrug-resistant infection risks in ICU patients with suspected infection: a prospective national multicenter cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Suspected infection can progress to sepsis or septic shock, contributing to a high mortality rate among patients admitted to ICU. However, the characteristics of suspected infection remain incompletely defined. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models to identify independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection in patients with suspected infection upon ICU admission in mainland China. METHODS: We prospectively collected medical data from patients with suspected infection admitted to ICUs across mainland China between July 2021 and December 2022. Patients were randomly allocated to a training cohort and a validation cohort at a 7:3 ratio. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified risk factors and constructed predictive models for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection. The performance of models developed by logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and gradient boosting machine was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), Brier score, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), the Youden index, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: A total of 2963 patients from 67 hospitals in mainland China were enrolled. The most common infection sites were the lung (79.28%), bloodstream (17.11%) and abdomen (16.54%). The overall mortality rate was 10.90%. The logistic regression model demonstrated the best performance for mortality prediction (AUC 0.87) and identified the following risk factors: surgery (2.39, 95CI% 1.60-3.56, p < 0.01), APACHE II score (1.51, 95CI% 1.44-1.58, p < 0.01), and bloodstream infection (2.08, 95CI% 1.40-3.10, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors of mortality. For multidrug resistant infection prediction, the logistic regression model also showed the highest discriminative ability (AUC 0.86). Independent risk factors included APACHE II score (1.06, 95%CI 1.03-1.1, p < 0.01), bloodstream infection (1.82, 95%CI 1.26-2.61, p < 0.01), urinary infection (3.42, 95%CI 2.20-5.30, p < 0.01), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.67, 95%CI 7.91-17.21, p < 0.01), Acinetobacter baumannii (85.22, 95%CI 50.03-145.18, p < 0.01), and Enterococcus faecium (22.10, 95%CI 8.58-56.93, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was the most common infection among ICU patients in mainland China. Using machine learning techniques, we developed and validated predictive models that identified independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection upon ICU admission.

41421980,Leveraging laboratory biomarkers to predict urosepsis after upper urinary tract stone surgery: an explainable machine learning approach.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Urosepsis is a leading cause of perioperative mortality after upper urinary tract stone surgery. This study aimed to develop a simple and accurate predictive model for postoperative sepsis by integrating laboratory parameters using machine learning (ML) and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm. METHODS: Data from 7,464 patients were analyzed, including 155 pre- and postoperative features. Key variables were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and correlation analysis. Eight ML algorithms were employed to develop the predictive model using 10-fold cross-validation. The model's performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. The SHAP algorithm was employed to analyze variable importance. Finally, the model was converted into a publicly accessible application. RESULTS: 116 out of 155 variables (74.84%) differed significantly between the urosepsis (n = 622, 8.33%) and non-urosepsis groups (n = 6,842, 91.67%). LASSO regression identified eight predictive variables: postoperative IL-6, SAA, PCT/ALB, NLPR, PT, ALB, HCT, and neutrophil. Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 1.0, 0.90, and 0.88 for the training, validation, and test cohorts, respectively. A good model fit, strong calibration, and positive clinical utility were confirmed by the learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. Postoperative PCT/ALB, neutrophil, IL-6, ALB, and PT were identified as key predictors by the SHAP algorithm. A publicly accessible web application was developed to facilitate both patients and physicians (https://www.xsmartanalysis.com/model/list/predict/model/html?mid=29648&symbol=71lphm763138mj895nd8). CONCLUSIONS: A robust, interpretable model based on postoperative laboratory biomarkers was successfully developed and validated. This model exhibits excellent predictive performance and clinical utility, and the integration of SHAP analysis provides transparent insights into the key drivers of urosepsis, offering a practical tool for early risk stratification and personalized intervention in clinical practice.

41421230,Mmu_Circ_0001022/hsa_Circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI axis suppressed the progression of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2026,"Sepsis -associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) contributes substantially to mortality and morbidity in critically ill individuals. Although considerable investigation has been conducted, effective therapeutic strategies preventing its advancement remain unavailable, highlighting the importance of understanding its fundamental mechanisms. Previous research identified mmu_circ_26986/hsa_circ_0072463 as a prospective biomarker and treatment target for SA-AKI. The current investigation reveals that mmu_circ_0001022 displays increased expression in BUMPT cells(Boston University Mouse Proximal Tubular Epithelial cell line)and C57BL/6 mouse kidneys following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Experimental analyses indicate that mmu_circ_0001022 diminishes LPS-triggered apoptosis in BUMPT cells. The molecular mechanism involves sequestering miRNA-92a-2-5p, subsequently enhancing SKI expression. Enhanced mmu_circ_0001022 expression reduces CLP-initiated acute kidney injury (AKI) progression through the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Research demonstrates that hsa_ circ_0056869, the mmu_circ_0001022 homologous form, reduces LPS-initiated apoptosis in HK-2 cells (Human Kidney 2 cell line) via the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Notably, septic patients experiencing AKI demonstrated elevated hsa_circ_0056869 plasma concentrations versus non-AKI cases. Analysis revealed hsa_circ_0056869 exhibited 79.41 % sensitivity, 82.35 % specificity, and 0.8175 area under the curve. A marked positive association emerged between hsa_circ_0056869 plasma levels and serum creatinine in septic individuals (r = 0.786). These findings establish the mmu_circ_0001022/hsa_circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway as significant in SA-AKI pathogenesis. In addition, our data indicate that hsa_circ_0056869 may serve as an early diagnosis marker for the septic AKI."
41421176,The diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin for sepsis in critically ill adults. A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Procalcitonin (PCT) has been a blue-eyed-boy in diagnosing sepsis in previous years. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis, according to the recent Sepsis-3 criteria, in adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We searched several electronic databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from the inception of the Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria (January 1, 2016) until May 31, 2025, for randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PCT for sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria among critically ill adult patients with suspected infection. We performed a random effect diagnostic meta-analysis, evaluated the risk of bias of individual studies using the QUADAS tool, and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: We included 10 studies comprising 1098 patients. Of these, 635 patients were diagnosed with sepsis based on Sepsis-3 criteria, including 89 patients with septic shock. The pooled sensitivity of PCT for diagnosing sepsis was 0.72 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 0.68-0.75, low certainty) and the pooled specificity was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.61-0.69, low certainty). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 2.45 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 1.62-3.68), The negative likelihood ratio was 0.38 (95 % CI, 0.28-0.53), and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 7.08 (95 % CI, 3.69-13.58). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of PCT was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.73-0.86). CONCLUSION: Based on pooled analysis, PCT has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of sepsis in ICU patients with suspected infection. These results suggest clinicians should be cautious about using PCT to facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults with suspected infection. Given the ongoing uncertainty, further high-quality data in this population is needed."
41420530,Diagnostic and Prognostic Evaluation of Presepsin Levels in Neonatal Septicemia: A Hospital-Based Study.,2025,"AIMS: Neonatal septicemia is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, and its early diagnosis remains a major challenge. Rapid and reliable biomarkers are essential for timely management. Presepsin, a soluble CD14 subtype, has emerged as a promising early sepsis marker, though evidence in neonates is scarce. This study evaluated its diagnostic and prognostic performance in suspected neonatal sepsis, covering bacterial and fungal infections. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary hospital from May 2023 to November 2024. Eighty-eight neonates with clinically suspected sepsis were enrolled. Blood samples were collected for culture, C-reactive protein (CRP) measured by semiquantitative latex agglutination and Presepsin measured by ELISA. Diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic analysis, and associations with clinical features, birth weight, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Blood cultures were positive in 57 (64.8%) neonates, including 39 bacterial and 18 fungal cases. Presepsin levels were significantly higher in culture-proven sepsis (1208.5 +/- 319.4 pg/mL) than probable sepsis (828.9 +/- 235.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001). ROC analysis identified a cutoff of 906.6 pg/mL, yielding 90% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 84% diagnostic accuracy. Presepsin levels rose faster than CRP, enabling earlier detection. Higher levels were noted in fungal sepsis (1441.4 +/- 357.5 pg/mL) and in neonates with poor outcomes, correlating with longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin is a rapid, reliable biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of neonatal sepsis, including fungal infections. Its use alongside clinical assessment can support timely therapeutic decisions, reduce hospital stay, and improve survival in high-risk neonates."
41420075,Proteinase 3 is involved in presepsin production through neutrophil extracellular trap phagocytosis by macrophages.,2025,"Presepsin (P-SEP), a soluble subtype of CD14, is widely recognized as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its production remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether M1 macrophages (M1 MPhis) contribute to P-SEP generation by phagocytosing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and degrading NET-derived CD14 through intracellular proteinase 3 (PR3). M1 MPhis were differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors, and NETs were induced in neutrophils stimulated with Escherichia coli or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA. Co-cultures of M1 MPhis and NETs were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blotting. The effects of PR3 inhibition (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or elafin) and phagocytosis inhibition (cytochalasin D or wortmannin) on P-SEP production were also evaluated. Recombinant CD14 (rCD14) was used in an in vitro cleavage assay to confirm PR3-dependent CD14 fragmentation. M1 MPhis actively phagocytosed citrullinated histone H3-positive NETs and produced intracellular P-SEP. P-SEP levels strongly correlated with the percentage of NETs (r = 0.907). Inhibition of PR3 activity or phagocytosis significantly reduced P-SEP production. Furthermore, incubation of rCD14 with PR3 produced P-SEP, and this effect was blocked by PR3 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate that PR3 contributes to P-SEP production through CD14 cleavage following NET phagocytosis by M1 MPhis. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the P-SEP biogenesis and advances the understanding of its role as a biomarker in sepsis.

41419730,"MIDAS: rapid, multiplexed molecular profiling for integrated host-pathogen analysis.",2025,"Addressing the need for integrated molecular analysis in complex infectious conditions requires technologies that rapidly quantify both pathogens and host responses. This is particularly relevant in sepsis research, where existing tools typically measure either microbial or host biomarkers. Here, we present MIDAS (Multiplexed Intelligent Diffraction Analysis System), a proof-of-concept platform that integrates shape-encoded hydrogel particles with lens-free diffraction imaging and deep learning-based analysis to enable simultaneous quantification of bacterial RNA and inflammatory proteins in a single system optimized for potential point-of-care use. The assay completes multiplexed measurements in under 4 h, significantly faster than standard culture workflows ( ~ 20-40 h). Beyond spiked studies, MIDAS is evaluated using specimens from a clinically relevant porcine sepsis model, showing high concordance with culture, qPCR and ELISA. Although further clinical validation is required, this flexible platform may support the development of accessible host-pathogen profiling tools with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, and beyond."
41419476,Distinct gastrointestinal microbial signatures predict parasite levels in controlled Plasmodium infections in both rhesus macaques and humans.,2025,"Functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome include maintenance of immune homeostasis and protection against infectious disease. Current assessments of the role of the GI microbiome in Plasmodium infection have been primarily conducted using mouse models and observational human cohorts. Here, we experimentally assessed associations between pre-infection GI microbiome composition and acute Plasmodium parasitemia using 16S rRNA sequencing and samples from rhesus macaques (RMs) and adult humans enrolled in a previously conducted controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trial (NCT04072302) originally designed to test the efficacy of KAF156, a novel imidazolopiperazine class of antimalarial drugs. We identified distinct pre-infection 16S microbial signatures that were associated with increased risk for above median parasitemia in RMs infected with P. fragile and CHMI participants infected with P. falciparum. Further, we identified a Bifidobacterium feature set that accurately stratified parasitemia risk and could therefore serve as a foundation for a potential biomarker panel to aid prevention efforts in malaria endemic regions. Together, our findings demonstrate that pre-infection GI microbiome composition is indicative of risk for Plasmodium parasitemia, and our observation that the pre-infection microbiome-P. fragile dynamic in RMs mirrors the pre-infection microbiome-P. falciparum interaction in CHMI participants supports the future use of this model in pre-clinical investigations of novel microbiome-targeting approaches to reduce malaria burden."
41419365,"Development and validation of a pre-trained language model for neonatal morbidities: a retrospective, multicentre, prognostic study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification and monitoring of neonatal morbidities are critical for timely interventions that can prevent complications, optimise resource use, and support families. Although traditional tools based on tabular data and biomarkers are beneficial, they are restricted in assessing the risk of morbidities in newborns. In this study, we developed NeonatalBERT, a pre-trained large language model (LLM) that estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from clinical notes. METHODS: This prognostic study investigated retrospective primary and external cohorts from two different quaternary-care academic medical centres in the USA: Stanford Health Care and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. NeonatalBERT was initially pre-trained on clinical notes from the primary cohort and then fine-tuned separately for both cohorts. NeonatalBERT was also compared against other existing LLMs, such as BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT, as well as traditional machine learning and logistic regression models using tabular features. NeonatalBERT was evaluated on 19 neonatal morbidities (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, atelectasis, aspiration syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal seizures, other CNS disorders, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiovascular instability, sepsis, candidiasis, anaemia, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death) for the primary cohort and ten for the external cohort (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death). For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and F1 scores were evaluated. FINDINGS: 32 321 newborns were included in the primary cohort, including 27 411 in the primary training set (mean gestational age 38.64 weeks [SD 2.30]; 13 056 [47.6%] female and 14 355 [52.4%] male newborns) and 4910 in the primary testing set (mean gestational age 38.64 [2.13] weeks; 2336 [47.6%] female and 2574 [52.4%] male newborns). Additionally, 7061 newborns were selected into the external cohort, including 5653 in the external training set (1567 [27.7%] premature and 4086 [72.3%] term births; 2614 [46.2%] female and 3039 [53.8%] male newborns) and 1408 in the external testing set (383 [27.2%] premature and 1025 [72.8%] term births; 624 [44.3%] female and 784 [55.7%] male newborns). In the primary cohort, the mean AUPRC over 19 outcomes was 0.291 (95% CI 0.268-0.314) for NeonatalBERT, 0.238 (0.217-0.259) for Bio-ClinicalBERT, 0.217 (0.197-0.236) for BioBERT, and 0.194 (0.177-0.211) for the traditional model using tabular data. In the external cohort, NeonatalBERT had a mean AUPRC of 0.360 (0.328-0.393), outperforming other models with the range of 0.224-0.333. INTERPRETATION: Based on validation using two large-scale US datasets, NeonatalBERT effectively estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from unstructured clinical notes of newborns. The promising results from this study show the potential of NeonatalBERT to enhance neonatal care and streamline hospital operations.

41418999,"Damage-associated Molecular Patterns, Immunothrombosis, and Intravascular Inflammation in Sepsis: A Narrative Integrative Review.",2025,"Sepsis is now considered a dysregulated host response in which inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial injury converge to create a self-amplifying network of thromboinflammation. This definition reflects maladaptive immunothrombosis-a defense mechanism that becomes pathogenic when excessive, rather than an isolated inflammatory process. This review integrates recent mechanistic advances linking damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), endothelial dysfunction, and intravascular coagulation. Endogenous alarmins, such as high-mobility group box 1, histones, and mitochondrial DNA, engage in pattern recognition (Toll-like receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products) to propagate leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation, and endothelial disruption. The resulting loss of critical endothelial anticoagulant molecules (thrombomodulin, endothelial cell protein C receptor, antithrombin) and glycocalyx degradation convert the vascular endothelium into a procoagulant interface. Complement activation and protease-activated receptor signaling reinforce this loop, producing microvascular thrombosis, capillary leakage, and organ ischemia. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) serve as intravascular scaffolds for fibrin deposition, thereby propagating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Targeted interventions, including recombinant thrombomodulin, antithrombin supplementation, neutralization of NETs and DAMPs, complement blockade, and endothelial-protective strategies, seek to restore vascular homeostasis. A multidomain biomarker approach integrating DAMPs, endothelial markers, and coagulation indices, combined with machine learning-based phenotyping, may enable precision stratification of sepsis endotypes. The convergence of DAMP signaling, immune activation, and coagulation underlies the pathophysiologic continuum from sepsis-induced coagulopathy to DIC. Therapeutically interrupting this axis represents the most promising avenue toward personalized, mechanism-driven treatment in sepsis."
41418639,RETN stratification identifies a highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes in early stage of polytrauma.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Despite early survival, many polytrauma patients ultimately succumb to sepsis driven by trauma-induced immunosuppression. The emergence of HLA-DR(low) monocytes was recognized as a biomarker of immunosuppression, yet they are heterogeneous, and reduced HLA-DR expression does not consistently correlate with global monocyte impairment. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the heterogeneity of HLA-DR(low) monocytes and clarify their specific contributions to immunosuppression. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) were applied to delineate the temporal differentiation trajectories of monocyte subsets post-trauma, leading to the identification of a distinct RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes and characterization of its immunosuppressive functions. Finally, we established a clinical cohort and used published datasets to explore its predictive capacity for sepsis in polytrauma patients. RESULTS: ScRNA-seq and FCA revealed quantitative and functional reprogramming across monocyte subsets and identified a conserved RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) subset enriched in polytrauma patients, characterized by reduced HLA-DR and elevated RETN expression. This subset exhibited profound impairments in core monocyte functions-including antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and cytokine production-compared to other monocyte subsets. Notably, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes can predict sepsis more accurately than HLA-DR(low) monocytes at 72 h (AUC: 0.89 vs. 0.74) post-trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a distinct functional monocyte subset, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes, with markedly impaired hallmark monocyte functions. RETN expression can identify this highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes. In polytrauma patients, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes provided more accurate prediction of sepsis than total HLA-DR(low) monocytes."
41417946,Lipid peroxidation-induced neurocardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients with septic shock.,2025,"CONTEXT: Septic shock's fatal signs include hemodynamic collapse, systemic inflammation, and organ failure. Neurocardiac dysfunctions worsen outcomes, with lipid peroxidation from oxidative stress as a key damage mechanism. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study is to investigates how lipid peroxidation in cell membranes generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial damage, cell death, and autonomic dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), toxic byproducts, contribute to cardiomyocyte injury, endothelial damage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and altered neuronal signalling. The research analyzes preclinical and clinical data associating sepsis oxidative indicators with poorer cardiac and neurological outcomes. Results: chronological relationship between oxidative stress, cardiac damage, and neural injury. While the visualisation highlights elevated biomarker levels in critically ill neurocardiac patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, risk classification, and focused treatment for septic shock may benefit from understanding neurocardiac dysfunction and lipid peroxidation."
41416069,The diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III activity for sepsis-induced coagulopathy in septic patients: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), therefore, studying the diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III (AT-III) activity in SIC may be useful for early identification and intervention of SIC. METHODS: This study is a single-center cohort study, prospectively enrolling patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU from March 2023 to March 2024. Based on whether the SIC score was greater than or equal to 4, the enrolled sepsis patients were divided into the SIC group and the non-SIC group. The SIC scoring system consists of three parameters: International normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The measurement of AT-III activity was completed within 12 h of the patient being admitted to the ICU. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of different biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of SIC. The DeLong Test was employed to compare whether there was a significant difference between AUCs. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted and Log-rank test was performed to compare the 28-day survival rates among different groups. RESULTS: This study included a total of 366 patients with sepsis, among which 235 (64.2%) were in the SIC group and 131 (35.8%) were in the non-SIC group. The AT-III activity in the SIC group was significantly lower than that in the non-SIC group (P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC for AT-III activity was 0.799 (P < 0.001), the AUC for platelets was 0.806 (P < 0.001), the AUC for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 0.746 (P < 0.001), and the AUC for international normalized ratio (INR) was 0.765 (P < 0.001). The results of the DeLong Test showed that the AUC for AT-III activity in diagnosing SIC had no statistically significant difference compared with the AUCs of the traditional diagnostic indicators, including platelets, SOFA score, and INR (P > 0.05). The cut-off value of AT-III activity for diagnosing SIC is 59.7%, with a sensitivity of 79.91%, specificity of 69.77%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 82.59%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 65.94%. There was no statistical difference in AT-III activity between the survival and non-survival groups of SIC patients (P > 0.05). The proportion of shock and the duration of vasopressor use were both lower in the high AT-III group (>/= 59.7%) than in the low AT-III group < 59.7%) (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the 28-day survival probability between the high AT-III group and the low AT-III group (P = 0.350). CONCLUSION: AT-III activity is a potentially helpful adjunctive biomarker for diagnosing SIC that performs similarly to the biomarkers and scores currently used to diagnose SIC."
41415274,Multiplexed longitudinal analysis of the cellular and microbial dynamics of acute polymicrobial sepsis in mice.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Acute polymicrobial sepsis is a life-threatening emergency caused by the body's immune response to bloodstream infection by two or more microbes. Early detection and management of sepsis have been the focus of global survey programs, driven by its association with hospital readmissions and long-term adverse health outcomes. METHODS: Animal models are essential tools for studying mechanisms of sepsis pathogenesis and the only way to empirically dissect the acute phase of disease. With this in mind, the goal of the current study was two-fold: to demonstrate the feasibility of performing multiplexed longitudinal assessment of acute sepsis pathogenesis and to emphasize the granularity with which acute sepsis can be studied using this method. Using the fecal suspension test (FST) model of acute polymicrobial sepsis in C57BL/6 mice we simultaneously characterize hematological, immunological, and microbiological aspects of acute sepsis induction. RESULTS: Our data shows that high dimensional flow cytometry paired with flow-based plasma cytokine measurements captures the dynamic shift from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory immune responses during an acute septic event; highlighting the role of emergency myelopoiesis in this process. Additionally, myeloid cell heterogeneity is characterized and strongly implicates the emergence of myeloid derived suppressor like cells (MDSC-like cells) as central to this switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 16S-based method for studying the blood biome that allows for discrimination between endogenous (bacterial DNAemia) and exogenous (actively growing bacteria in blood) sources of microbial DNA. Using this approach, we demonstrate that polymicrobial sepsis in our model is due to outgrowth of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus; two genera of bacterial pathobionts commonly observed in human sepsis patients. Finally, using several assessments of disease severity, we demonstrate stratification of septic mice into survivors and non-survivors and show how pre-septic immune assessment can be used to identify potential biomarkers of sepsis risk. DISCUSSION: Collectively, the approach we describe simultaneously reduces research animal use, strengthens scientific rigor, provides a pre-clinical platform for biomarker discovery and the study of therapeutic interventions, and most importantly advances our ability to study the acute phase of sepsis that carries a high mortality rate and is difficult to prospectively study in humans."
41413709,Prospective observational study of cell-free DNA as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis: COVSEP-study.,2025,"Hyperinflammation and extensive cell damage characterize both COVID-19-sepsis and bacterial sepsis, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), reflects ongoing tissue injury and may predict mortality. We aimed to evaluate cfDNA as a prognostic biomarker for 30-day mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19- vs. bacterial sepsis, and its association with inflammatory markers and disease progression. In a prospective observational study (ethics approval: 2020-15,535; DRKS-ID: DRKS00025222), cfDNA was quantified in 64 ICU patients (COVID-19-sepsis n = 27, bacterial sepsis n = 37) at four time points using quantitative PCR targeting 90 bp and 222 bp fragments of LINE-1 elements. An Integrity Index (222/90 bp) was calculated to infer the predominant mode of cell death. Nineteen healthy individuals served as controls. Associations with mortality and clinical parameters were analyzed using adjusted Cox regression, time-dependent models, and correlation analyses. Higher cfDNA levels (90 bp) within the first 24 h were strongly associated with 30-day (p = 0.003) and 180-day mortality (p = 0.003) in COVID-19-sepsis, but not in bacterial sepsis. COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher cfDNA levels (p < 0.01), which correlated with CRP, PCT, LDH, and lactate. The Integrity Index increased over time in bacterial sepsis and remained stable in COVID-19-sepsis, but was not predictive of survival. Elevated cfDNA levels were associated with ECMO therapy but not with renal replacement therapy. cfDNA is a valuable early prognostic biomarker in COVID-19-sepsis. Its rapid dynamics and strong correlation with clinical outcomes highlight its potential for real-time monitoring and risk stratification in viral sepsis."
41412563,Interferon regulatory factor 1 promotes pyroptosis and inflammation in mouse sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.,2026,"Although pyroptosis is involved in sepsis and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanims of myocardial pyroptosis in the progression of SIC. We first identified differentially expressed genes and hub pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in SIC using bioinformatics analyses and then constructed in vitro and in vivo SIC models to reveal the specific mechanisms of hub PRGs in SIC development. In this study, we confirmed eight hub PRGs (caspase-1, IRF1, IL-6, GSDMD, caspase-6, IL-1beta, caspase-8, and ZBP1) as potential candidate biomarkers for SIC and their expression change in cardiac tissue and myocardial cells in sepsis was fully validated through a serials of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, KEGG analysis displayed that these hub PRGs were enriched for NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways and IRF1 is an upstream regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. SIC mice treated with IRF1 inhibitor, N-acetyl- l-cysteine (NAC), showed notable amelioration of cardiac histological injury, reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, and decreased expression of NLRP3, pyroptosis-related markers, and pro-inflammatory factors. The IRF1-knockdown H9C2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pyroptosis-related markers. Overall, these findings suggest that IRF1 deficiency attenuates sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting pyroptosis and inflammation. Therefore, targeting IRF1 in cardiomyocytes may be a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing SIC."
41412306,"Characteristics of invasive group B streptococcal infections in adults and older individuals in a super-aging society in Japan, 2016-2023.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract, can cause invasive GBS (iGBS) infections, particularly in older adults with underlying comorbidities. We determined the relationship between mortality and host-related or virulence factors in older adults with iGBS infections. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 105 cases of iGBS infection treated between January 2016 and October 2023 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and two affiliated hospitals. The association between patient outcomes and demographics, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, medical treatment, biomarkers, antimicrobial agents used at admission, and capsular type of GBS isolates was examined. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 78 years (interquartile range, 64-85 years), and 89.5 % had underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and malignancies. Common clinical manifestations include skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and urosepsis. The overall mortality rate was 11.4 %. White blood cell (WBC) counts (breakpoint,10 x 10(3)/muL) on admission were significantly lower in fatal cases (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 9.6), but no significant differences were observed for other biomarkers. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 28-day survival was associated with WBC count (P < 0.001). The most common capsular type was Ib, followed by type V. Levofloxacin resistance was predominantly identified in type Ib. No significant association was found between capsular type and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Effective prevention of iGBS infections in older individuals requires large-scale surveillance, including environmental factors, and the development of comprehensive and multifaceted prevention strategies for high-risk older populations."
41409941,Study of a Semi-quantitative Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Procalcitonin Detection in Postpartum Sepsis Diagnosis.,2025,"Introduction Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge, causing millions of deaths annually and highlighting the urgent need for rapid diagnostic tools. This study evaluated the performance of a semi-quantitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for procalcitonin (PCT) detection in postpartum sepsis diagnosis, addressing the critical need for point-of-care testing (POCT) in resource-limited settings. Methods A prospective, single-center validation study was conducted with 59 postpartum women enrolled from routine postpartum checkups. The study population included 25 healthy controls, 20 postpartum women without sepsis, and 14 with confirmed sepsis. All participants underwent PCT testing using both the semi-quantitative LFIA and reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Analytical performance parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and clinical correlation, were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal cut-off values. Results The PCT LFIA demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 96.2% (95% CI: 88.2%-99.4%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CI: 87.5%-99.8%) at a cut-off of 0.5 ng/mL. The assay showed strong correlation with reference ELISA methods (r > 0.97) and maintained precision with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 3.2% to 6.5% and inter-assay variation from 4.6% to 8.9%. The limit of detection (LoD) was 0.5 ng/mL with a limit of quantification (LoQ) of 1.0 ng/mL. Postpartum women with sepsis showed significantly elevated PCT levels compared to healthy controls and those without sepsis. Conclusion The semi-quantitative PCT LFIA offers a promising, cost-effective tool for rapid sepsis diagnosis in postpartum women. The assay's high sensitivity and specificity, combined with its point-of-care applicability, make it particularly valuable for improving maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings where timely sepsis diagnosis is crucial."
41408558,Predicting mortality in critically ill patients: a machine learning approach to electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors.,2025,"The study aimed to enhance ICU mortality prediction by integrating electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors using machine learning, addressing gaps in traditional severity scores like SOFA and APACHE II. Dominant Predictors of Mortality: SOFA score >/= 8 (aOR = 4.0), mechanical ventilation (aOR = 3.1), hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L; aOR = 2.6), vasopressor use (aOR = 2.7), and GCS </= 8 (aOR = 2.4). High-Risk Phenotypes: ""Triad of Death"" (SOFA >/= 8 + mechanical ventilation + vasopressors), metabolic crisis (lactate > 4 mmol/L + pH < 7.2), and frail elderly (age >/= 65 with comorbidities). The XGBoost model achieved superior discrimination (AUC-ROC = 0.86) compared to logistic regression (AUC = 0.84), SOFA (AUC = 0.72), and APACHE II (AUC = 0.75). A nomogram was developed to stratify mortality risk into four actionable tiers (e.g., scores > 150 predicted > 60% mortality). The model performed consistently across subgroups (sepsis, age strata, AKI stages), with AUCs > 0.80. Sepsis patients: Lactate and vasopressor use were stronger predictors (38% contribution to SHAP values) Early correction of modifiable factors (e.g., sepsis, acidosis) may improve outcomes. The nomogram offers a practical bedside tool for risk stratification and clinical decision-making."
41408335,Pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury: a case report and review of the literature.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease that is rarely diagnosed in Europe. Its clinical presentation is highly variable, requiring consideration of a broad differential diagnosis. METHODS: We present a case report of a pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury, and a systematic review of the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 73-year-old white man who presented with pneumonia, sepsis and acute kidney injury due to a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with negativity for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Initial management with dialysis, empirical antibiotics, and immunosuppression was adjusted after identification of Francisella tularensis, and targeted antibiotic therapy was administered successfully. At 4 years of follow-up, no recurrence was observed. LITERATURE REVIEW: Our review of the literature identified only a few case reports of tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury. None documented biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury is an uncommon clinical constellation. Biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negativity in this setting appears to be very rare. Careful differential diagnosis, early recognition of tularemia, and timely initiation of effective antibiotic therapy are critical to achieving favorable outcomes."
41407463,[The clinical study of azacitidine and lenalidomide combination in myelodysplastic neoplasm patients with TP53 mutations].,2025,"Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of azacitidine combined with lenalidomide in MDS patients and explore potential mechanisms of therapeutic response. Methods: Sixteen MDS patients with TP53 mutations received azacitidine plus lenalidomide at ZhongDa Hospital, Southeast University (January 2021-June 2025). Efficacy and safety were assessed, and TP53 mutation status was correlated with treatment response. Whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics were used to explore molecular biomarkers associated with therapeutic efficacy. Results: Sixteen patients (median age 69.5 years, range 52-82; 8 males, 8 females) were enrolled. According to the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M), 1, 2, and 13 patients were classified as median low, high, and very high risk, respectively. Among 16 TP53-mutated patients, 11 had biallelic mutations and 5 had monoallelic mutations. Overall response rate was 56.3% (9/16), composite complete remission rate (CRc) was 31.3% (5/16), and hematology improvement rate was 25% (4/16). Among TP53-mutated patients, the response rate was 56.3% (9/16), with variant allele frequency dropping from 65.6% to 16.5% in responders (P=0.017). In patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotype, response rate was 53.8% (7/13), with 57.1% (4/7) showing disappearance of CK post-treatment. The most common grade 3-4 nonhematologic adverse events were infections (9/16, 56.3% ), including pneumonia (4/16, 25.0% ), gastrointestinal infections (3/16, 18.8% ), perianal infections (1/16, 6.3% ) and sepsis (1/16, 6.3% ). High CBX8 expression may be linked to treatment response. Conclusion: Azacitidine plus lenalidomide is an effective and safe therapy for MDS, including patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotypes. Treatment markedly reduces TP53 variant allele frequency in responders, and high CBX8 expression may predict therapeutic response."
41405037,Risk for sepsis during mechanical circulatory support bigstar.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) risk the development of sepsis. Examining risk factors for the development of sepsis and their relationships to MCS may allow for an improved understanding of these complications. METHODS: Following IRB approval, patient characteristics, previously reported comorbidities, and the incidence of sepsis were studied in 199 patients who received 244 MCS therapies from January 2017 to October 2023. The clinical variables underwent ensemble machine learning modeling. Significant comorbidities predicting sepsis from the ensemble machine modeling underwent decision-tree analysis. RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of sepsis was 20% (95% CI: 16-26%). Following machine learning modeling, patients with a history of congestive heart failure or a history of previous cardiac surgery were associated with an increased risk for developing sepsis. The c-index statistic for this model was 0.76, with a misclassification rate of 19%. Decision-tree analysis observed that patients without chronic cardiovascular disease but with a history of prior cardiac surgery have a 60.3% (95% CI: 60.1-65.2%) incidence of sepsis during MCS therapy. Patients with a history of chronic cardiovascular disease and with a history of congestive heart failure have an 18.1% (95% CI: 17.2-18.7%) incidence of developing sepsis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of sepsis is high in this patient population. The novel associations of patients who have histories of congestive heart failure or previous cardiac surgery requiring MCS suggest an increased systemic inflammatory state exists that escalates the risk for developing sepsis. Further investigation into these background inflammatory conditions in patients requiring MCS is warranted."
41404282,Immune subphenotypes of tuberculosis and mortality in adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis causes high mortality among people living with HIV in Africa, yet immune response data are limited. We identified immune subphenotypes of adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa. METHODS: We determined the association of serum cytokine and antibody concentrations with CD4+ T-cell and blood lactate concentration, tuberculosis, and 30-day mortality with K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and logistic regression. We validated results in a separate cohort of adults with sepsis in East Africa. RESULTS: Of 208 participants in the discovery cohort, 117 (56%) were female and 175 (84%) were living with HIV, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 35 (+/-10) years. Participants with tuberculosis had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1MCAF, whereas mortality was associated with higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP-1beta, and lower concentrations of IgM antibodies against oxidation-specific epidopes (IgM (OSE) ). PCA identified G-CSF, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 as the main contributors to tuberculosis, and IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-13 as the main contributors to mortality. Comprehensive biomarker and clinical and multivariable models accurately predicted tuberculosis (AUC = 0.84) and mortality (AUC = 0.78), which was replicated in the validation cohort. Cross-testing showed that the tuberculosis model delineated pathogen-specific immune activation, while the mortality model represented non-pathogen-specific immune dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with sepsis and high HIV prevalence in East Africa, tuberculosis was associated with pathogen-specific inflammation, and mortality was associated with broader immune dysregulation and diminished IgM (OSE) antibody responses."
41404203,Sepsis-Induced Myocardial Dysfunction and Its Prognostic Implications for Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of morbidity in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, yet its direct impact on mortality remains uncertain. This systematic review synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the association between SIMD and outcomes in septic patients. Echocardiographic and biomarker-based assessments consistently demonstrated that SIMD is a frequent and often reversible complication of sepsis, associated with greater disease severity and impaired hemodynamics. Pharmacological interventions such as levosimendan and Xinmailong infusion were found to improve surrogate measures of cardiac function, yet none conferred a significant survival benefit at 28 days. While advanced imaging modalities like speckle-tracking echocardiography enhanced diagnostic sensitivity, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and outcome definitions limited the strength of pooled conclusions. Overall, SIMD appears to be a clinically relevant marker of illness severity, but current evidence does not establish it as an independent predictor of mortality. Larger multicenter trials with standardized diagnostic frameworks and long-term follow-up are required to clarify its prognostic role and to determine whether targeted therapies can alter patient outcomes."
41403607,Causal associations of circulating inflammatory proteins with sepsis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis arises from dysregulated inflammation in response to infection, precipitating organ dysfunction. Circulating inflammatory mediators likely contribute to sepsis pathogenesis, but their precise roles remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate potential causal impacts of inflammatory proteins on sepsis risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization study evaluating causal associations for 91 inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. Genetic instruments were derived from a published genome-wide association study of plasma proteins. Sepsis outcome data were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen cohort. Inverse-variance weighted analysis was conducted along with several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The analyses identified significant causal associations for several inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. TRAIL exhibited a causal effect on increased overall sepsis risk (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17). CCL28 showed a causal link to higher 28-day sepsis mortality in critical care (OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.18-9.29). CCL4 demonstrated a causal association with increased 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06-1.31). Meanwhile, beta-NGF was found to be causally protective for sepsis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99), and TNFB also showed a causally protective effect (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates roles of inflammatory mediators in sepsis pathogenesis. The identified proteins may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. TRAIL signaling inhibition may hold promise for future clinical translation given its causal links to increased sepsis risk and mortality. CCL28 and CCL4 also represent potential immunological drivers of sepsis mortality worthy of further investigation. Meanwhile, the neurotrophins beta-NGF and TNFB emerged as having protective effects in sepsis that could be therapeutically augmented. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm the observed causal relationships. Our findings provide targets for future mechanistic and clinical examination to impact patient prognosis."
41402459,Outcomes of septic shock from urinary and non-urinary sources in nonagenarians and centenarians admitted to intensive care units.,2025,"Although sepsis-related mortality has declined with advances in care, the incidence of septic shock is rising by 1-8% annually. As life expectancy increases, the >/= 90-year-old population is projected to reach 10 million in the U.S. by 2050, highlighting septic shock as a growing public health burden. Despite urinary tract infections being a common cause, non-urinary sources may carry higher mortality. However, outcome data in nonagenarians and centenarians are limited. This study compares outcomes by infection source in ICU patients aged 90 years or older with septic shock. This retrospective study, approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee (No. 253/24), used de-identified data from the ANZICS Adult Patient Database (2010-2023), including nonagenarian and centenarian ICU patients with septic shock. Variables included demographics, comorbidities, frailty, severity scores, and 24-h biomarkers. Outcomes were mortality by infection source and length of stay. Propensity score matching ensured covariate balance. Time-dependent Cox models and AUROC analysis were used. Complete case analysis was performed, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Among 1095 ICU patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher short-term mortality compared to urinary sources, even after propensity matching (300-day HR 1.348; p = 0.012). ICU mortality (15.7% vs. 8.6%) and hospital mortality (29.0% vs. 17.3%) were also higher in the non-urinary group. APACHE III score, but not age or SOFA score, predicted mortality. Urine output and arterial pH were the best mortality discriminators for non-urinary and urinary sources, respectively. Higher SOFA and APACHE III scores were linked to shorter hospital stays, but not ICU length of stay. In critically ill patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, infection source was an independent, time-dependent predictor of mortality. Non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher mortality than urinary tract infections for the first 300 days, despite comparable illness severity. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of infection source and its role in early risk stratification, triage, and end-of-life planning. Simple physiological markers, including urine output and arterial pH, demonstrated additional discriminatory value. As the very elderly ICU population grows, integrating infection source and early physiological indicators into tailored prognostic tools is essential to guide individualized, efficient care in high-resource critical care settings."
41401657,Metformin diminishes lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy: Molecular insights on vascular endothelial growth factor-A and its receptors.,2026,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a hypoxia- and cytokine-inducible biomarker of endothelial activation, together with its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, contributes to endotoxemia and early sepsis-related vascular dysfunction by increasing permeability and tissue edema. The current research explored the dose-dependent therapeutic effects of metformin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia with cardiopulmonary dysfunction and microvascular coagulopathy in male Wistar rats. Endotoxemia was induced by a single intraperitoneal LPS injection, and metformin was administered at 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg. Metformin dose-dependently improved survival and attenuated LPS-induced tachycardia, QTc prolongation, ST-segment elevation, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and elevations in serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced VEGF-A, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 expression in cardiopulmonary tissues, with the 400 mg/kg dose nearly restoring normal levels. KEGG and Reactome analyses revealed that VEGFR2 activation drives PI3K-Akt-eNOS, p38/HSP27, and MAPK/ERK pathways promoting endothelial permeability, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Molecular docking further confirmed potential interactions between metformin and key VEGF signaling proteins-VEGFR2, MAPK1, PDK1, and Src kinase-through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, supporting the predicted inhibitory mechanism. STRING protein-protein interaction analysis identified VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4) as central hubs linking angiogenic and adaptor proteins. Collectively, these experimental and computational findings indicate that metformin ameliorates LPS-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy via modulation of VEGF-A/VEGFR1/VEGFR2 signaling, providing mechanistic and translational insight into its potential endothelial-protective effects especially in comorbid patients on metformin maintenance therapy."
41400206,Sepsis and mucositis-related biomarkers in adult hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia.,2025,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of chemotherapy and potentially fatal. It is often associated with mucositis. Timely recognition of complications enables early supportive treatment and potentially reduces mortality. Common diagnostic parameters are often nonspecific or have slow kinetics. This study examines the applicability of mucosa-related biomarkers in the recognition of complicated course among 78 adult hematologic patients with FN after intensive chemotherapy. Plasma concentrations of citrulline, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)AGP), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were measured at the onset of fever and the following two days. All except ZO-1 showed a significant trend. Concentrations of CRP, PCT, citrulline and alpha(1)AGP were higher with a complicated course. Patients with severe sepsis had higher levels of PCT and lower levels of I-FABP. In conclusion, measurement of mucosa-related biomarkers might help predict the course of FN."
41399648,Prognostic Value of the Albumin Corrected Anion Gap in ICU Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Sepsis: A MIMIC-IV Cohort Study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at increased risk of sepsis, a condition associated with high mortality. The anion gap (AG) is commonly used to assess acid-base disturbances, but its reliability declines in hypoalbuminemia. The albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) may provide greater accuracy, yet its prognostic value in COPD patients with sepsis, defined according to Sepsis-3 criteria, remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2072 ICU patients with COPD and sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). Cox regression models evaluated the association between ACAG and mortality, Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated survival differences, restricted cubic splines examined nonlinear relationships, and subgroup analyses assessed consistency across strata. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared the predictive performance of ACAG, AG, and serum albumin. RESULTS: Elevated ACAG was independently associated with both short- and long-term mortality. In fully adjusted models, each 1 mmol/L increase in ACAG was linked to higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR 1.064, 95% CI 1.042-1.086, P < 0.001) and 365-day mortality (HR 1.065, 95% CI 1.043-1.087, P < 0.001). A threshold effect was observed at >/=19.25 mmol/L, above which mortality risk increased markedly (28-day HR 1.336, 95% CI 1.126-1.586, P = 0.001; 365-day HR 1.429, 95% CI 1.208-1.691, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed significant differences (log-rank P < 0.0001), and ROC analysis demonstrated that ACAG provided superior discrimination compared with AG and albumin for both 28-day (AUC = 0.734) and 365-day mortality (AUC = 0.696). Associations were consistent across clinical subgroups without significant interactions. CONCLUSION: Elevated ACAG was an independent predictor of 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD and sepsis. An inflection point of approximately 19.25 mmol/L identified a clinically meaningful threshold for risk stratification. As a simple and widely accessible parameter, ACAG may facilitate threshold-based triage and individualized management in this high-risk population, though external validation in multicenter prospective cohorts is warranted."
41399492,Identification of Co-Diagnostic Genes and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Asthma and Sepsis Through Mendelian Randomization and Immune Infiltration Analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between asthma and sepsis, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study explores the co-diagnostic genes and molecular links between asthma and sepsis using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and bioinformatics methods, and further validates the findings through clinical data, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets and drugs. METHODS: Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) data from an Icelandic population were used for two-sample MR analysis. Differential expression analysis identified common genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses explored biological functions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves validated gene performance, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT. Drug targets were predicted using DrugSigDB and validated by molecular docking. Clinical data of the three groups of people were collected, and baseline analysis, ROC curve analysis, and comparison of the expression levels of CXCL8 were carried out. RESULTS: At the genetic level, 435 genes related to asthma and 1,385 genes related to sepsis were identified, with 141 common genes. Further findings showed that there were 247 differentially expressed genes in asthma and 2,878 differentially expressed genes in sepsis, and 65 common differentially expressed genes were enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. The key gene CXCL8 exhibited excellent diagnostic performance and was closely related to immune cell subsets. Based on the research results, ten potential therapeutic drugs were screened, and seven of them were verified by molecular docking. Clinical sample testing results show that CXCL8 is closely related to asthma and sepsis. CONCLUSION: CXCL8 may be a biomarker for both asthma and sepsis. Immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, and T cells may drive comorbid progression. Potential drug candidates were identified, offering new insights for future research on these diseases."
41399368,Predicting ICU mortality in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm: a nomogram based on MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD.,2026,"Background: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), characterized by pathological aortic dilation, carries high mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. However, existing severity scores (e.g., SAPS III, SOFA) poorly capture AAA-specific mortality predictors. We aimed to develop a focused prognostic tool to improve short-term risk stratification in ICU-admitted AAA patients. Objective: To develop and validate a machine learning-based nomogram model using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV; 2008-2019) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD; 2014-2015) for early mortality prediction (</=7 days) in critically ill patients with AAA, addressing limitations of conventional ICU scoring systems by integrating AAA-specific predictors and ensuring generalizability through external validation. Methods: Using two independent datasets from MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, we identified patients with AAA with complete ICU records and lab data within 24 hours of admission. Critical predictors were selected via a dual approach: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to eliminate collinearity and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to rank feature importance. MIMIC-IV served as the training dataset, while eICU-CRD was used for external validation. A Cox regression-based nomogram was constructed using the training set and tested for 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality prediction. Model performance was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Results: Six key variables independently predicted mortality including age, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), antihypertensive drug use, average percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and anion gap. The nomogram demonstrated optimal predictive accuracy for 7-day mortality (AUC: 0.730 [training] and 0.718 [validation]; C-indices: 0.717 and 0.731), with reduced performance for 14-day and 28-day outcomes. Calibration curves displayed strong agreement at both 7 and 14 days, and DCA indicated that the model provides significant clinical value. External validation in eICU-CRD mirrored these trends (7-day AUC: 0.723), supporting model generalizability. Conclusion: This multicohort-derived nomogram provides a simple yet reliable tool to predict early mortality (</=7 days) in critically ill AAA patients, which may guide time-sensitive interventions in critical care settings."
41399335,Lactate/Albumin Ratio vs. NEWS-Lactate in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury Prognosis; Comment on Le Xuan at al. Study.,2025,"A study by Le Xuan et al. suggested that the lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) may aid in predicting sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. However, overlapping receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve confidence intervals, creatinine-only acute kidney injury (AKI) definitions, and single-point biomarker assessments limit interpretation. Given its single-centre retrospective design, broader validation with dynamic biomarkers and kidney-specific comparators is needed before the LAR can be integrated into sepsis risk stratification."
41398794,Association between neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients: Analysis from the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"The neutrophil count-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR), a composite biomarker of lipid metabolism and inflammation, has been regarded as an indicator for predicting clinical outcomes in patients suffering from acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. However, the association between the NHR and 28-day all-cause mortality in the sepsis population remains unclear. Our study population comprised 1018 sepsis patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV V2.2) database who were grouped into tertiles based on their NHRs. In this study, curve fitting and 2-piecewise regression models were utilized to analyze the dose-response relationship between the Log NHR and 28-day mortality. The mean age of the participants in the study cohort was 65.0 +/- 15.7 years, and 56.3% were men. The 28-day mortality rates for the NHR tertiles were 15% (51), 13.3% (45), and 18.2% (62). By investigating the Log NHR and 28-day mortality, we observed a clear U-shaped relationship. Threshold saturation analysis revealed that when Log NHR below 1.87 (NHR 6.50), with each 1-unit increase in the Log NHR, the risk of 28-day mortality significantly decreased (HR = 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.37, 1.01, P = .0526). Conversely, the logNHR for 28-day mortality increased beyond 1.87 (HR = 1.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.51; P = .0045). Stratified by age, our analysis revealed nuanced variations in the Log NHR and 28-day mortality association across different age groups. This study revealed a robust U-shaped relationship between the Log NHR and 28-day all-cause mortality in the sepsis population, with a critical threshold of Log NHR = 1.87 (NHR 6.50). This risk is influenced by age."
41398565,Association between serum uric acid to albumin ratio and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The serum uric acid to albumin ratio (UAR) is a recently recognized composite inflammatory biomarker that has not received sufficient attention in relation to sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the association between UAR and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a retrospective database of sepsis patients who were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University between January 2015 and November 2023. The patients were divided into four groups based on UAR quartiles. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were used to evaluate all-cause mortality among the four groups. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic splines were performed to examine the association between UAR and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of other variables on the relationship between UAR and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1123 patients (63.0% males) were included in this study. The in-hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates were 33.9% and 31.7%, respectively. There was a significant association between higher UAR levels and an increased cumulative incidence of 30-/60-day mortality (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the UAR was independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality [per SD increase in the UAR: hazard ratio (HR) (95%CI): 1.186 (1.067-1.319); P = 0.002] and ICU mortality [per SD increase in the UAR: HR (95%CI): 1.190 (1.068-1.327); P = 0.002]. Restricted cubic spline regression analysis illustrated a linear relationship between UAR and the risks of in-hospital and ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated UAR levels were strongly associated with all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis, suggesting their potential as predictors of poor outcomes. However, further studies are needed to validate our findings and investigate the underlying causal factors that could contribute to sepsis prevention and treatment.

41398250,Early prediction of vasopressor initiation in ICU sepsis patients using an interpretable EHR-based ML model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of septic patients who will require vasopressor support could provide a critical window for hemodynamic optimisation, yet current bedside cues often appear only when shock is imminent. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and validate an interpretable electronic health record (EHR)-based machine-learning model that predicts vasopressor initiation several hours before therapy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database (2008-2019). We screened adult Sepsis-3 ICU stays and labeled the patients who commenced continuous vasopressor infusions 6 to 48 hours after admission as cases; we defined controls as sepsis patients with ICU stays >/=48 hours and no vasopressor exposure. We performed one to one nearest neighbour matching on age, sex, Charlson index, SOFA score with the cardiovascular component removed, weight, and early lactate/hematocrit availability to minimise confounding. We engineered demographic, physiological, and laboratory features measured from -6 to -2 hours relative to vasopressor initiation (or a matched time point) under multiple parameter combinations. We trained seven algorithms with Monte Carlo cross validation and evaluated performance on an independent validation set. We assessed model interpretability with Shapley values. RESULTS: We analyzed 1,539 cases and 1,431 controls; the independent validation set comprised 751 stays (~25%). A Random Forest classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.79), a sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69-0.78), a specificity of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.60-0.70), a precision of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.66-0.74) and a F1 score of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.75) at the Youden's index threshold. The model outperformed simple surrogates-mean blood pressure (AUROC, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.64-0.72) and modified shock index (AUROC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.69)-and a reproduced bidirectional LSTM (AUROC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77). Key predictors included declining mean blood pressure at - 2 to -4 hours, elevated lactate ( > 2.5 mmol/L), and hematocrit outside 30-37%. Model alerts would occur two to four hours before vasopressor initiation, providing actionable lead time for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study shows that routinely collected ICU data can predict impending vasopressor initiation with clinically interpretable outputs. However, these findings reflect internal validation only and should be interpreted with caution. External validation on multi-center retrospective cohorts, followed by silent-mode prospective evaluation, is warranted to confirm generalisability and to assess the real-world impact on time-to-vasopressor, fluid balance, and patient outcomes."
41395980,"Artificial Intelligence in Anaesthesiology: Current Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions.",2025,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming anaesthesiology through advances in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. AI-driven tools now contribute to nearly every phase of perioperative care, including preoperative risk stratification, intraoperative monitoring, imaging interpretation, airway assessment, regional anaesthesia, and critical care. Applications such as automated American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, prediction of postoperative complications and intensive care unit needs, electroencephalography-based depth-of-anaesthesia estimation, and proactive haemodynamic management are reshaping clinical decision-making. AI-augmented echocardiography enhances chamber recognition and functional measurements, whereas computer vision systems support airway evaluation and ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia by providing real-time anatomical identification and facilitating training. In critical care, AI models facilitate the early detection of sepsis, organ dysfunction, and haemodynamic instability, while improving workflow efficiency and resource allocation. AI is increasingly used in academic writing, data processing, and medical education, offering opportunities for personalised learning and simulation but raising concerns about accuracy and hallucinations. In this review, we aimed to summarise the current applications of AI in anaesthesiology, highlight the methodological, ethical, and practical challenges that limit its integration, and discuss future directions for its safe and effective adoption in perioperative care."
41394771,"Identification of Aging-Related Hub Genes (ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160) as Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Sepsis.",2025,"Sepsis arises from a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to multiorgan inflammatory injury. Early diagnosis and treatment necessitate the identification of reliable immune biomarkers. This study investigated the relationship between aging, immunity, and sepsis by analyzing six human aging-related gene sets (656 genes). We identified 16 aging-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in sepsis. Among these, ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160 demonstrated the strongest connectivity with other genes and exhibited significant predictive power. Functional enrichment analysis (GO and KEGG) revealed distinct signaling pathway profiles between high-risk and low-risk sepsis groups (stratified based on risk scores). These dysregulated pathways, associated with multiple immune cells, were primarily linked to transcriptional dysregulation in cellular processes and cancer-related pathways. Experimental validation assays corroborated the roles of ATP11B and RBBP7. Collectively, our bioinformatic and experimental findings indicate that ATP11B, RBBP7, DOCK10, and NUP160 are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis. But their potential for sepsis biomarkers still requires further verification."
41394420,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: a potential supportive marker for elderly community-acquired bloodstream infections-a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Exploring the value of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a potential supportive marker in community-acquired bloodstream infection in elderly patients. METHODS: By reviewing the data of inpatients in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University from January 2012 to December 2021, a total of 58 elderly patients with community-acquired bloodstream infection and 174 inpatients without infection during the same period, matched for age, sex, and concomitant diseases, were included. Clinical data were collected and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, and concomitant diseases between the infected and non-infected groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that only increased NLR among leukocyte indexes was a risk factor for bloodstream infections. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of increased NLR to support the diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infections in the elderly were 0.72, 0.99, and 0.95; the optimal cut-off value is 8.0. CONCLUSION: The increase in NLR was superior to the rise of traditional white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Thus, NLR can be used as an indication for the early diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infection in the elderly. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for supporting the diagnosis of community-acquired bloodstream infections in elderly patients was determined to be 8.0. When NLR exceeds this threshold (> 8.0), it serves as a clinical alert for community physicians, indicating a significantly elevated probability of elderly patients developing community-acquired bloodstream infections."
41393148,Intestinal dysbiosis in critically ill patients: a case-control study of Enterobacteriaceae enrichment and reduced microbial diversity.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Critical illness disrupts gut microbiota homeostasis, potentially exacerbating systemic inflammation and adverse outcomes. This study investigates gut dysbiosis patterns in ICU patients, with a focus on Enterobacteriaceae enrichment and microbial diversity loss, to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this case-control study, 37 ICU patients (sepsis: n = 17; non-sepsis: n = 20) and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Fecal samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 regions). Microbial diversity (Shannon/Simpson indices), <mark>beta diversity (Bray-Curtis PCoA)</mark>, and taxonomic differences (LEfSe, LDA > 2.5) were analyzed using QIIME2 and R. RESULTS: Critically ill patients showed reduced alpha diversity vs. controls (Shannon p = 0.04; Simpson p = 0.04). Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) were significantly enriched in ICU patients (LDA = 4.2, p < 0.01), while Ruminococcus dominated controls. Beta diversity differed markedly (PERMANOVA R (2) = 0.199, p = 0.001). No diversity differences were observed between sepsis/non-sepsis subgroups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ICU patients exhibit gut dysbiosis characterized by Enterobacteriaceae expansion and diversity loss, independent of sepsis status. These findings underscore the gut microbiome's role in critical illness and support exploring microbiota-targeted interventions (e.g., selective probiotics) to improve outcomes."
41391701,Long-term immune and epigenetic dysregulation following COVID-19.,2026,"Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is heterogeneous in phenotype and functional state. This prospective, observational study studied adults six months after acute COVID-19. We defined clinical phenotypes and profiled plasma mediators grouped into functional pathways (IL-1, IL-17, IFNgamma/IFNgamma-related cytokines, pro-/anti-inflammatory clusters). A subset underwent RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. Three cohorts were analyzed (Exploratory n = 46; Discovery n = 591; Validation Cohort n = 289). PACS compatible symptoms were identified in 69.6 %; 59.2 % and 54.7 % respectively. Five phenotypes emerged. IL-1 cytokines (OR: 3.17, 95 % CIs: 1.94-5.19, p: 4.5 x 10(-6)), IL-17 cytokines (OR: 2.45, 95 % CIs: 1.47-4.07 p: 5.88 x 10(-4)) and the anti-inflammatory biomarkers (OR: 2.15, 95 % CIs: 1.34-3.45, p: 1.5 x 10(-3)) were upregulated in PACS patients. Respiratory phenotype was correlated with IL-1 upregulation (OR 4.23; 95 % CIs, 1.69-10.8, p = 0.0025). Transcriptomic and epigenomic changes were observed. Distinct phenotypes of PACS are driven by different immunological mechanisms at the DNA, transcriptomic, and protein levels."
41391567,A critical role for MALAT1 in gram-negative bacteria-induced coagulation via regulation of caspase-11 signaling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Our previous animal studies suggested the critical role of the type I interferon (IFNbeta) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) axis in coagulation; however, the predictive value of IFNbeta/HMGB1 for the clinical onset of septic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to further elaborate on the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated DIC and identify potential biomarkers suitable for the early prediction of DIC. METHODS: IFNbeta/HMGB1 plasma levels were measured in septic patients without DIC at admission. The onset of septic DIC was assessed 48 hours thereafter. We subsequently compared the leukocyte transcriptomes of patients with and without DIC. A series of genetically modified mice, including IFNalpha/betaR1(-/-), Tlr4(-/-), Malat1(-/-), Casp1(-/-), and Casp11(-/-) mice, as well as Malat1(flox/flox) or Gpx4(flox/flox) in combination with Cdh5-, Alb-, Vav- and Lyz2-Cre mice, were used to investigate the mechanisms. RESULTS: The plasma level of IFNbeta but not HMGB1 in septic patients showed a consistent correlation with the onset of DIC. We identified an HMGB1-bypassing signaling pathway in which IFNbeta stimulates macrophages to express high levels of the long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in response to gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of Malat1 specifically in macrophages restored glutathione exhaustion and enhanced glutathione peroxidase 4 activity by maintaining Yin-Yang 1-mediated Hba-a1 expression, which dampens lipopolysaccharide internalization and caspase-11 activation, and suppressed caspase-11/GSDMD-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure, thereby protecting against bacteria-induced coagulation. CONCLUSION: Our study unveils a novel immunocoagulation pathway in which MALAT1 fuels caspase-11-dependent coagulation by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 activity, which provides new insights into the coagulation mechanisms in bacterial sepsis."
41391076,Comparative Assessment of Cardiac Biomarkers and APACHE II Score for Prognostication in Septicemic Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiac dysfunction is one of the major causes of mortality in patients with sepsis. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), and other prognostic scores for sepsis have established data regarding their accuracy in predicting mortality. We have assessed the prognostic role of cardiac biomarkers [creatine phosphokinase-myocardial band (CPK-MB), troponin I (Trop I), and probrain natriuretic peptide (proBNP)] in patients with sepsis and compared it with the APACHE II score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 patients (63 in each group) participated in this case-control study in a large tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients with sepsis who required hospitalization were enrolled in the case group and compared with another group of nonsepticemic patients. They were taken for detailed evaluation and investigation on day 1 and day 3. Our study included proBNP, CPK-MB, Trop I, and APACHE II score. RESULTS: Both the case and control groups comprised 63 patients each. It was observed that the cardiac biomarkers (proBNP, Trop I, CPK-MB) were markedly higher among cases than in controls. Similarly, these markers were also found markedly higher in fatal cases than survivors in the case group. Out of all three biomarkers, proBNP was correlated well with mortality as much as the APACHE II score. It was also observed that increasing trends in the levels of biomarkers depict prognosis more effectively than a single value. CONCLUSION: We conclude that cardiac biomarkers can be routinely used as dynamic markers for the prediction of mortality and prognosis in patients with sepsis. ProBNP may be useful in predicting mortality in patients with sepsis."
41390809,Enhancing prognostic accuracy in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: a machine learning approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIMD) is a severe yet potentially reversible complication of sepsis, characterized by myocardial dysfunction and associated with high short-term mortality. Conventional scoring systems and traditional statistical models inadequately capture the complex pathophysiology of SIMD, highlighting the need for robust prognostic tools. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1068 adult SIMD patients from the MIMIC-IV database, of whom 236 (22.1%) died within 28 days of ICU discharge. Candidate predictors were screened using Boruta, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV). Eight machine learning algorithms were developed and compared. Model performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, confusion matrices, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics. Model interpretability was assessed with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: Seven independent predictors were identified: Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), cerebrovascular disease, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). Logistic regression achieved consistent discrimination, with AUC values of 0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.82) in the training set, 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) in the validation set, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.94) in the test set. Model accuracies were 70.0%, 67.0%, and 79.0%, respectively, with sensitivities ranging from 0.76-0.82 and specificities from 0.65-0.79. Negative predictive values (NPV) remained high (0.91-0.93), while positive predictive values (PPV) were moderate (0.38-0.52). The K-S statistic indicated strong discrimination (0.46, 0.45, and 0.52 across cohorts). SHAP analysis confirmed APS III ( approximately 0.11), age ( approximately 0.05), and ALP ( approximately 0.03) as the most influential predictors, with CCI ( approximately 0.02) and CK-MB ( approximately 0.01) contributing modest but clinically relevant effects. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a parsimonious logistic regression model with robust discrimination (AUC up to 0.88) and calibration (K-S > 0.45). The model underscores acute illness severity, aging, and hepatic dysfunction as principal determinants of short-term mortality in SIMD, offering valuable support for early risk stratification in critical care."
41389427,Development and multicenter validation of a machine learning model for postoperative sepsis risk in critically Ill traumatic spinal injury patients.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning model for postoperative sepsis in critically ill traumatic spinal injury (TSI) patients, a frequent and severe complication without dedicated predictive tools. METHODS: Model development used the MIMIC-IV 3.1 database, with external validation in the eICU-CRD 2.0 database and a Chinese TSI cohort. Variables documented within 24 h of postoperative ICU admission were screened using univariable testing and refined through Boruta and Group-Lasso regression to identify the final predictors. Thirteen base learners were trained and combined in a stacking ensemble optimized by fivefold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC), average precision from precision-recall (PR-AP), calibration, decision, and lift curves, along with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 scores. Interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis. RESULTS: The development cohort comprised 808 patients, with 461 (57.1 %) sepsis cases, and the external validation cohort consisted of 358 patients, with 86 (24.0 %) events. Twelve predictors entered modeling, with the stacking model achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.918 and PR-AP of 0.938 in training and 0.889 and 0.936 in validation, maintaining close calibration, superior clinical utility confirmed by decision and lift curves, and balanced classification metrics, while most first-level models deteriorated markedly. External validation confirmed consistent performance and effective high-risk stratification. SHAP analysis underscored surgical burden, severity, hemodynamic, renal, and coagulation domains as key contributors, ensuring interpretability at cohort and individual levels. CONCLUSION: This first validated model for postoperative sepsis in critically ill TSI patients shows relatively robust performance and interpretability, enabling early risk stratification and supporting clinical decision-making."
41385588,Blood RNA biomarkers and a point-of-care elastase assay for detecting host immune activation in suspected sepsis: Trajectory matters.,2025,"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: The chances of survival from sepsis are improved by early diagnosis and treatment. In the prospective SENSOR study, RNA biomarkers of innate immune neutrophil activation were examined in emergency department (ED) patients triggering an automated sepsis alert. We hypothesized that higher levels of blood RNA biomarkers related to neutrophil activation would be associated with progression to more severe forms of sepsis. METHODS: Adult patients in the ED triggering a sepsis alert were consented, enrolled, and study samples were obtained during the ED visit. Additionally, study samples were collected from a convenience sample of 16 adult non-ED controls and 8 other adults with self-described infectious illnesses. Blood samples were drawn in RNA preservative (Tempus) and whole blood RNA was analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for RNA transcripts related to neutrophil response to infection by bacterial (DEFA1; ALPL, IL8RB/CXCR2), and viral (IFI27, RSAD2) pathogens. Bacterial burden in blood was quantitated by ddPCR of 16S ribosomal DNA. Separately, neutrophil elastase was measured in immunomagnetically captured CD66b+ neutrophils by a novel point-of-care device. RESULTS: Patients were grouped using both 'Sepsis-2' SIRS criteria, adjudicated by independent physicians, and 'Sepsis-3' criteria which uses a qSOFA score for categorizing the severity of illness. Across 72 enrolled sepsis alert patients, 62.5% showed positive RNA biomarkers for bacterial infection, and 8.3% were positive for viral markers, with only 2 cases that showed only a viral signal. Septic patients showed a 4-fold increase in RNA markers vs. those without infection (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in RNA levels between those with sepsis vs those with more severe forms of sepsis. Likewise, RNA biomarker levels did not discriminate patients with qSOFA>/=2 from qSOFA = 1. In a subset of patients with zero and three hour blood samples (n = 27) it was found that changes in RNA levels (up or down), or neutrophil elastase activity, was strongly associated with progression to more severe forms of sepsis or a qSOFA score of >/=2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients progressing to more severe forms of sepsis did not have higher absolute levels of neutrophil activation RNA biomarkers (or higher bacterial burden in blood) compared to patients with sepsis. However, a change in RNA biomarkers or elastase between zero and three hours was strongly indicative of progression to more severe forms of sepsis."
41383948,The role of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in neuroinflammation.,2025,"Neuroinflammation, a key defense mechanism of the nervous system, is associated with changes in inflammatory markers and stimulation of neuroimmune cells such as microglia and astrocytes. Growing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota and its metabolites directly or indirectly regulate host health. According to recent studies, bacterial dysbiosis in the gut is closely linked to several central nervous system disorders that cause neuroinflammation, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and ischemic stroke. Recent findings indicate a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and central nervous system that influences neuroinflammation and cognitive function. Dysregulation of this system can affect the generation of cytotoxic metabolites, promote neuroinflammation, and impair cognition. This review explores the lesser-studied microbiota-derived metabolites involved in neuroinflammation-bile acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and indole derivatives-as targets for creating new treatment tools for neuroinflammatory illnesses, as well as possible biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis."
41380845,Prognosis of central venous catheter-related Candida infection during hospitalization in conventional medical or surgical wards: A 13-year retrospective cohort study.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: While catheter-related Candida infections in intensive care settings are well-described, data from conventional medical or surgical wards remain limited. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of catheter-related Candida infections in such settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study from 2008 to 2022, including patients with confirmed catheter-related Candida infection. Diagnosis was based on a positive central blood culture, along with either a positive peripheral blood culture, local inflammatory signs, or radiological signs suggesting catheter-related candidemia. The main outcome was either transfer to the intensive care unit or death within 30 days. RESULTS: Following a univariate analysis, 15 (30 %) patients among a total of 50 had an unfavorable outcome: eight (16 %) were transferred to the intensive care unit, and seven (14 %) died within 30 days. Poor outcome was associated with age over 60 years, clinical severity, and positive mannan biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Catheter-related Candida infections in non-critical care settings are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Fungal biomarkers may hold clinically relevant prognostic value, necessitating further investigations."
41380288,Prognostic value of suPAR in sepsis: a potential tool to support patient management in the Emergency Department.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: The soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a well-established biomarker of immune activation, reflecting the severity of systemic inflammation. Recent evidence showed increasing interest in suPAR as a prognostic marker, with elevated levels consistently associated with greater disease severity and mortality, in different clinical settings. METHODS: In this retrospective study, suPAR levels were assayed at Emergency Department admission in patients who received a diagnosis of sepsis or systemic infection during their initial clinical workup, using an automated turbidimetric assay (suPARnostic ViroGates kit on Atellica CH analyzer Siemens). The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the association between baseline suPAR levels and mortality, while the secondary endpoint aimed to explore their potential as indicators of clinical severity and predictors of patient outcomes. RESULTS: suPAR levels were elevated in all patients (median 6.99 mug/L) consistent with the severity of their clinical condition. A threshold of 10.2 mug/L was strongly associated with mortality, while a cut-off of 5.96 mug/L identified patients with severe disease and prolonged hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: suPAR seems to be a reliable, rapid, and clinically useful prognostic biomarker in the Emergency Department in patients with sepsis or systemic infections. Its early measurement by turbidimetric immunoassay in automation can support risk stratification, improve triage decisions, and enhance the management of these patients."
41380052,Grouping of Emergency Department-based Cardiac Arrest Patients According to Clinical Features to Assess Patient Outcomes.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: While research has begun to understand emergency department-based cardiac arrest (EDCA), consensus on what exactly constitutes EDCA remains unknown. In this study we aimed to explore the grouping of EDCA by using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm and to investigate how these underlying clusters related to patient outcomes. METHODS: We retrieved electronic health record data from an ED in a tertiary medical center. The EDCAs were identified via the cardiopulmonary resuscitation log. We used k-means cluster analysis to group EDCAs and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for visualization. Primary outcomes were ED mortality and ED length of stay (LOS). The analyses were repeated using an independent ED data set, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) dataset. RESULTS: From 2019 to 2022, there were 366 EDCA events. Cluster analysis identified three distinct clusters (Cluster 1 or immediate risk, n=54 [15%]; Cluster 2 or early risk, n=274 [75%]; Cluster 3 or late risk, n=38 [10%]). Cluster 1 patients had the shortest median time to EDCA (< 1 hour), followed by Cluster 2 (3 hours) and Cluster 3 (81 hours). Near cardiac arrest at triage was the most common cause of EDCA in Cluster 1, while respiratory illnesses and sepsis were more common in Cluster 3. The causes of EDCA in Cluster 2 were diverse, with predominantly cardiovascular and neurologic emergencies. The t-SNE revealed farther distances from Cluster 1 to the other two clusters, suggesting its most critical nature. Cluster 3 had the highest mortality (58%), followed by Clusters 1 (48%) and 2 (35%) (P = .01). Cluster 1 had the shortest median LOS (median, 4 hours), while Cluster 3 had the longest LOS (81 hours) (P < .001). In the independent data set, Cluster 1 remained, but Clusters 2 and 3 appeared to merge due to a shorter ED LOS overall. CONCLUSION: We identified three novel clusters (immediate, early, and late risk) with distinct patterns in clinical presentation, putative causes of ED-based cardiac arrest, and ED outcomes. Understanding these clinical phenotypes may help develop cluster-specific interventions to prevent EDCA or intervene most appropriately. Cluster 1 patients may benefit from resuscitation efforts, and Clusters 2 or 3 patients can benefit from timely interventions for cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic emergencies. In addition, for patients with prolonged ED boarding, periodic monitoring with an early warning system may prevent a cardiac arrest event."
41378273,"Pancreatitis Unveiled: Linking Pathogenesis, Organ Failure, and Emerging Predictive Biomarkers.",2025,"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition that starts as a mild illness but can progress to become fatal through multi-organ failure with high death rates. The APACHE II and BISAP scoring systems help identify patient risks, but their ability to forecast early deterioration remains limited during the initial hours following admission when critical decisions need to be made. This review examines the mechanisms linking pancreatic injury to systemic inflammation and organ failure, outlining the distinction between early sterile organ failure and later sepsis-related failure. Clinical patterns of organ dysfunction correlate strongly with the inflammatory response, and early indicators such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome duration, rising blood urea nitrogen, hemoconcentration, and increasing CRP provide useful predictors of disease severity. Emerging biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8, circulating histones, angiopoietin-2, arterial lactate, and albumin-based ratios, show promise for forecasting persistent organ failure. Integrating these markers with machine learning algorithms and multi-cytokine panels enhances predictive accuracy for patient risk assessment and early intensive care unit admission. Although promising, most of these biomarkers and AI-based tools remain investigational and require further multicenter validation. Future research should prioritize standardized assay methods and prospective evaluation of combined clinical-biomarker-AI models to determine their true impact on early diagnosis, triage, and patient outcomes."
41377779,"Febrile Rash, Shock, and Hyperferritinaemia in A Young Woman: Navigating the Diagnostic Overlap of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, Toxic Shock, and Viral Exanthema.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Fever, rash, and shock in adults pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Markedly elevated ferritin often raises suspicion for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), yet hyperferritinaemia is also encountered in sepsis, adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and viral infections. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman who developed a high fever, diffuse erythematous rash, hypotension, and markedly elevated ferritin levels. The initial differential diagnoses included toxic shock syndrome, HLH, AOSD, and viral exanthema. Extensive evaluations for infectious, autoimmune, and malignant diseases were negative. Imaging demonstrated gallstones with gallbladder wall inflammation, which was likely the trigger for the systemic inflammatory response. With supportive care and early multidisciplinary input, the patient made a full recovery without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of contextualising ferritin elevation and maintaining a broad differential diagnosis. Serial laboratory trends, careful use of HLH scoring systems, and multidisciplinary collaboration prevented premature immunosuppression and ensured a favourable outcome. LEARNING POINTS: Hyperferritinaemia is a useful biomarker but highly non-specific and must be interpreted within the broader clinical context.Serial trends in inflammatory markers and use of scoring tools such as the HScore guide safe decision-making in suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.Early multidisciplinary review helps prevent unnecessary immunosuppression and ensures timely supportive care."
41377546,Sepsis and the diverse organ-gastrointestinal tract axis.,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a dysregulated host immune response to infection that culminates in multi-organ dysfunction. Recent advances highlight the gut microbiota's pivotal role in modulating immune responses and influencing the pathophysiology of sepsis through the organ-gastrointestinal tract axis. This review synthesizes current evidence on the bidirectional interplay between gut dysbiosis and the dysfunction of major organ systems-liver, lungs, kidneys, brain, and heart-during sepsis. We explore how gut-derived factors such as microbial translocation, endotoxins, and altered metabolite production exacerbate systemic inflammation and organ injury. In particular, we emphasize the roles of short-chain fatty acids, uremic toxins, bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in mediating immune dysfunction across the gut-organ axes. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota- including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation- show promise in preclinical and early clinical settings. However, challenges related to patient heterogeneity, safety, and the lack of precise biomarkers persist. This review consolidates disparate findings to underscore the gut as a central modulator in sepsis and advocates for microbiota-based interventions as adjunctive therapies in sepsis management."
41377524,Retrospective evaluation of efficacy of CytoSorb((R)) therapy in septic shock patients in a tertiary care intensive care unit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytokines and inflammatory mediators are the key factors that are involved in the pathology of sepsis. Extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption devices offer an innovative clinical support system to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm associated with sepsis. AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of CytoSorb((R)) therapy as an adjunct to standard care in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed. Data were obtained for the patients who were treated with the CytoSorb((R)) adsorber for the past 5 years. The effects of therapy were assessed by changes in vasopressor requirements, specifically, norepinephrine and epinephrine. In addition, cytokine levels, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, as well as substances such as serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase were also evaluated. In addition, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ventilator requirements were also recorded. The survival outcomes were analyzed based on the length of patients' stay in the ICU, and the severity of illness was assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and Sepsis-associated Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores recorded at baseline and post-therapy. RESULTS: Following CytoSorb((R)) therapy, the requirement for vasopressor drugs, particularly norepinephrine, was reduced by 40% and a statistically significant improvement in MAP by 7.8%. Additionally, significant reductions were observed in IL-6 and serum lactate levels by 83% and 52% respectively. Around 56% had a delta lactate score of > 1.5, while 23% patients had a score ranging from 1 to < 1.5, and 16% patients had a score between 0.5 and < 1 and merely 5% patients had a score of </= 0.5. Besides, serum levels of creatinine, procalcitonin and CRP were significantly reduced by 17.2%, 41.5% and 53.8% respectively. There was a significant reduction in scores, including APACHE II [to 23 (18-29) from 27 (23-33)], and SOFA [to 12 (10-14) from 13 (11-15)]. Mechanical ventilation was required by 96% patients, with a median duration of 12 days, and the median length of hospital stay in overall patients was 26 days, while the median ICU stay was 18 days. CONCLUSION: CytoSorb((R)) therapy seems to be a promising adjunctive approach in the management of septic shock."
41376397,Utility of procalcitonin in diagnosing early postoperative sepsis after pediatric cardiac surgery in Malaysia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can interfere with analysis of routine clinical and biochemical parameters. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a potential biomarker for diagnosing early postoperative sepsis in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery utilizing CPB. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PCT compared to other biomarkers, especially C-reactive protein (CRP), in this clinical setting. METHODS: A prospective single-center study was conducted over a 10-month period during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2021-2022), enrolling 89 pediatric patients postcardiac surgery. PCT, CRP, and complete blood count were analyzed, and area under the curve (AUC) was employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: PCT and CRP demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability with AUCs of 0.678 and 0.635, respectively. White cell count exhibited fair discriminatory power, and platelet count performed poorly in distinguishing septic from nonseptic cases (AUC: white cell count, 0.545; platelet, 0.486). CONCLUSIONS: PCT and CRP hold promise as diagnostic markers for early postoperative sepsis in pediatric cardiac surgery patients. However, these biomarkers are not adequate standalone indicators, emphasizing the continued need for clinical judgment supported by multiple diagnostic parameters."
41375849,"Time to Decompression in Obstructive Urosepsis from Ureteral Calculi: Thresholds, Initial Diversion, and Early Biomarkers: A Systematic Review.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Obstructive urosepsis mandates rapid source control, yet actionable time-to-decompression (TTD) thresholds and the influence of diversion route remain debated. This review synthesized evidence on TTD, early outcomes, and predictive biomarkers. Methods: Following PRISMA-2020, ten studies met eligibility: three large administrative cohorts and seven clinical series/trials comparing outcomes by TTD and/or initial decompression (retrograde stent [RUS] vs. percutaneous nephrostomy [PCN]) and reporting biomarkers. Results: Delays were consistently harmful. In a national cohort, a TTD of >/= 2 days increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63). Another analysis showed mortality of 0.16% with </=48 h vs. 0.47% when delayed (derived OR, 0.43; p = 0.044). Absence of decompression yielded the highest mortality (19.2% vs. 8.82%; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.7). Septic shock remained frequent despite low crude mortality in clinical series: 20.8% and 33.3% across two cohorts. Post-decompression urosepsis occurred in 18.7% in a randomized study and was associated with pyonephrosis and higher procalcitonin (PCT). An ED cohort showed that earlier stenting reduced length of stay (</=6 h: 35.6 h vs. 71.6 h, p = 0.01; </=10 h: 45.7 h vs. 82.4 h, p = 0.04). Modality effects were modest; one cohort reported higher ICU use with PCN vs. RUS (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.24-8.41), likely reflecting confounding by indication. Conclusions: Across designs, timeliness-not device choice-was the dominant determinant of early outcomes. Biomarkers (notably, PCT) and imaging features can prioritize ultra-early decompression."
41373794,Fatal Myocarditis Following Adjuvant Immunotherapy: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2025,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by enhancing the immune response against tumors. However, they can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including rare but potentially fatal myocarditis. We describe a 71-year-old man with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab who developed severe ICI-associated myocarditis. Despite early diagnosis, treatment with intensive immunosuppression and mechanical support, he suffered fatal cardiac complications. A systematic review of the literature up to May 2025 identified 44 cases of ICI-associated myocarditis. Data on clinical features, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Most cases involved older patients with lung cancer treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Onset varied from days to years after therapy initiation. Presentations included dyspnea, chest pain, arrhythmias, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The biopsy showed T-cell and macrophage infiltration. High-dose corticosteroids were the primary treatment; additional immunosuppressants were used in cases that were refractory. Mortality was 45%, mainly due to cardiac failure and sepsis. Discussion: ICI-associated myocarditis arises from immune dysregulation affecting cardiac tissue, potentially involving shared antigens and systemic inflammation. Early detection and aggressive immunosuppression are crucial but often insufficient, resulting in high mortality. This underscores the urgent need for a better understanding of pathogenesis and the development of effective management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Finally, a multidisciplinary approach is important to improve outcomes in ICI-associated myocarditis."
41373009,Machine learning predicts non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Non-thyroid disease syndrome (NTIS) occurs in various serious illnesses, with sepsis being a common cause. Early identification of NTIS risk in sepsis patients is crucial. This study aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models for the NTIS occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 963 recruited sepsis patients, and 890 of them were retained for NTIS occurrence prediction after data selection and processing, while 797 NTIS patients were selected for mortality prediction. LASSO regression and correlation analysis identified key clinical features. We evaluated the predictive capacity on both occurrence and mortality of eight machine learning algorithms using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Sensitivity and Specificity. For mortality prediction, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors and construct a nomogram model, which was further validated by decision curve and survival analyses. RESULTS: XGBoost performed best in NTIS occurrence prediction, while LASSO showed the highest efficiency for mortality prediction. Lower levels of T3, FT3, T4, and KAP/LAM were associated with higher NTIS risk. Mechanical ventilation, norepinephrine, abdominal infection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation with sudden cardiac arrest, multiple organ failure, novel coronavirus infection, and gender were associated with NTIS mortality. Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox regression underscored age, mechanical ventilation, pulmonary infection, multiple organ failure, norepinephrine, UA, and FIB as independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: XGBoost and LASSO models showed promising performance in predicting NTIS occurrence and mortality in sepsis patients, respectively, and integrating them with clinical risk factors may improve risk stratification and support clinical decision-making. However, the findings are derived from a single-center dataset, and the use of data imputation to address missing values may introduce model instability, warranting cautious interpretation and external validation."
41372998,MiR-143-5p serves as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with sepsis and regulates sepsis-induced inflammation and cardiac dysfunction.,2025,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) offer advantages in stability and therapeutic specificity. This study investigated the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of miR-143-5p in sepsis (SP) and SP-associated cardiac dysfunction (CD). ‌Methods. Quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) quantified serum and cellular miR-143-5p levels. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve evaluated miR-143-5p's diagnostic efficacy. Pearson correlation analysis assessed the association between miR-143-5p and SP. Univariate logistic regression identified CD risk factors, with multivariate logistic analysis including significant variables from univariate analysis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage (THP-1) and cardiomyocyte (AC16) models elucidated miR-143-5p mechanisms in SP, with bioinformatics predicting the potential pathways. ‌Results. MiR-143-5p downregulation demonstrated diagnostic value for SP (AUC: 0.897) and SP-CD (AUC: 0.812). MiR-143-5p expression correlated (P < 0.0001) with white blood cell count (WBC, r = -0.680), C-reactive protein (CRP, r = -0.563), procalcitonin (PCT, r = - 0.693), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, r = 0.640), cardiac troponin I (cTnI, r = -0.599), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II, r = -0.695), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA, P < 0.05) scores. MiR-143-5p served as a risk factor for CD in SP (OR: 0.100). MiR-143-5p overexpression reduced M1 polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated THP-1. In AC16 cardiomyocytes, it enhanced viability, suppressed apoptosis, and attenuated inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis indicated miR-143-5p was involved in p53 and MAPK signal pathways regulation. ‌Conclusions. MiR-143-5p downregulation showed diagnostic potential for SP and SP with CD, correlating with disease severity and CD risk. Mechanistically, miR-143-5p overexpression mitigated macrophage and cardiomyocyte injury."
41372900,Sepsis mortality prediction using machine learning and deep learning - a systematic review.,2025,"Sepsis, a critical infection-induced inflammatory condition, poses substantial global health challenges, demanding timely detection for effective intervention.

41370337,Protective Effects of TRPV1 Agonist Capsaicin in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Rats.,2025,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels have been shown to be present in many tissues, including the kidney. Previous studies have reported that TRPV1 activation has anti-inflammatory and renoprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPV1 agonist capsaicin on acute kidney injury (AKI) in a rat sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Rats were divided into control, CLP and treatment groups in which 3 different doses of capsaicin (2, 6 and 30 mg/kg) were administered with CLP administration. Kidney tissues and sera from animals 24 h after CLP were analyzed. Histopathological examinations have shown that kidney damage occurs due to sepsis. TLR4/NF-kappaB activity, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), caspase-3, caspase-8 and malondialdehyde levels increased in renal tissue due to sepsis. Serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and renal damage biomarkers (BUN, CRE, IL-18 and NGAL) increased due to sepsis. Capsaicin administration dose-dependently reversed sepsis-induced pathological changes in the kidney and serum. Our findings suggest that the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin has renoprotective effects in sepsis-induced AKI by reducing inflammation, oxidative damage and apoptosis. TRPV1 activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate sepsis-induced kidney and other organ damage."
41369115,From glycemic variability to digital signal biomarker: a prognostic and precision medicine framework for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"Sepsis, a condition with substantial global morbidity and mortality, frequently leads to sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). While glycemic variability (GV) correlates with adverse outcomes in critically ill populations, its prognostic value in SA-AKI remains underexplored. Using the MIMIC-IV database, this large-scale machine learning cohort study examined SA-AKI patients. Restricted cubic spline, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between GV, measured by glycemic coefficient of variation (CV) and 28- and 90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, and diabetes status were performed. Prognostic models were developed using Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random survival forests (RSF). Among 12,268 eligible SA-AKI patients, the Boruta algorithm identified glycemic CV as a key prognostic determinant. When stratified by CV quartiles, higher CV quartiles exhibited significantly increased 28-day and 90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses revealed consistent associations except in diabetic patients, where increases in CV showed no correlation with mortality. Machine learning models exhibited strong predictive performance, with 28-day area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.822 (CoxPH), 0.822 (LASSO), and 0.845 (RSF), and 90-day AUCs of 0.819 (CoxPH), 0.820 (LASSO), and 0.837 (RSF). Elevated GV is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality in SA-AKI. Beyond prognostication, these findings position GV as a real-time, modifiable digital biomarker that may underpin a mechanistic Glycemic Oscillation-Induced Renal Injury (GO-RI) Axis. This framework supports future development of machine learning-enabled precision ICU nephrology strategies for dynamic risk stratification and phenotype-specific glycemic modulation in SA-AKI."
41368629,DAMP-driven trained immunity: metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in critical illness and chronic inflammation.,2025,"Innate immune memory, traditionally underappreciated in contrast to adaptive immunity, is now recognized as a critical component of host defense, particularly in the context of sepsis and sterile inflammatory injury. Recent advances have identified a central role for metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in driving trained immunity (TRIM), where monocytes, macrophages, and other innate cells develop enhanced or tolerized responses to secondary stimuli. This review synthesizes current knowledge of how damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including oxidized LDL, HMGB1, heme, urate crystals, and mitochondrial DNA, serve as potent inducers of immunometabolic rewiring, often through the mTOR/HIF-1alpha axis or alternative pathways such as SYK signaling. We highlight distinct epigenetic mechanisms, such as enhancer priming via H3K4me1/H3K27ac, and metabolic shifts like the Warburg effect, succinate accumulation, and fatty acid synthesis, that define the trained or tolerized states. Particular attention is given to the relevance of these mechanisms in the pathophysiology of sepsis, burns, trauma, and other critical illnesses where persistent DAMP exposure may sustain maladaptive inflammation or immunosuppression. We review data linking central (stem cell-level) and peripheral reprogramming to long-term immune dysfunction in various inflammatory disease models, and explore how DAMPs intersect with PAMPs to shape the immune trajectory. Finally, we identify pressing gaps in the field, including the need for standardized TRIM models, validated biomarkers of innate memory, and mechanistic clarity on mitochondrial DAMPs in immune tolerance. These insights provide a foundation for future therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating trained immunity to improve outcomes in critically ill patients."
41368432,An interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of Escherichia coli infection in ICU patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early and accurate identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients remains challenging butmay improve clinical outcomes if addressed effectively. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of E. coli infection at ICU admission. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Adult patients (aged 18-100 years) with their first ICU admission and a length of stay >/=24 hours were included. E. coli infection was identified based on microbiological results and diagnostic codes. Missing data were imputed using the missForest algorithm. Feature selection was performed with Boruta and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and intersecting variables were used for model construction. Eight machine learning models, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network, were developed. Model performance in the validation cohort was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC). Model interpretability was evaluated with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: A total of 52, 554 ICU patients were analyzed, of whom 4, 157 (7.9%) had E. coli infection. Twenty-eight intersecting variables were selected for modeling. Among all models, the SVM achieved the highest discrimination (AUC = 0.745, 95% CI: 0.726-0.764), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.742) and extreme gradient boosting (AUC = 0.739). Calibration and decision analyses indicated robust model calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified gender, age, sepsis, sedative use, and potassium level as the most influential predictors. A web-based tool was developed to enable real-time clinical risk estimation and individualized interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: An interpretable SVM-based machine learning model was developed and validated for early prediction of E. coli infection in ICU patients, demonstrating good discrimination, calibration, and potential clinical benefit. The associated online tool provides transparent, individualized risk predictions and may facilitate timely clinical decision-making."
41368240,The prognostic value of the neutrophil‑to‑platelet ratio for predicting postoperative sepsis complications after ureteroscopic lithotripsy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality following ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). Current diagnostic criteria, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, are effective for identifying established sepsis but often fail to provide early warning before clinical deterioration. This creates a critical need for readily available predictive biomarkers. Given that a rise in neutrophils and a fall in platelets are central to sepsis pathophysiology, neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR) represents a promising candidate for early risk stratification. This study aimed to evaluate the NPR for the early prediction of postoperative sepsis following URSL. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 674 patients undergoing URSL (January-December 2024). After screening, 385 patients were included and classified into sepsis (n=40) and control (n=345) groups based on postoperative urine culture and SOFA score. Biomarkers measured 3-hour postoperatively were analyzed using logistic regression. Diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified NPR, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and female gender as independent predictors of sepsis. Among these, NPR demonstrated the strongest association. The sepsis group exhibited a significantly higher NPR (0.081+/-0.051 vs. 0.020+/-0.013, P<0.01). NPR showed robust diagnostic efficacy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.838-0.955], sensitivity of 80.0%, and specificity of 88.4% at an optimal threshold of >2.77x10(-2). CONCLUSIONS: The NPR, obtained from a routine blood count 3-hour after URSL, is a strong independent predictor of subsequent sepsis, showing high diagnostic accuracy. These findings highlight its potential clinical utility for early risk stratification, pending validation in prospective multicenter cohorts."
41368117,Hypertransaminasemia in non-cirrhotic critically-ill patients.,2025,"Hypertransaminasemia - acute elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase - is prevalent in non-cirrhotic adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and often signals extra-hepatic pathophysiology rather than intrinsic liver disease. To synthesise contemporary evidence on aetiology-driven diagnosis, management and emerging biomarkers of hypertransaminasemia in critically ill patients. We performed a structured search of PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL (January 2010-June 2025). The search was restricted to full-text articles that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Hypoxic liver injury is the leading cause of hypertransaminasemia in non-cirrhotic ICU patients and is characterized by a >/= 50% alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase fall within 72 hours after haemodynamic stabilisation. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury remains uncommon yet explains about 13% of acute liver-failure cases in Western registries. Sepsis-associated liver injury presents mainly as conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with modest transaminase rise, whereas parenteral-nutrition-associated liver disease is dominated by cholestasis after > 2 weeks of parenteral feeding. Early optimisation of macro-/micro-circulation, rational deprescribing of hepatotoxins, rapid source control of infection and prompt transition to enteral nutrition are outcome-modifying interventions across all phenotypes. In the ICU, aminotransferase elevation should be interpreted as a dynamic biomarker of systemic distress. A pattern-recognition algorithm integrating clinical context, enzyme kinetics and novel biomarkers (glutamate dehydrogenase, microRNA-122, high-mobility group box-1) can expedite aetiology-specific therapy and deserves prospective validation."
41367529,Early predictive value of interleukin-6 and procalcitonin levels for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic respiratory complication in preterm infants. With the advancement of medical technology, the survival rate of many preterm infants with low gestational age (GA) has increased year by year, accompanied by a rising incidence of BPD. Currently, the pathogenesis of BPD is not fully understood, and there are no specific treatment methods. It is particularly important to make early predictions and take preventive measures for BPD. This study aimed to evaluate the early predictive value of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels for BPD in preterm infants. METHODS: In total, 114 preterm infants with GA <32 weeks were enrolled. Infants who met the diagnostic criteria for BPD were assigned to the BPD group (n=57), whereas those who did not meet the criteria formed the non-BPD group (n=57). The BPD group was further categorized based on severity: mild, moderate, and severe. General conditions, comorbidities, complications, treatment outcomes, and maternal data were compared between groups. Serum IL-6 and PCT levels were measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after birth. Multifactorial regression analysis was conducted to investigate postnatal risk factors, and a logistic regression model incorporating clinical factors and biomarkers was developed to predict BPD. RESULTS: Among the 57 infants with BPD, 32, 22, and 3 had mild, moderate, and severe BPD, respectively. Invasive ventilation >7 days and late-onset sepsis (LOS) were significant risk factors for BPD (P<0.05). Serum IL-6 and PCT levels were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on days 1 and 3 (P<0.05). The levels were also higher in the moderate/severe BPD groups than in the mild group (P<0.05). The area under the curve for IL-6 and PCT levels was higher on day 1 than on day 3. Moreover, the serum IL-6 levels were positively correlated with serum PCT levels in the BPD group on days 1 and 3. A BPD prediction model was constructed using four indicators (invasive ventilation >7 days, LOS, IL-6 and PCT on day 1), showing significant predictive value (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive model combining serum IL-6 and PCT levels with independent clinical risk factors could enable early BPD prediction."
41367239,Identification of novel PTP1B inhibitor for the treatment of LPS-induced myocardial apoptosis: machine learning based virtual screening and biological evaluation.,2025,"Sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction (SICD) poses a serious threat to human life. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) displays an essential role in SICD occurrence, so discovering novel inhibitors targeting PTP1B is an effective strategy for SICD treatment. In this research, we exploited a novel virtual screening pipeline consisting of both ligand-based and structure-based modules to find novel PTP1B inhibitors, and compound PI-2 with IC(50) = 4.1 +/- 0.3 muM was successfully discovered. Enzymatic and cellular thermal shift assay showed PI-2 displayed a moderate PTP1B inhibitory activity and a good selectivity towards both PTP1B and TCPTP. Besides, PI-2 effectively protected Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced AC16 injury by reducing cell ROS levels and enhancing mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, this research not only provides a novel virtual screening strategy for discovering novel PTP1B inhibitors, but also supplies a potential candidate for further optimisation for the treatment of SICD."
41366789,NUFIP1 at the crossroads of ribophagy and disease: unveiling therapeutic implications.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Nuclear FMR1-interacting protein 1 (NUFIP1), originally identified as a binding partner of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), has increasingly been recognized as a pivotal factor in various pathological processes. Its recently elucidated role as a receptor in ribophagy positions it at the intersection of critical cellular pathways, suggesting broad functional significance in human disease pathogenesis. This review synthesizes emerging evidence underscoring the multifaceted involvement of NUFIP1 in key physiological and pathological mechanisms. It regulates fundamental processes such as tumor metabolism, immune responses during sepsis, and recovery from neural injury. Notably, recent findings indicate that impaired NUFIP1 function, particularly within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, can be exacerbated by external factors like low-protein diets, leading to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and the promotion of necroptosis. This compilation critically evaluates the mechanistic contributions of NUFIP1 across these diverse disease contexts and assesses its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker. SHORT CONCLUSION: In conclusion, NUFIP1 emerges as a critical molecular player with widespread implications for human health. A comprehensive understanding of its functions provides valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review consolidates the current knowledge on NUFIP1, highlights its clinical relevance, and identifies promising avenues for future research to fully delineate its therapeutic potential."
41366523,Kinetics of molecular patterns captured by mannose-binding lectin in septic shock correlate with clinical outcome: a monocentric prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Various serum biomarkers and scoring systems are currently employed to manage septic critically ill patients. However, a paucity of biomarker evidence facilitates sepsis identification or prognosis. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is the main circulating protein in innate immunity. It acts as a broad-spectrum recognition molecule that binds most pathogens, along with their breakdown products and cell debris. We report results of an original approach dosing molecular patterns captured by FcMBL, an engineered version of MBL, in patients with septic shock. This study aimed at evaluating molecular patterns kinetics to assess their potential contribution to the clinical management of critically ill patients suffering from septic shock. RESULTS: This monocentric, prospective, observational study was conducted on adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock. Using magnetic microbeads coated with FcMBL, we quantified molecular patterns captured in blood and analyzed their kinetics for 5 days. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) levels were sampled at 6-h intervals over the first 24 h of ICU admission, then at 12 h intervals on Day 2, and then daily through Day 5. To align the data from the real time of admission to the ICU, the ""Serial Measurements"" module in MedCalc((R)) software enabled the incorporation of advanced methods, such as mixed models. Outcomes were the persistence of sepsis after Day 5 and adherence to routine sepsis metrics. Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. At Day 5, 21 patients had recovered from sepsis with a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score < 2, while 18 were not. The initial values of PAMP yielded a median concentration of 5 ng/mL. The peak concentration was observed at 9 ng/mL, with a median delay of 24 h. Significant differences were observed in kinetic curves according to the SOFA score at Day 5, with a notable delay in time to peak (Tmax) for the prolonged sepsis group (Hour 48) compared to the short-term sepsis group (Hour 18) (p < 0.001). Compared to standard biomarkers, Tmax PAMP was the most discriminative factor for an unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular pattern levels captured by FcMBL during septic shock exhibited large inter-patient variability, suggesting values depend on numerous parameters. The signal's kinetics demonstrated predictive value and may contribute to clinical management.

41366293,T cell immunometabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: T lymphocyte dysfunction is closely associated with immunosuppression in sepsis, whereas the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. RESULTS: In this study, we established a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and observed immunometabolic alterations in splenic T cells. Serum energy metabolites related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were imbalanced. Splenic T cells from septic mice showed a shift in subset distribution, with decreased naive T cells and increased effector populations, along with concurrent activation and exhaustion phenotypes. Notably, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly diminished in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell, correlated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression. Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed mitochondrial morphological alterations in CLP-derived CD3(+) T cells. Furthermore, seahorse assays demonstrated impaired metabolic reprogramming capacity in activated CLP splenic CD3(+) T cells, with suppressed glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation responses. This impairment was coupled with reduced fold-increases in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential levels upon activation in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell compared to controls. Clinically, peripheral T cells from septic patients showed elevated CD69 and PD-1 expression, a significant increase in CD39 and a decrease in CD73, increased mitochondrial mass and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, particularly in those with septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide several layers of T cell dysfunction in sepsis, linking subset redistribution, an exhausted phenotype, mitochondrial impairment, and reduced proliferative capacity, suggesting that future therapeutic interventions aiming to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression may require a combinatorial approach."
41363878,Antimicrobial stewardship in critical care.,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the most significant threats to global health, largely driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. This review outlines the current principles and practices of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in the context of critical care. We address the global burden of AMR, the development of resistance and the implementation of AMS strategies from multidisciplinary, diagnostic and pharmacokinetic perspectives. The use of rapid diagnostics, biomarkers such as procalcitonin, and the integration of electronic health records are discussed as enablers of targeted therapy and improved outcomes. Special populations, such as transplant recipients and critically ill patients with sepsis, are examined in the context of AMS, with attention to therapy optimization and resistance prevention. Challenges in implementation - especially in low-resource settings - are addressed, highlighting the need for global cooperation and infrastructure investment. Through evidence-based strategies, stewardship programs aim to enhance antimicrobial efficacy, minimize resistance development, and improve patient outcomes. This review advocates for the responsible use of antimicrobials across all care settings and emphasizes the necessity of continuous education, surveillance and adaptation in AMS policy and practice."
41363715,Low Diastolic Blood Pressure and Risk of Ischemic Colitis in the Women's Health Initiative Cohort.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: To identify risk and protective factors in older women for incidence of ischemic colitis (IC) and 30-day mortality. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 100,825 women in the Women's Health Initiative, with an average of 13.1-year follow-up and extensive phenotypic and outcomes data in diverse race and ethnic groups. Lasso Cox regression selected variables related to incidence of IC from multiple domains (demographic, comorbidities, risk factors, biomarkers, psychosocial factors, and dietary factors). Cox regressions modelled the selected variables to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rate of IC was twice as high among those with a history of cardiovascular disease (55.7 per 10,000 person-years) compared with those with no such history (27.3 per 10,000 person-years). After adjustment for multiple covariates, higher risk was associated with diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, using 2 or more types of antihypertensive medications compared with none (aHR 1.62, 95% CI 1.47-1.78), having gastrointestinal symptoms (aHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.42 highest vs lowest quartile). Higher fiber intake was associated with lower risk (aHR per increase of 10 g/d 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97), and Black women had lower adjusted risk of IC than White women (aHR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.83). Post-IC 30-day all-cause mortality was 10.6%, and sepsis was an important cause of death. DISCUSSION: The incidence rate of IC in older women was twice as high in those with a history of cardiovascular disease and was associated with low diastolic blood pressure and multiclass antihypertensive treatment. Dietary fiber intake was associated with lower risk. Black women had lower risk of IC compared with White women."
41360904,Impact of meningoencephalitis and sepsis on delirium and subsequent neurological impairment in pediatric patients: a prospective proof-of-concept biomarker and EEG study.,2025,"To assess the incidence and severity of delirium and subsequent neurological impairment in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients with meningoencephalitis (ME) and sepsis. Prospective study enrolling PICU patients with sepsis or meningoencephalitis (ME) and healthy controls. Daily delirium assessment, repeated electroencephalography, blood sampling at days 1, 3, 5 and lumbar puncture, if clinically indicated, for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling were performed. Biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, PCT, IL-6), endothelial activation (NT-proCNP), neurodegeneration (NSE, tau), neuroaxonal damage (NfL, NfH, UCHL-1) and glial injury (GFAP, S100B) were measured. Neurological status was assessed using the Functional Status Scale (FSS), the pediatric overall performance category (POPC) and the pediatric cerebral performance scale (PCPC) before admission and after three months. Twenty-four PICU patients (ME n = 9, sepsis n = 15) and eleven controls were enrolled. The delirium incidence was not statistically higher in patients with sepsis (60%, n = 9/15) compared to ME (33%, n = 3/9, p = 0.105). Children with delirium (n = 12) had a higher FSS (10.0 [9.8, 12.0] vs. 7.5 [7.0, 9.0], p = 0.009) at day 1 than children without delirium (n = 12), without significant differences in blood and CSF biomarker levels. Patients with ME presented higher levels of blood NfL compared to sepsis patients at day 3 (16.8 [12.9, 77.5] vs. 10.7 [8.6, 12.2] pg/ml, p = 0.011) and day 5 (16.2 [6.8, 170.4] vs. 12.0 [7.9, 14.3] pg/ml, p = 0.005). Routine EEG results did not differ between the groups, but quantitative EEG parameters representing encephalopathy correlated with biomarkers of brain injury. FSS, POPC and PCPC after three months were identical between in all patients. Independent from the origin of inflammatory stimulation by sepsis or ME delirium is associated with transient neurological dysfunction in PICU patients, without neurological impairment after three months, as confirmed by biomarker levels."
41360226,Targeting the DYNLL2-PAK1 axis inhibits caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis to alleviate sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host responses to infection, lacks effective therapeutic strategies due to its complex immune pathophysiology. Here, we identify Dynein Light Chain LC8-Type 2 (DYNLL2) as a critical risk gene driving sepsis progression through bioinformatics and machine learning analysis of clinical datasets. Elevated DYNLL2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and monocyte expansion in sepsis patients. Mechanistically, DYNLL2 interacts with p21-Activated Kinase 1 (PAK1) to regulate the endocytosis of Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), facilitating cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release and subsequent Caspase-11 inflammasome activation, thereby triggering pyroptosis. Depletion of DYNLL2 or PAK1 suppresses OMV internalization, Caspase-11/Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, and proinflammatory cytokine release without affecting bacterial clearance. Virtual screening identifies Oroxylin A, a flavonoid compound, as a potent inhibitor of the DYNLL2-PAK1 interaction. In vitro, Oroxylin A blocks Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis by reducing cytosolic LPS levels. In murine endotoxemia models, Oroxylin A improves survival, mitigates multi-organ damage, and suppresses systemic inflammation. Our findings reveal the DYNLL2-PAK1 axis as a pivotal regulator of sepsis pathogenesis and propose Oroxylin A as a promising therapeutic candidate to disrupt pyroptosis and restore immune homeostasis in sepsis."
41360218,Clinical value of neutrophil extracellular trap-related biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction in older patients: A case-control study.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical utility of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-related biomarkers as potential diagnostic and prognostic indicators for sepsis in older patients. METHODS: 39 sepsis older patients (age > 60 years) diagnosed and 28 older patients suffering from infections between August 2024 and April 2025 were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood plasma was collected to measure NET-related biomarkers, including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) complex, and nucleosomes. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Patients with sepsis exhibited significantly higher levels of dsDNA, citH3, MPO-DNA, and nucleosomes compared to controls. Non-surviving patients with sepsis had notably elevated dsDNA levels compared to survivors. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association between NET-related biomarkers, neutrophil counts, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that dsDNA was a reliable diagnostic marker for sepsis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.92, P < 0.001) and mortality prediction (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.75-0.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: NET-related biomarkers, particularly dsDNA and MPO-DNA, are significantly elevated in sepsis older patients and are independently associated with an increased risk of sepsis."
41359645,Molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities driving sepsis and atrial fibrillation: A Systematic study based on bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and atrial fibrillation are complex, life-threatening medical conditions affecting approximately 49 million individuals globally, characterized by exceptionally high mortality rates. Lipid metabolism abnormalities play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: This innovative study systematically investigates the shared molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities in sepsis and atrial fibrillation using advanced bioinformatics and machine learning methodologies. Methods: We retrieved two independent research cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus database: sepsis-related datasets and atrial fibrillation-related datasets. A multi-dimensional analytical approach was employed, including differential expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, machine learning models, immune cell infiltration analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis to comprehensively elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism abnormalities in these diseases. RESULTS: Comprehensive analysis identified 13 key candidate genes, with CD81, CKAP4, and DPEP2 emerging as core characteristic genes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed these genes primarily participate in mitochondrial function regulation, complement-coagulation cascade, and cell adhesion molecular pathways. Machine learning models demonstrated exceptional diagnostic performance, with area under the curve values of 0.957 for sepsis and 1.000 for atrial fibrillation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis unveiled the critical roles of neutrophils and monocytes in disease progression, and revealed the profound impact of lipid metabolism abnormalities on immune regulation. CONCLUSION: We discovered that lipid metabolism abnormalities significantly modulate disease progression by influencing mitochondrial function, inflammatory responses, and cell adhesion pathways. Future research necessitates further clinical validation and functional experiments to explore personalized therapeutic strategies based on lipid reprogramming."
41359607,Lactate dehydrogenase is an indicator for outcomes of short-term and long-term in septic patients.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and clinical outcomes in sepsis was explored based on MIMIC-IV database. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Models including unadjusted model and adjusted models were performed for exploring the association of LDH with 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality. The smooth fitting curves were constructed by using generalized additive model. The predictive value of LDH for clinical outcomes in sepsis was evaluated. The statistical software of EmpowerStats (http://www. empowerstats. com) and R (http://www.R-project.org) were applied for analysis. RESULTS: 6775 sepsis patients were included. After adjusted for all potential confounders, for every 100 IU/L increment in LDH, the risk of 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality increased by 11% (odds ratio (OR)=1.11, 95%CI:1.08-1.13, P < 0.0001) and 12% (OR=1.12, 95%CI:1.09-1.14, P < 0.0001), respectively. The areas under the ROC curve of LDH for predicting mortalities of 30-day and 1-year were 0.667 (95%CI:0.652-0.681) and 0.646 (95%CI: 0.632-0.660), respectively. CONCLUSION: LDH was positively correlated with 30-day and 1-year mortalities in sepsis and the relationship was nonlinear."
41359203,"Think sepsis, write sepsis, code sepsis - patient characteristics associated with sepsis (under-)coding in administrative health data.",2026,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, yet its documentation and coding in administrative health data remain unreliable. Accurate coding is essential for epidemiological surveillance, quality assurance, and reimbursement. This study aims to identify patient characteristics associated with under-diagnosis and under-coding of sepsis in German inpatient administrative health data (IAHD). METHODS: This secondary analysis of the multicenter OPTIMISE study included 10,334 hospital cases from ten German hospitals (2015-2017). Sepsis cases were identified via structured chart review and compared to ICD-coded diagnoses. Logistic regression and classification tree analyses were used to determine predictors of under-diagnosis and under-coding, including ICU admission, organ dysfunction, and infection source. RESULTS: Among 1,310 cases fulfilling severe sepsis-1 criteria, only 30.7% were correctly coded. The strongest predictor for coding accuracy was explicit mention of sepsis in the medical chart (OR 19.58). ICU treatment, organ dysfunction severity, and mechanical ventilation were also associated with higher coding rates, while pneumonia as the infection source was linked to a lower probability of sepsis being named and coded. CONCLUSION: Sepsis coding in administrative data is frequently inaccurate. Explicit naming of sepsis and severity markers strongly influence correct coding. As Germany introduces mandatory sepsis quality assurance in 2026, targeted interventions - including enhanced clinician documentation and electronic coding support - are essential to improve coding reliability and patient care."
41357996,Low NAPR as a Novel Indicator for Predicting Escherichia coli Bloodstream Infection and Improved Prognostic Outcomes in Elderly Hospitalized Inpatients: A 12-years Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with significant mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (E.coli) is the most common causative organism in BSIs, but non-E.coli BSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Predictive biomarkers including the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPAR) have not been well studied in elderly hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to compare the mortality in patients with E.coli and non-E.coli BSIs and, evaluate NPAR as a potential predictive biomarker for E.coli infection in extremely elderly inpatients. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted, involving 510 elderly patients diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Patients were divided into two groups based on the pathogen responsible for the infection: E.coli (n=92) and non-E.coli (n=418). Clinical data, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters were systematically collected. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess mortality risk, adjusting for relevant confounding variables. The predictive value of NPAR for E.coli bloodstream infection was analyzed via odds ratios (OR) and trend tests. Microbiological analysis of blood samples was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocols. RESULTS: Non-E.coli BSIs was associated with greater mortality compared to E.coli BSI; hazard ratio (HR)=0.43 (95% CI=0.21, 0.88; P=0.021). NPAR was a significant predictor of E.coli BSI; for continuous NPAR, the odds of E.coli BSI decreased by 12% per unit increase in NPAR (OR=0.88; 95% CI=0.84, 0.93; P<0.001). The odds ratio of the lowest tertile of NPAR versus rest was 0.21 (95% CI=0.11, 0.40, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-E.coli BSIs are associated with greater mortality in elderly patients, while low NPAR is strongly associated with E.coli BSI. These findings suggest that NPAR may be useful for early risk stratification and clinical management of elderly patients with BSIs."
41357484,Prognostic utility of procalcitonin and lactate clearance for in-hospital mortality in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a significant global health burden and a leading cause of in-hospital mortality. Recent research has focused on the prognostic value of biomarker kinetics, particularly clearance rates and inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio. This study aimed to compare the utility of procalcitonin and lactate clearance in predicting in-hospital mortality among septic patients and to identify an optimal procalcitonin clearance (PCTc) cut-off to differentiate survivors from non-survivors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented with sepsis or septic shock to a tertiary care ED in Lebanon between November 2018 and March 2024. Procalcitonin and lactate readings were recorded along with demographics, comorbidities and therapeutic interventions. PCTc and lactate clearance were calculated as percentage change between the first and second readings, and lactate clearance was considered positive if > 10%. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included ED, ICU and hospital length of stay. ROC curve was used to assess prognostic accuracy of biomarkers and derive an optimal PCTc cutoff. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the association of in-hospital mortality with lactate and procalcitonin clearances. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-four patients with sepsis and septic shock were included. Mean age was 71.4 +/- 16.5 years with male predominance (55.4%). Optimal cutoff for PCTc was found to be 23.1% (94.0% sensitivity, 7.0% specificity). Patients were then stratified based on lactate and procalcitonin clearances above and below the cutoffs to compare baseline parameters, interventions and outcomes. Patients with lactate clearance > 10 had significantly lower rates of chronic kidney disease (p = 0.006), congestive heart failure (p = 0.02), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.04). Only CRP showed a statistically significant difference with respect to PCTc. Therapeutic interventions were similar in both PCTc groups and lactate clearance groups except for 24-h IV fluid administration (p = 0.04). Mortality was significantly associated with lactate clearance > 10 (p = 0.045) but not with PCTc (p = 0.65). The area under the ROC curve was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.34-0.45, p = 0.56) for lactate clearance, 0.39 (95% CI: 0.33-0.45, p = 0.56) for PCTc and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.46-0.56, p = 0.67) for NLR, with a significant difference among the AUCs (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a borderline significant association of in-hospital mortality with lactate clearance (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.42-1.04, p = 0.07) but not with procalcitonin clearance (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.43-2.95, p = 0.81). Vasopressor use was associated with reduced odds of death, while steroid use was independently associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Lactate clearance with 10% cutoff is a better predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the ED with sepsis or septic shock compared to PCTc. An optimal PCTc cutoff of 23.1% was identified; however, it did not reach statistical significance for survival. Future prospective studies are needed to better define optimal biomarker cutoffs and compare their predictive accuracy for in-hospital mortality."
41357433,Transforming critical care: the digital revolution's impact on intensive care units.,2025,"Intensive care units (ICUs) represent a critical pillar of modern healthcare, combining advanced technologies and specialized care to support organ functions in critically ill patients. The recent COVID pandemic served not only as a stress test but also as a potential catalyst for further ICU digitalization advancements. Recently evolved tools and processes suggest a transformative potential for digitalization in enhancing ICU performance, optimizing resource utilization, and improving patient outcomes. Digital tools-particularly machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-could significantly support ICU care by facilitating real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and semiautomated decision-making. ML models have shown promise in outperforming traditional scoring systems when predicting patient outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay, and readmission risks. The digitalization of nursing documentation and resource allocation processes appears to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and potentially optimize staff time for direct patient care. Innovations in infection control are increasingly leveraging AI to predict conditions like ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis, enabling earlier interventions and potentially enhancing antimicrobial stewardship. Closed-loop ventilation systems illustrate a shift toward intelligent, data-responsive care platforms that may improve patient safety and therapeutic precision by embedding adaptive decision-making into medical devices. The pandemic underscored the growing relevance of ICU digitalization, accelerating the development of tools such as remote monitoring, tele-ICU models, and wearable devices. These advancements have helped address unprecedented patient volumes and further illustrated the potential of AI-enabled tools to streamline ICU workflows and augment patient care. This momentum reflects a broader paradigm shift in critical care toward more proactive, algorithm-assisted medicine-where AI is positioned to complement clinical judgment in managing the complexity of ICU environments. In addition, personalized digital recovery pathways are being explored to support post-ICU rehabilitation, although significant challenges remain in addressing patients' physical and psychological recovery needs. Altogether, these recent evolutions underscore the potentially transforming role of digitalization in enhancing ICU care quality and safety parameters, improving resource utilization, supporting better patient outcomes, and helping meet the evolving expectations of patients and their families."
41357343,Personalized Fluid Management in Patients With Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury: A Casual Machine Learning Approach.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: IV fluids are the cornerstone for management of acute kidney injury (AKI) after sepsis but can cause fluid overload. A restrictive fluid strategy may benefit some patients; however, identifying them is challenging. Novel causal machine learning (ML) techniques can estimate heterogenous treatment effects (HTEs) of IV fluids among these patients. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a causal-ML framework to identify patients who benefit from restrictive fluids (< 500 mL fluids within 24 hr after AKI). DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective study among patients with sepsis who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) within 48 hours of ICU admission. We developed a causal-ML approach to estimate individualized treatment effects and guide fluid therapy. We developed the model in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and externally validated it in Salzburg Intensive Care database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our primary outcome was early AKI reversal at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included sustained AKI reversal and major adverse kidney events by 30 days (MAKE30). Model performance to identify HTE of restrictive IV fluids was assessed using the area under the targeting operator characteristic curve (AUTOC), which quantifies how well a model captures HTE, and compared with a random forest model. RESULTS: Causal forest model outperformed random forest in identifying HTE of restrictive IV fluids with AUTOC 0.15 vs. -0.02 in external validation cohort. Among 1931 patients in external validation cohort, the model recommended restrictive fluids for 68.9%. Among these, patients who received restrictive fluids demonstrated significantly higher rates of early AKI reversal (53.9% vs. 33.2%, p < 0.001), sustained AKI reversal (34.2% vs. 18.0%, p < 0.001), and lower rates of MAKE30 (17.1% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.003). Results were consistent in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Causal-ML framework outperformed random forest model in identifying patients with AKI and sepsis who benefit from restrictive fluid therapy. This provides a data-driven approach for personalized fluid management and merits prospective evaluation in clinical trials."
41357328,Shorter or biomarker-guided antibiotic durations for common serious neonatal infections: a collection of non-inferiority meta-analyses.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary antibiotic prolongation promotes antimicrobial resistance. Evidence-based guidance on antibiotic durations for treating neonatal infections is lacking. Noninferiority meta-analyses evaluating shorter durations or biomarker-guided durations have not been conducted. METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses using a unified search strategy (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, January 1990-December 2024) to determine whether short-course antibiotics are noninferior to ""standard"" courses for culture-positive sepsis, culture-negative sepsis, UTIs, uncomplicated/complicated meningitis, and fungal sepsis. Likewise, we determined whether biomarker-guided antibiotic durations are noninferior to ""standard"" courses for any sepsis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without language restriction comparing short-courses or biomarker-guided courses versus standard courses for treating the above neonatal infections. Minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for critical outcomes were pre-specified [mortality (28-day, in-hospital or 12-month corrected age) = +1%, culture-positive relapse = +3%, culture-negative relapse = +5%]. We evaluated risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0) and certainty of evidence (CoE) using GRADE. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023311895. FINDINGS: We reviewed 146 full-text articles and included 26 in the review. For culture-positive sepsis (7 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), 7-10-day courses were noninferior to longer courses for 28-day mortality [upper bound of 95% CI for risk difference +0.85%, below 1% MCID (low CoE)], in-hospital mortality [+0.51% (moderate CoE)], culture-positive relapse [+0.75%, below 3% MCID (low CoE)], culture-negative relapse [+4.7%, below 5% MCID (very low CoE)]. For culture-negative and -positive sepsis, biomarker-guided courses (5 RCTs) were noninferior to standard courses for mortality and relapses (all very low CoE). For culture-negative sepsis (6 RCTs), shorter courses (3-4 days) were noninferior for culture-positive relapses (very low CoE) but not noninferior for other outcomes (low to very low CoE). Conclusions could not be drawn for UTI (6 observational studies) or meningitis (1 RCT). There were no data for complicated meningitis and fungal sepsis. INTERPRETATION: Compared to standard durations, 7-10-day antibiotic courses and biomarker-guided courses may be noninferior for treating culture-positive neonatal sepsis and any sepsis, respectively. Three-to-four-day courses may not be noninferior for culture-negative sepsis. Given the low to very low CoE, these conclusions are not definitive. No conclusions can be drawn for UTIs, meningitis, and fungal sepsis. FUNDING: Not funded."
41356799,"Aggregation-induced emission of DNA fluorescence as a novel pan-marker of cell death, senescence and sepsis in vitro and in vivo.",2026,"Background and Aim: Effective monitoring of cell death and senescence is critical across biology and medicine, yet a universal in situ fluorescent marker has remained elusive. This study aimed to identify and characterize a novel, endogenous optical signal arising from cellular stress and to evaluate its potential as a universal, label-free biomarker for visualizing cellular fate in diverse physiological and pathological contexts. Material and Methods: Autofluorescence was characterized in human cell lines, C. elegans, a mouse sepsis model, and human plasma samples using two-photon and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The molecular origin of the signal was investigated through lysosome isolation, high-throughput DNA sequencing, gel electrophoresis, and photophysical experiments with synthetic nucleic acid oligonucleotides. The underlying routes to lysosomal accumulation were probed using shRNA-mediated knockdown and dominant-negative protein expression. Results: We discovered that cytosolic DNA fragments, sequestered into lysosomes via ESCRT-mediated microautophagy, aggregate and exhibit strong aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with a distinct peak at ~600 nm. This signal originates from excimer formation in single-stranded DNA, with mitochondrial DNA being a primary source during cell death. This label-free fluorescence allowed for the differentiation of cell death types in vitro and its intensity correlated with the progression of aging in C. elegans and sepsis in both mice and a human pilot study. Conclusions: Aggregated nucleic acids within lysosomes represent a novel, universal, and label-free endogenous biomarker for cell death and senescence. This AIE-based optical signal provides a powerful tool for real-time in situ visualization and dynamic tracking of cellular fate, holding significant potential for applications in basic research, diagnostics, and therapeutic monitoring."
41356079,Muscle matters: Transforming the care of intensive care unit acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis.,2025,"Intensive care unit (ICU) acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis are increasingly recognized complications of critical illness, characterized by a rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and function. These conditions result from a complex interplay of systemic inflammation, immobilization, catabolic stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often culminating in impaired recovery, prolonged hospitalization, and increased long-term mortality. First identified in survivors of sepsis and prolonged mechanical ventilation, these muscle abnormalities were initially described using computed tomography-based assessments of muscle area and density. Subsequent advances in imaging, biomarker discovery, and functional testing have enabled earlier detection and risk stratification across diverse ICU populations. While nutritional optimization and early mobilization form the cornerstone of current prevention and treatment strategies, the emergence of novel approaches, including automated artificial intelligence-based screening, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and targeted pharmacologic therapies, has broadened the clinical scope of interventions. Despite their significant prognostic implications, ICU-acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis remain under-recognized in routine critical care practice. This mini-review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding their pathophysiology, available diagnostic modalities, prognostic relevance, and the evolving landscape of therapeutic strategies for long-term functional recovery in critically ill patients."
41353904,Prediction of weaning in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients using interpretable machine learning methods.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Weaning from mechanical ventilation remains a critical challenge in intensive care units. Machine learning has shown potential in supporting clinical decisions during this process. OBJECTIVE: Sepsis frequently leads to ALI/ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation. However, with evolving definitions of weaning, many existing predictive models have become outdated. This study aimed to develop a predictive model based on the standardized WIND framework to accurately predict successful weaning in septic patients under current clinical practices. METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV database were analyzed. Univariate analysis identified risk factors for extubation outcomes, and feature selection was performed using LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Predictive models, including XGB, RF, and GBM, were evaluated based on AUC and F1 score. SHAP values were used to assess feature importance. RESULTS: A total of 3774 patients were included. Univariate analysis showed that the failed weaning group had longer ICU stays, higher ventilator settings, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, creatinine, SOFA scores, lactate, and platelet count (P < 0.05). Feature selection reduced 46 variables to 12 key predictors. The XGB model performed best, with AUC values of 0.849, 0.838, and 0.825 for the training, internal, and external cohorts, respectively. SHAP analysis identified mean airway pressure, ICU length of stay, and lactate as the most influential predictors. CONCLUSION: We developed an interpretable, accurate XGB-based model to predict weaning outcomes in septic patients."
41353678,CMKLR1 as a Therapeutic Target: Vitamin D-Mediated Suppression of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in SA-AKI.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe complication of sepsis, primarily driven by immune-inflammatory dysregulation and oxidative stress, and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) shows renoprotective potential, yet its molecular targets and mechanisms remain unclear. Transcriptomic data of SA-AKI from GEO were analyzed by ssGSEA for immune infiltration, differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning (LASSO, SVM-RFE, Random Forest) to identify the biomarkers. In vivo, SA-AKI was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3,) and renal function, histology, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and CMKLR1 expression were evaluated. In vitro, LPS-stimulated HK-2 cells were treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) with or without CMKLR1 overexpression to assess cytokines, cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Four key biomarkers-CMKLR1, COL1A1, RPS19, and THBS1-were identified by machine learning, with CMKLR1 as the key target. In SA-AKI mice, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) downregulated CMKLR1, improved renal function, and reduced inflammation and oxidative stress. In LPS-stimulated HK-2 cells, it dose-dependently suppressed cytokine release, restored cell viability, and alleviated oxidative stress, while CMKLR1 overexpression partially reversed these effects. CMKLR1 was identified as a key immune inflammation target in SA-AKI. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was protected against renal injury by suppressing CMKLR1, and mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, while CMKLR1 overexpression partially reversed these effects. These findings highlight CMKLR1 as a potential therapeutic target for SA-AKI."
41353590,Validating pancreatic stone protein for early sepsis detection and outcome prediction in community acquired infections: evidence from a tertiary medical centre.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) plasma levels has been proven effective in predicting unfavourable outcomes in patients with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), infection after cardiothoracic surgery and peritonitis. It is also being studied as a sepsis biomarker with promising results compared to other commonly used biomarkers. We aim to validate PSP in septic patients with community acquired infections. This will help to establish its role in point-of-care settings. METHODS: Adult patients consecutively admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary medical centre, with the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection (IAI), urinary tract infection (UTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. PSP was measured in whole blood, within one hour since admission, by spectrophotometry using abioSCOPE device. Statistical analysis was performed, and a cut-off value for PSP to predict the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need for invasive treatment was estimated. Patients were followed for 28 days to document their outcomes. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and one (n = 101) patients were included. Forty-five were male. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (33%). Fifty-three (52.5%) had LRTI, thirty-seven (36.6%) had UTI and nineteen (18.8%) had IAI. Thirteen of them had more than one type of infection. Our primary outcome met statistical significance, as PSP predicted the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need of invasive treatment with an Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.844 (95% CI 0.767-0.920), in the optimal cut-off of 48.5 ng/ml. PSP predicted sepsis with an AUC = 0.892 (95% CI 0.826-0.956) and was also an independent risk factor for sepsis and mortality after age adjustment. PSP was superior to the common used sepsis biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogonase (LDH)/albumin ratio, White Blood Cell count (WBC), fibrinogen and lactate both for sepsis and for the composite outcome. It was also correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) day 1 (D1), SOFA peak and qSOFA and its prognostic value was independent of renal function, despite being inversely proportional to estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), reflecting the sepsis-related acute kidney injury (SAKI). CONCLUSIONS: PSP is a valuable biomarker that can rule out patients who do not have sepsis and are not in high risk to develop sepsis the following days, giving valuable insights regarding their antimicrobial coverage and management in general. It seems to be superior to other biomarkers in sepsis prediction and adequately compatible with frequently used sepsis assessment scores, such as SOFA. In the Emergency Department setting PSP can distinguish infected patients at high risk for sepsis who have low qSOFA scores."
41351215,"Association between FAR, PAR, APRI and adverse neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by intrahepatic cholestasis.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR), platelet/albumin ratio (PAR), and AST/platelet ratio (APRI) in identifying poor neonatal outcomes among pregnancies complicated by IHCP. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study included 165 pregnant women diagnosed with IHCP and 155 healthy pregnant women matched for age and gestational age, who delivered at a tertiary care hospital between January 2023 and January 2025. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and perinatal characteristics were reviewed. FAR, PAR, and APRI were calculated from standard laboratory data. A composite poor neonatal outcome was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: Apgar score <7 at 5 min, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), meconium aspiration, neonatal sepsis, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: FAR and APRI values were significantly higher in the IHCP group compared to controls (p<0.05). Among neonates with adverse outcomes, only FAR levels were significantly elevated (p = 0.015). However, its discriminative ability was limited (AUC = 0.607; sensitivity: 58 %, specificity: 63 %) and it was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: FAR and APRI levels are elevated in pregnancies with IHCP, yet FAR alone demonstrates limited predictive value for adverse neonatal outcomes. It may serve as a supportive, rather than standalone, marker. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted."
41350624,Identification of sepsis pyroptosis-related genes based on single-cell sequencing technology and experimental verification.,2025,"This study aimed to screen for new biomarkers for sepsis. Firstly, peripheral blood samples from 23 sepsis patients and 10 healthy volunteers were collected according to the sepsis 3.0 criteria and analyzed by RNA-seq. A total of 876 pyroptosis-related genes were sourced from the Genecards database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was then employed to pinpoint genes linked to sepsis clinical modules significantly associated with the phenotype. An intersection analysis with pyroptosis-related genes was conducted, resulting in the identification of 60 common genes. Then, two core genes (BCL6 and JAK2) were jointly identified using three types of machine learning: random forest, SVM, and Lasso regression. Expression analysis showed that both were significantly highly expressed in the sepsis group, and the subject work characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that their diagnostic efficacies were high in both of them in the multiple datasets (AUC value > 0.88), and meta-analysis revealed their correlation with the prognostic status of sepsis patients, and GSEA analysis showed that BCL6 was mainly enriched in metabolism-related pathways, while JAK2 was significantly involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, immune infiltration analysis showed that BCL6 and JAK2 were closely associated with the infiltration of a variety of immune cells, suggesting their potential functions in regulating the immune microenvironment. Finally, single-cell sequencing localization showed that BCL6 and JAK2 were mainly distributed in macrophages and B cells. Mendelian Randomization Analysis Suggests BCL6, JAK2 Expression Levels May Influence the Risk of Sepsis. The experimental results verified the expression status of key genes. Clinical trial number for this study: ChiCTR1900021261 Registration date: February 4, 2019. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12865-025-00785-6."
41348679,Red blood cell to platelet ratio and its trajectory as prognostic factors for patients with gastrointestinal tract perforation and abdominal sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis after emergency gastrointestinal perforation surgery increases costs and hospital stay. Early diagnosis and management are vital. This study assesses the prognostic value of the red blood cell to platelet ratio (RPR) in these patients with abdominal sepsis. METHOD: Clinical data from MIMIC-IV and a hospital validation set were retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, comorbidities, and lab indices were extracted; missing values were imputed using random forest. RPR's dynamic changes and relation to prognosis were analyzed using latent category trajectory modeling. Prognostic factors were screened via Lasso-Cox regression to build column-line graph models. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests, and restricted cubic splines analyzed RPR-outcome associations. R 4.2.3 was used; P < 0.05 was significant. RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were enrolled in MIMIC-IV and 253 patients were enrolled in the hospital. RPR was a significant prognostic indicator. Elevated RPR correlated with coagulation dysfunction (increased PT/INR, decreased fibrinogen) and higher mortality risk. Trajectory analysis identified two RPR patterns; Class 1 had significantly lower 28-day mortality than Class 2. The hospitalization and ICU prognostic models demonstrated good efficacy. Validation set results supported these findings, indicating dynamic RPR changes effectively assess prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The red blood cell to platelet ratio may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for abdominal septic patients, influencing clotting and kidney function."
41348239,Molecular analysis of immune cell subsets and cytokine profiles in septic Vietnamese patients.,2025,"Sepsis remains a Major global health burden, accounting for an estimated 11 million deaths annually, and is characterized by a profoundly dysregulated host immune response to infection. Despite its significant morbidity and mortality, the immunopathogenesis of sepsis-particularly within underrepresented populations-remains inadequately understood. Here we report distinct immunological signatures associated with clinical outcomes among Vietnamese septic patients. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive investigation of both cellular and cytokine immune parameters in the sepsis population. Our findings demonstrate that survivors of sepsis exhibited a higher proportion of circulating B cells, whereas non-survivors showed increased activation of T and natural killer (NK) cells, marked by elevated expression of activation molecules such as CD69 and GITR. There was a notable reduction in B cell numbers, and further phenotypic analysis revealed signs of B cell exhaustion, indicated by increased CD21low expression, as well as depletion of both memory and naive B cell subsets. Collectively, these results establish compromised humoral immunity in septic patients. T cells in septic patients displayed a skewing toward effector memory phenotypes, and NK cells demonstrated impaired cytotoxic potential, as evidenced by decreased expression of key the key activating receptors including NKG2D and DNAM-1. Concurrent cytokine profiling revealed significantly elevated concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in septic patients. A significantly diminished percentage of CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CD197(-) T cells, alongside markedly elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, was observed in non-survivors, strongly supporting their role as key prognostic biomarkers for predicting sepsis-related mortality. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels did not significantly differ between those who survived and those who did not, a result that diverges from some prior reports and highlights the possibility of population-specific immunological nuances."
41348160,Artificial Intelligence-Based Predictive Modeling for Early Detection of Sepsis in Hospitalized Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review evaluates artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models developed for early sepsis detection in adult hospitalized patients. It explores model types, input features, validation strategies, performance metrics, clinical integration, and implementation challenges. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL for studies published between January 2015 and March 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included those developing or validating AI models for adult inpatient sepsis prediction using electronic health record data and reporting at least one performance metric (area under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, or F1 score). Studies focusing on pediatric populations, lacking quantitative evaluation, or unpublished in peer-reviewed journals were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction followed preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Extracted variables included study design, patient population, model type, input features, validation approach, and performance outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most used retrospective designs, with limited prospective or real-time clinical validation. Commonly used algorithms included random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, and deep learning architectures (long short-term memory, convolutional neural network). Input data varied from structured sources (vital signs, laboratory values, demographics) to unstructured clinical notes processed via natural language processing. Reported AUC values ranged from 0.79 to 0.96, indicating strong predictive performance across models. CONCLUSIONS: AI models demonstrate significant promise for early sepsis detection, outperforming conventional scoring systems in many cases. However, generalizability, interpretability, and clinical implementation remain major challenges. Future research should emphasize externally validated, explainable, and scalable AI solutions integrated into real-time clinical workflows."
41347097,Proposed observational study protocol for early differentiation of cytokine release syndrome and sepsis in CAR-T recipients with haematological malignancies using the IL-6/PCT ratio: the DRACARYS study.,2025,"Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionised treatment for haematological malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in B-cell leukaemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. However, severe toxicities-particularly Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and sepsis-present significant clinical challenges. Both conditions share overlapping features, including fever, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction, making timely and accurate differentiation essential. CRS is driven by excessive cytokine release, predominantly IL-6, and is treated with IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab) and corticosteroids. Sepsis, by contrast, results from a dysregulated immune response to infection and requires antibiotics, as well as supportive care. Due to diagnostic uncertainty, clinicians often treat both conditions empirically. This can lead to inappropriate therapies-immunosuppressives may worsen sepsis, while antibiotics in CRS contribute to antimicrobial resistance and unnecessary healthcare burden. Existing biomarkers, such as IFN-gamma and IL-1beta, have shown potential but are limited by cost, availability, and the lack of rapid bedside implementation. There is a pressing need for a clinically accessible and reliable biomarker to distinguish CRS from sepsis in CAR-T patients. We hypothesise that the IL-6/procalcitonin (PCT) ratio will improve diagnostic accuracy. IL-6 is elevated in both conditions, while PCT is more specific to bacterial infection. However, PCT alone may be unreliable in immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving CAR-T therapy. The IL-6/PCT ratio is expected to reduce inter-individual variability and address limitations inherent to each marker when used alone. In this multi-centre, observational, prospective study, we will evaluate the IL-6/PCT ratio in febrile CAR-T patients. The primary analysis will focus on relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, with a prespecified expansion/validation across other CAR-T indications. Clinical adjudication will serve as the standard of reference. We will assess diagnostic performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cutoffs. This study, titled DRACARYS (Differentiating Reactions-CRS versus sepsis-After CAR-Ts), aims to enhance diagnostic precision, guide timely and appropriate treatment, and reduce complications and unnecessary healthcare utilisation in CAR-T recipients."
41346599,Neutrophil dysregulation differentiates pediatric septic shock biomarker-based mortality-risk strata: insights from weighted gene co-expression network and transcriptomic analyses.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality, particularly among children, with limited therapeutic options beyond antibiotics and organ support. The Pediatric Sepsis Biomarker Risk Model (PERSEVERE-II) stratifies mortality risk in pediatric septic shock, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying high mortality risk remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We analyzed whole blood transcriptomes collected from 81 children with septic shock on day 1 of meeting study criteria. Patients were stratified into high- and low-mortality risk groups according to the PERSEVERE-II biomarker risk model. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analyses, we identified molecular pathways and transcription factors (TFs) associated with mortality risk. Cell type differences were inferred using CIBERSORTx and using a reference single-cell dataset inclusive of neutrophils and their subsets. FINDINGS: We identified distinct molecular profiles with high-risk patients displaying significant overexpression of genes related to neutrophil degranulation and innate immunity, alongside suppressed adaptive immune responses. The predominance of developing neutrophils underscored a major role of emergency granulopoiesis. Key TFs identified, including LTF, FOXM1, KLF1, and CEBPB, were linked to high-risk gene expression signatures. Our findings indicate a pathological shift toward a dysregulated neutrophil-driven hyperinflammation and adaptive immune suppressive state, which together are associated with adverse outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that neutrophil dysregulation underpins the high mortality risk conferred by the PERSEVERE-II model. The identified transcriptional regulators may provide potential targets to mitigate neutrophil dysregulation and improve outcomes among high-risk patients."
41346598,Plasma lipidomic signatures reveal age-associated patterns of septic shock risk and immune dysregulation in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with significant lipidomic disturbances, but age-associated lipidomic patterns remain poorly characterized. Given the links between aging, immune dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation, defining age-specific lipid profiles could improve sepsis risk assessment. This study investigates age-stratified lipidomic signatures in sepsis and identifies biomarkers for clinical severity. ​METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 62 sepsis patients (21 <65 years, 41 >/=65 years) and 40 healthy controls. Plasma lipidomics was performed via untargeted LC-MS/MS, identifying 1,277 lipid species across 38 subclasses. Principal component analysis (PCA) and consensus clustering were used to assess lipidomic differences and define patient subtypes. Correlations between lipid subclasses, clinical severity (SOFA scores), and immune cell subsets were analyzed. An age-adjusted risk stratification model was developed to assess septic shock and mortality risk (AUC analysis). ​RESULTS: Sepsis patients exhibited reduced phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl ester (CE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels (all P<0.05). Clustering revealed four lipidomic patterns, with Cluster 4 distinguishing two sepsis subtypes (C1, C2). Subtype C2 had higher septic shock incidence (57.1% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.0013) and downregulation of 92 lipids, 35 of which strongly correlated with SOFA scores. A risk stratification model incorporating six key lipids (LPC(19:0), PC(P-19:0), SM 32:3;2O(FA 16:3), PC(P-20:0), PC(O-18:1/20:3), CE(15:0)) and age accurately predicted septic shock (AUC: 0.87 training, 0.82 validation) and mortality risk in elderly patients. PC levels correlated with monocytes, while CE and LPC associated with complement proteins and CD8+ T cells. ​CONCLUSIONS: Our lipid-based model effectively predicts septic shock and mortality, particularly in elderly sepsis patients. Age-associated lipid alterations (PC, LPC, CE reduction) correlate with disease severity and immune dysregulation, suggesting distinct lipid-immune mechanisms in younger vs. elderly patients. These findings support lipidomics as a tool for sepsis risk stratification and personalized therapy."
41345921,Development of a predictive model for septic shock-associated acute skin failure using readily available clinical variables.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute skin failure (ASF) is an understudied complication in patients with septic shock, and existing predictive models lack disease-specific variables. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations in patients with septic shock and to identify potential biomarkers and predictive factors for cutaneous deterioration. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed 154 adult patients with septic shock, defined according to the Sepsis 3.0 criteria, who were admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) between September 2020 and September 2022. Based on cutaneous manifestations observed during hospitalisation, the patients were stratified into two groups: the ASF group and the non-ASF group. Clinical characteristics, therapeutic interventions and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Significant univariate predictors were included in multivariable logistic regression. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 154 patients with septic shock, among whom 49 developed ASF, yielding an incidence rate of 31.8%. In the multivariate analysis, four independent predictors were identified: maximum norepinephrine (NE) dose (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, p = 0.051), NE duration (OR = 1.19, p = 0.054), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) (OR = 0.97, p = 0.042) and absence of oedema (OR = 0.18, p = 0.008). The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.730-0.876) with 72.3% sensitivity and 72.4% specificity at the optimal cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: The validated prediction model identifies patients with septic shock who are at high risk for ASF using four readily available clinical parameters: maximum NE dose, NE duration, ScvO(2) and absence of oedema, helping clinicians provide early warning and thereby reduce associated skin complications. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41344576,Protein post-translational modifications in sepsis: Molecular mechanisms and biomarkers.,2026,"Sepsis is a common and highly fatal condition in intensive care units and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. As a clinically complex syndrome with intricate pathophysiology, early identification and assessment of sepsis remain challenging. Deeper insights at the molecular level are crucial for understanding the complex pathophysiological mechanisms, discovering new biomarkers, and improving prognosis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) refer to the attachment of specific chemical groups to amino acid side chains through covalent, enzymatic, or non-enzymatic means, greatly expanding protein diversity and playing critical roles in many cellular signaling pathways. Here, we elucidate the regulatory roles of PTMs in sepsis pathways and key proteins, including immune response, late-stage inflammatory mediators, cellular metabolic reprogramming, and endothelial injury. We also summarize the progress in research on PTM-related sepsis biomarkers, covering diagnosis, prognosis, and organ dysfunction assessment, with a particular focus on the potential of glycosylation as a biomarker. Furthermore, we review current methodologies for studying PTMs. Continued focus on PTMs will pave the way for new possibilities in sepsis research and treatment."
41344135,TREM-1: A potential prognostic marker in newborns with late-onset sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS) continues to be a complex task, highlighting the need for continued research to discover reliable biomarkers that can improve both diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation. This experimental prospective cohort study aimed to assess the potential of TREM-1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for LOS. METHODS: This study included 121 newborns (NBs) distributed as follows: 84 blood samples from NBs with LOS, categorized into Gram-negative sepsis, Gram-positive sepsis, and culture-negative sepsis groups, along with 37 infection-free controls. sTREM-1 levels were measured using an immunoenzymatic assay on samples collected at diagnosis and on days 3 and 7 afterward, while TREM1 gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR on the day of diagnosis. RESULTS: Despite not being a significant diagnostic tool, the univariate logistic regression indicated that high sTREM-1 levels were strongly associated with septic shock, in addition to thermal instability and male sex. The adjusted multivariate analysis confirmed that elevated sTREM-1 levels (OR = 3.85, p = 0.032), and male sex (OR = 5.67, p = 0.016) were significantly associated with septic shock. Gene expression analysis revealed reduced TREM1 gene expression in infected neonates relative to controls; however, patients who died showed significantly higher expression levels (p < 0.001), indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: sTREM-1 showed good accuracy as a predictor of severity in LOS. TREM1 high expression was associated with a worse prognosis in septic neonates. However, additional studies involving a larger number of individuals are necessary to validate the clinical utility of this biomarker in practice."
41343415,Prognostic value of laboratory markers and clinical scores for mortality in intensive care unit patients with sepsis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, especially for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), where early identification of the prognosis is critical. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of inflammatory markers, clinical scores, and specific laboratory findings for predicting ICU and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the ICU of a university hospital between September 2019 and December 2022. To minimize selection bias, all eligible patients during the study period were consecutively included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and included demographics, clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, and clinical scores such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). The primary outcomes were ICU and in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 213 ICU patients with sepsis were included in the study. The patients were 62.0% male with a mean age of 73.1 +/- 12.6 years. The ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 29.6% and 36.6%, respectively. Non-survivors had higher clinical severity scores and poorer nutritional and perfusion profiles than survivors. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated lactate levels (a marker of tissue hypoperfusion) and higher SAPS 3 scores were independently associated with ICU mortality. For in-hospital mortality, lower albumin levels and higher SAPS 3 scores were significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: High lactate and SAPS 3 scores were independent predictors of mortality, while higher albumin levels showed a potential protective effect. Early identification of these factors may aid in the management of sepsis."
41341126,Comparison of the predictive value of different non-insulin-based insulin resistance indices for acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), but the preferred surrogate markers of IR have not been validated in patients with sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of triglyceride glucose index (TyG), metabolic score for IR (METS-IR) and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) for the development of AKI in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The cohort was divided into based on the tertiles of the surrogate indices of IR and Kaplan-Meier curve was depicted the outcomes of each group. Correlations of these three surrogate markers of IR with sepsis-associated AKI and stage III AKI were evaluated through Cox regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS). RESULTS: Of the 997 septic patients enrolled in this study, 748 patients (75.03%) developed AKI and 286 (28.69%) eventually progressed to stage III AKI. Cox regression models and RCS showed that only METS-IR was significantly correlated with the development of AKI and stage III AKI in patients with sepsis in a non-linear positive manner. Subgroup analysis showed that the correlation between METS-IR and AKI was not remarkable in patients with heart failure (P = 0.925), chronic kidney disease (P = 0.284), and diabetes (P = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: The current study compared the three accepted surrogate indices of IR and the results suggested that METS-IR may prove to be an ideal risk stratification tool for sepsis-associated AKI, showing a non-linear positive correlation."
41341033,Predicting tigecycline-related adverse events in infected patients: a machine learning approach with clinical interpretability.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Tigecycline (TGC), while effective against multidrug-resistant infections, is limited by hepatotoxicity and coagulation disorders, yet lacks robust predictive tools. METHODS: We developed an online dynamic nomogram to assess these adverse events using retrospective data from 2,553 TGC-treated patients (2020-2025). Seventy-seven clinical features were analyzed using Boruta and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for feature selection. Seven machine learning (ML) models were evaluated via ten-fold cross-validation, as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curves, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis for interpretability and an online dynamic nomogram for clinical translation. RESULTS: Logistic regression (LR) outperformed other algorithms, achieving Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.727-0.874) for hepatotoxicity and 0.755 (95% CI: 0.665-0.845) for coagulation dysfunction. Independent risk factors for liver injury included prolonged treatment duration, high dosage, ICU admission, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and elevated baseline levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Risk factors for coagulation dysfunction included extended treatment duration, ICU admission, elevated baseline creatinine (Cr), sepsis, and septic shock. Notably, co-administration of meloxicillin and higher baseline red blood cell (RBC) levels appeared to be protective. CONCLUSION: This study constructed an online dynamic nomogram with good discrimination and calibration, which can help to identify high-risk patients and assist clinicians in early risk stratification and individualized treatment planning."
41339821,Diagnostic performance of procalcitonin and presepsin in sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical emergency condition characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated response to infection. In the fast-paced emergency department (ED) setting, rapid identification and prompt initiation of treatment within the initial hours following sepsis onset are critical for reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. However, a timely and accurate diagnosis remains a significant challenge in emergency medicine. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin (P-SEP) have been proposed as tools to distinguish sepsis from other non-infectious inflammatory conditions frequently encountered in the ED, though their diagnostic effectiveness remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PCT and P-SEP for diagnosis patients with sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Scopus databases up to April 1st, 2024 and updated on June 30th, 2025. Studies reporting sensitivity and specificity of PCT and P-SEP for sepsis detection among patients in acute and emergency settings were included. Hierarchical modeling techniques were utilized to pool data for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirty-eight observational studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivities and specificities for detecting sepsis using PCT were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82), respectively. Similarly, for P-SEP, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.83), respectively. No statistically significant differences were identified between PCT and P-SEP regarding sensitivity (p = 0.169) or specificity (p = 0.792). The summary receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87) for PCT and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90) for P-SEP. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCT and P-SEP represent reliable biomarkers for early and accurate sepsis detection in acute and ED settings, demonstrating comparable diagnostic performance. Their integration into routine ED assessment protocols may support timely clinical decision-making and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies."
41339723,Biomarker studies to predict outcomes of patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome measured pre and post initiation of veno venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2025,"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) is a resource intensive and expensive therapy increasingly used to treat a select group of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). High levels of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) are reported to be predictive of mortality in non-COVID ARDS patients receiving ECMO. In this study we evaluated if levels of biomarkers including IL-10 can predict mortality if measured prior to ECMO initiation in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. A total of sixteen patients with COVID-related ARDS undergoing treatment with ECMO were included in the pre-ECMO biomarker analysis, while samples from a total of 22 patients with post-ECMO samples were analyzed. Nine of sixteen patients with pre-ECMO samples (56%) survived to hospital discharge. There was no difference in baseline demographics between survivors and non-survivors. In univariate analysis, survivors had no difference in IL-10 levels prior to ECMO initiation although we identified several other biomarkers (Ang 1 and TNF-alpha with logistical regression, Mitochondrial DNA and IP-10 with Kaplan-Meier analysis) that differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Moreover, as opposed to a prior study, area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed that IL-10 levels were not predictive of survival. We advise caution for utilizing a single biomarker as outcome predictor in this highly complex population with often long clinical courses despite our promising results."
41339488,Reforming disease prognosis and treatment prediction for palliative care with hybrid metaheuristic deep neural architectures in IoT healthcare ecosystems.,2025,"The increasing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare has led to massive, high-dimensional data streams, demanding advanced, adaptive learning models for timely and accurate clinical predictions, especially in sensitive domains such as palliative care. Existing models often suffer from high computational overhead, sensitivity to learning rate variations, and difficulties in handling non-stationary data, which impedes their ability to deliver accurate and prompt predictions in high-risk medical scenarios. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Hybrid Metaheuristic-Driven Deep Neural Architectures (HMDNA) that combines a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) for sepsis detection and prognosis. The methodology follows a structured pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and optimization. Time-series ICU data were preprocessed using k-NN imputation and min-max scaling, followed by DNN training with CSO-based optimization applied at initialization, mid-training, and fine-tuning stages. Implemented using TensorFlow and trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, the model achieved an accuracy of 92.7%, precision of 91.8%, recall of 90.3%, and F1 score of 91.4%. These results significantly outperform baseline models including traditional DNN (85.3% accuracy), DNN + GA (88.5%), DNN + PSO (89.2%), and DNN + ACO (90.1%). The proposed model demonstrated faster convergence, better generalization, and robustness to real-time variability in healthcare data. By combining the strengths of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization, this approach ensures reliable performance in dynamic and unpredictable clinical environments. The study highlights the potential of adaptive, hybrid AI models in enhancing healthcare decision-making, particularly in critical care scenarios where prediction accuracy and model responsiveness are vital for improving patient outcomes."
41338526,High Torque teno virus viremia predicts long-term mortality and reflects chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) in geriatric inpatients.,2026,"Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus whose viremia increases in conditions of immune dysfunction and aging, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker of immunosenescence. This study investigated the association between TTV viremia and all-cause mortality risk over seven years in a hospitalized older cohort, and its relationship with inflammatory markers including osteopontin (OPN) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Data from 956 patients were analyzed, with high TTV load defined as >/=5 log DNA copies/mL. High TTV viremia was significantly associated with increased mortality risk at 1, 3, and 7 years independently of age, sex, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers. In stratified analyses, this association was significant at one year in both males and females, but persisted at three and seven years only in males. The strongest association was observed in participants aged 80-89 years, remaining significant across all follow-up periods. When patients were stratified by a composite immune score reflecting degrees of immunosenescence, high TTV viremia predicted increased mortality among those with intermediate or severe immune dysfunction, persisting up to seven years in the most immunosenescent subgroup. Patients with elevated TTV loads exhibited increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), decreased serum albumin and hemoglobin, and significantly higher plasma levels of OPN and GDF15, whereas IL-10 tended to decrease. No significant differences were observed for neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, IL-6, CD163, CCL22, or CXCL9 between high and low TTV viremia groups. These findings indicate that high TTV viremia independently predicts mortality risk and reflects a pro-inflammatory and immunosenescent state."
41337457,Analysis of the cardiovascular response to standardized polymicrobial peritonitis experimental model.,2025,"The aim of this work is to study the response of pigs to an inflammatory insult, consisting of intraperitoneal instillation of autologous feces, by monitoring them from the induction of sepsis to the full development of septic shock. The response was measured not only with standard hemodynamic variables, like mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), but also with indices able to reflect vascular properties, such as the PP amplification, the Windkessel time constant tau, the harmonic distortion. Two distinct vascular responses to the insult up to the full development of septic shock, were identified, in an apparently homogeneous cohort. Indeed, the insult, the end point and the maneuvers were standardized according to factors that are typically used in sepsis trials. The results of the present study suggest that the cardiac response may play a greater role in one group of animals than in the other to compensate for a larger vascular alteration. However, further research is necessary to investigate the potential relationship between these trends and the administered therapy or inflammatory biomarkers.Clinical Relevance- These findings show how the response to an inflammatory response can produce different cardiovascular trends and this information can be used to guide the therapy."
41336559,Improving Machine Learning Models of Late-onset Sepsis Prediction Using Optimized Control Group Selection: A Comparative Study.,2025,"Late-onset sepsis (LOS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants due to their immature immune systems and the complex clinical environment of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Predictive models leveraging non-invasive vital sign data, such as heart rate variability (HRV), respiration and motion, have shown potential for early detection of LOS. However, the use of different control group selection strategies across LOS prediction studies, without any systematic comparison, has limited the potential to further improve the model performance. In this study, we evaluated three LOS prediction models trained using different control group selection strategies: 1) independent control, 2) intra-LOS control, and 3) a combined strategy. The training dataset included 128 preterm infants (60 LOS, 68 controls), while a independent test dataset of 49 patients (12 LOS, 37 non-LOS) was used for evaluation. The prediction performance of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) across varying prediction time windows. Our results showed that the combined strategy achieved the highest AUC (86.2%) within the 3-hour prediction window, outperforming the independent (70.9%) and intra-LOS (78.2%) strategies. While the independent strategy displayed the highest sensitivity and NPV, the intra-LOS approach offered better specificity and PPV. The combined strategy effectively integrated these strengths, offering superior predictive performance across key metrics. This study highlights the importance of control group selection in LOS model development and recommends the combined strategy as a promising approach for improving model performance.Clinical Relevance- This study highlights the impact of control group selection strategies on the predictive performance of LOS models, enhancing model generalizability in clinical LOS management."
41336241,Machine Learning-Based Adjudication of Acute Infection for Diagnostic Classifier Development with Silver-Standard Labels.,2025,"To produce training labels for diagnostic classifiers of acute infection for sepsis, an adjudication process involving manual chart review by one or more clinicians is current standard practice. This process is costly and varies from clinician to clinician. Acute infections can be difficult to definitively diagnose with resulting 'silver-standard' adjudications depending on clinician's subjective judgement. We leverage an international, multi-cohort dataset of multi-clinician-adjudicated acute infections to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based system for automated adjudication. We tested the performance and robustness to missing data of several off-the-shelf ML models in a benchmark study, tested the calibration of their output probabilities, and assessed what minimal set of features would be required to maintain performance in future studies. The resulting system, based on a logistic regression model, is accurate and well-calibrated enabling low-cost, reproducible and highly scalable adjudication of acute infection for downstream diagnostic classifier development.Clinical relevance-This work aims to automate the resource-intensive and variable process of chart review for adjudication of acute infection. Our approach makes adjudication of challenging, 'silver standard' acute infections reproducible and scalable to future studies, enabling more rapid, cost-effective incorporation of these studies in downstream development of diagnostic classifiers for sepsis. In addition, automating the chart review process could allow clinicians to spend more time on patient care."
41334935,Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantification of Proteins and Post-Translational Modifications in Dried Blood: Longitudinal Sampling of Patients With Sepsis in Tanzania.,2025,"The proteomic analysis of blood is routine for disease phenotyping and biomarker development. Blood is commonly separated into soluble and cellular fractions. However, this can introduce pre-analytical variability, and analysis of a single component (which is common) may ignore important pathophysiology. We have recently developed methods for the facile processing of dried blood for mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome, N-glycoproteome, and phosphoproteome. Here, we applied this approach to 38 patients in Tanzania who presented to the hospital with sepsis. Blood was collected on Mitra devices at presentation and 1, 3, and 28-42 days post-enrollment. Processing of 96 total samples was performed in plate-based formats and completed within 2 days. Approximately 2000 protein groups and 8000 post-translational modifications were quantified in 3 LC-MS/MS runs at  approximately 1.5 h per sample. Analysis of differential abundance revealed blood proteome signatures of acute phase response and neutrophilic inflammation that partially resolved at the 28-42 day timepoint. Numerous analytes correlated with clinical laboratory values for c-reactive protein and white blood cell counts, as well as the Universal Vital Assessment illness severity score. These datasets serve as proof-of-concept for large-scale MS-based (sub)phenotyping of disease using dried blood and are available via the ProteomeXchange consortium (PXD060377). SUMMARY: For the first time, we report the integrated quantitative analysis of proteins, N-glycopeptides, and phosphopeptides from dried blood specimens in a disease context. Sample collection on Mitra devices is easily incorporated into existing biobanking protocols and provides a convenient solution for sample storage and preparation for downstream mass spectrometry analysis. Signatures of sepsis are reflected in each of the analyzed proteomes and decline between presentation to the hospital and 1 month post. In addition to well-described markers, these analyses identify mediators of inflammation and innate immune signaling that would be missed in the more common analysis of cell-free plasma."
41334563,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Sepsis and Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction.,2025,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by infection, which can result in multiple organ dysfunctions, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute lung injury (ALI), ultimately leading to patient mortality. The pathophysiology of sepsis is intricate, involving excessive immune activation, cytokine storms, endothelial damage, and microcirculatory dysfunction. Dysregulated host responses frequently give rise to severe complications, markedly elevating mortality rates. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures consisting of DNA, histones, and granular proteins, released by neutrophils upon activation. Ongoing research into NETs has uncovered their significant pathophysiological roles in clinical conditions, including sepsis. This review outlines the mechanisms of NET formation, release, classification, detection methods, and relevant biomarkers. Additionally, it delves into the signaling pathways involved in NET generation, their pathophysiological implications in sepsis and its complications, and evaluates their potential utility in clinical laboratory diagnostics."
41334245,"Comprehensive assessment of endothelial dysfunction before cellular therapy: EASIX, local imaging, and systemic biomarkers.",2025,"Endothelial dysfunction contributes to mortality after cellular therapies, yet its clinical assessment remains challenging. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated 169 patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and 102 healthy controls to determine whether a comprehensive endothelial profile, including the endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX), glycocalyx thickness (via sublingual GlycoCheck microscopy), digital perfusion (Tivita hyperspectral imaging), endothelial serum markers (angiopoietin-2, soluble thrombomodulin [CD141], chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9, interleukin-18, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), and platelet aggregation (flow cytometry), correlates with clinical outcomes. We observed significant intercorrelations among EASIX, perfused boundary region (PBR), tissue perfusion, and endothelial serum markers. Importantly, elevated EASIX, angiopoietin-2, impaired PBR, and reduced digital perfusion were significantly associated with early sepsis, whereas EASIX also independently predicted nonrelapse mortality. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of endothelial responses to systemic insult and reinforce the need for multimodal assessment in a larger study. EASIX, as a simple and routinely available marker, emerges as a valuable tool to stratify endothelial risk and guide monitoring in patients undergoing cellular therapy. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT05502887."
41333476,Comprehensive analysis of metabolism-related genes in sepsis reveals metabolic-immune heterogeneity and highlights GYG1 as a potential therapeutic target.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host immune responses, yet the metabolic drivers of immune dysfunction remain poorly understood. METHODS: Here we systematically profiled metabolism-related genes (MRGs) in sepsis using bulk transcriptomic data and stratified patients into two subgroups with distinct immune infiltration profiles by MRGs, as assessed by CIBERSORT and single-cell RNA-seq integration. Machine learning identified five hub metabolic genes for constructing a metabolic risk score, whose prognostic relevance was robustly validated in an external cohort. Single cell analyses, cell-cell communication, and cell-type-specific differential expression analyses were performed to dissect the immunological context. Finally, in vivo validation was conducted using an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. RESULTS: Patients in the high metabolic risk group exhibited a neutrophil-dominant and lymphocyte-suppressed immune landscape, consistent across bulk and single-cell analyses. Among the five hub genes (ALPL, CYP1B1, GYG1, OLAH, VNN1), GYG1 demonstrated the strongest predictive performance and was highly expressed in monocytes, neutrophils, and proliferating myeloid cells. High-risk patients displayed intensified monocyte-dendritic cell interactions and transcriptional programs enriched in neutrophil degranulation pathways. In vivo, Gyg1 was markedly upregulated in septic mice, and LNP-mediated siRNA knockdown of Gyg1 significantly improved survival in the LPS model. Mechanistically, Gyg1 knockdown significantly reduced glycogen content in myeloid cells, attenuated IL-6 and TNF-alpha production, alleviated LPS-induced neutrophil, and modestly decreased CD40 expression in monocytes and dendritic cells. These results collectively suggest that Gyg1 regulates metabolic fueling of inflammatory activation and intercellular communication during sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative multi-omics study established a robust immune-metabolic risk score system to predict sepsis patient outcomes and identified GYG1 as a metabolic driver of innate immune hyperactivation. Targeting GYG1 via LNP-siRNA delivery reduces glycogen availability and inflammatory output in myeloid cells, mitigating immune overactivation and improving disease outcomes in vivo, thereby highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target for sepsis."

METHODS: Nine databases were searched (inception-May 2025). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (QUADAS-2). Bivariate models (STATA 18.0) generated pooled estimates. RESULTS: 15studies (1,338participants; 337 AKI cases) were included. Overall accuracy: Sensitivity 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.91), Specificity 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76-0.91), AUROC 0.91. Key subgroups: High-risk Neonates: AUROC 0.96, NLR 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02-0.78), Critically Ill/Sepsis: AUROC 0.88, NLR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.04-0.64), ELISA testing: Sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-0.96), NLR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.05-0.43); NephroCheck(R) Test: AUROC 0.79; Funnel plot asymmetry suggested publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-2/IGFBP7 show high diagnostic accuracy across pediatric settings, supporting their clinical utility.

41332235,Clinical Study evaluating the Diagnostic Value of Cardiac Ultrasound Parameters Combined With Serum miR-324-3p in Septic Cardiac Dysfunction.,2025,"Ultrasonic examinations showed significant limitations in the early detection and prognostic prediction of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), needing assisting biomarkers. The diagnostic and prognostic potential of miR-324-3p in SIMD was evaluated in this study, aiming to explore a novel biomarker. The functional role of miR-324-3p in regulating myocardial cell injury was assessed in H9c2 cells. The study enrolled 210 sepsis patients, including 98 patients diagnosed with SIMD. The significance of miR-324-3p in SIMD risk prediction, screening, and prognosis prediction was evaluated. Moreover, ultrasonic parameters, involving LVEF, LVDd, LAD, and FS, were compared between sepsis and SIMD patients, and the diagnostic and prognostic values of these parameters were also assessed. Silencing miR-324-3p exerted significantly protective effects on myocardial cell injury. Increasing serum miR-324-3p was observed in SIMD patients and was positively correlated with Dallas grades. LVEF, LVDd, LAD, and FS also showed significance in discriminating SIMD patients, but a single parameter cannot possess both satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. Serum miR-324-3p could help improve the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ultrasonic parameters in screening SIMD, and miR-324-3p was also identified as an independent risk factor for the adverse prognosis of SIMD patients."
41331894,[Research progress on the relationship between lactate-related indicators and sepsis].,2025,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis. However, sepsis remains the main cause of high mortality among critically ill patients worldwide. Early diagnosis, timely treatment, and accurate prediction of the prognosis are crucial for the successful treatment of septic patients. Lactic acid not only serves as a diagnostic indicator for septic shock but also participates in the immune response process of sepsis. It regulates gene epigenetic regulation through lactylation, thereby affecting the expression of related genes, cellular metabolism, and the immune response of the body. Therefore, it may become a new target for the treatment of sepsis. Lactate-related indicators, such as lactic acid/albumin ratio (LAR) and lactic acid/hematocrit ratio (LHR), also have important value in the prognosis assessment of septic patients and are superior to the evaluation efficacy of a single indicator. This is of great significance for timely detection of the changes in the condition of septic patients and their risk stratification and precise treatment. This review focused on the relationship between lactylation, lactatization, lactate-related indicators and sepsis, as well as the latest research progress. By revealing their roles in the occurrence, development and prognosis of sepsis, it provided new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment, uncovered new mechanisms of disease onset, guided disease risk stratification, optimized existing treatment strategies, and also offered new references and directions for basic research on lactate-related indicators."
41331889,[Establishment and evaluation of a machine learning prediction model for sepsis-related encephalopathy in the elderly].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To construct machine learning prediction model for sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), and analyze the application value of the model on early identification of SAE risk in elderly septic patients. METHODS: Patients aged over 60 years with a primary diagnosis of sepsis admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 2008 to 2023 were selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2). Demographic variables, disease severity scores, comorbidities, interventions, laboratory indicators, and hospitalization details were collected. Key factors associated with SAE were identified using univariate Logistic regression analysis. The data were randomly divided into training and validation sets in a 7 : 3 ratio. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was conducted in the training set and visualized using a nomogram model for prediction of SAE. The discrimination of the model was evaluated in the validation set using the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), and its calibration was assessed using calibration curve. Furthermore, multiple machine learning algorithms, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), naive bayes (NB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), were constructed in the training set. Their predictive performance was subsequently evaluated on the validation set. Taking the XGB model as an example, the interpretability of the model through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was enhanced to identify the key predictive factors and their contributions. RESULTS: A total of 2 204 septic patients were finally enrolled, of whom 840 developed SAE (38.1%). A total of 21 variables associated with SAE were screened through univariate Logistic regression analysis. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that endotracheal intubation [odds ratio (OR) = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.19-0.88, P < 0.001], oxygen therapy (OR = 0.76, 95%CI was 0.53-0.95, P = 0.023), tracheotomy (OR = 0.20, 95%CI was 0.07-0.53, P < 0.001), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT; OR = 0.32, 95%CI was 0.15-0.70, P < 0.001), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 0.31, 95%CI was 0.16-0.60, P < 0.001), rheumatic disease (OR = 0.44, 95%CI was 0.19-0.99, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.68, 95%CI was 0.54-0.86, P = 0.001), and maximum anion gap (AG; OR = 0.95, 95%CI was 0.93-0.97, P < 0.001) were associated with an decreased probability of SAE, and age (OR = 1.05, 95%CI was 1.03-1.06, P < 0.001), acute physiology score III (APSIII; OR = 1.02, 95%CI was 1.01-1.02, P < 0.001), Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS; OR = 1.04, 95%CI was 1.03-1.06, P < 0.001), and length of hospital stay (OR = 1.01, 95%CI was 1.01-1.02, P < 0.001) were associated with an increased probability of SAE. A nomogram model was constructed based on these variables. In the validation set, ROC curve analysis showed that the model achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.723, and the calibration curve showed good consistency between the predicted probability of the model and the observed probability. Among the machine learning algorithms, including MLP, SVM, NB, GBM, RF, and XGB, the SVM model and RF model demonstrated relatively good predictive performance, with AUC of 0.748 and 0.739, respectively, and the sensitivity was both exceeding 85%. The predictive performance of the XGB model was explained through SHAP analysis, and the results indicated that APSIII score (SHAP value was 0.871), age (SHAP value was 0.521), and OASIS score (SHAP value was 0.443) were important factors affecting the predictive performance of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning-based SAE prediction model exhibits good predictive capability and holds significant application value for the early identification of SAE risk in elderly septic patients."
41329523,Longitudinal multiomic signatures of ARDS and sepsis inflammatory phenotypes identify pathways associated with mortality.,2026,"BACKGROUNDCritically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis exhibit distinct inflammatory phenotypes with divergent clinical outcomes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenotypes, derived from clinical data and protein biomarkers, were associated with metabolic differences in a pilot study.METHODSWe performed integrative multiomics analysis of blood samples from 160 patients with ARDS in the ROSE trial, randomly selecting 80 patients from each latent class analysis-defined inflammatory phenotype (hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory) with phenotype probability greater than 0.9. Untargeted plasma metabolomics and whole-blood transcriptomics at day 0 and day 2 were analyzed using multimodal factor analysis (MEFISTO). The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, with validation in an independent critically ill sepsis cohort (EARLI).RESULTSMultiomics integration revealed 4 molecular signatures associated with mortality: (a) enhanced innate immune activation coupled with increased glycolysis (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), (b) hepatic dysfunction and immune dysfunction paired with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), (c) interferon program suppression coupled with altered mitochondrial respiration (associated with hyperinflammatory phenotype), and (d) redox impairment and cell proliferation pathways (not associated with inflammatory phenotype). These signatures persisted through day 2 of trial enrollment. Within-phenotype analysis revealed distinct mortality-associated pathways in each group. All molecular signatures were validated in the independent EARLI cohort.CONCLUSIONInflammatory phenotypes of ARDS reflect distinct underlying biological processes with both phenotype-specific and phenotype-independent pathways influencing patient outcomes, all characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for precise treatment strategies in critical illness.FUNDINGNIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Institute of General Medical Sciences."
41329233,Narrative review on microbiota and sepsis: the host's betrayal?,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota, long considered a ""less relevant"" to human body health, it plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Disruption of the host-microbe balance contributes to impaired barrier integrity, microbial translocation, and dysregulated immune responses. This perspective raises the possibility that dysbiosis is not merely a consequence of critical illness, rather an active driver of septic progression. This narrative review explores the relationship between sepsis and gut microbiome. PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from inception to September 2025. Recent studies have highlighted the triangular interplay between the intestinal barrier, gut microbiota, and immune system. Altered microbial composition and increased permeability foster systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. Biomarkers such as diamine oxidase and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein are emerging as promising indicators of gut injury. Experimental therapies (i.e., faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and personalized antibiotic regimens guided by microbial profiling) provide potential to modulate host-microbe interactions. Integration of microbiome analysis with multi-omics and advanced bioinformatics may enable stratification of septic patients by microbial signatures, paving the way for precision medicine approaches. Modulation of gut microbiota represents a novel therapeutic frontier in sepsis. Conceptualizing sepsis as a disease of disrupted host-microbe symbiosis may unravel new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Future research should aim at prioritizing high-quality trials, innovative designs, and equitable implementation to target microbiota to improve survival and recovery in patients with sepsis."
41327646,An expanding abdominal aorta ulcer as a rare complication of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis in a hemodialysis patient: A case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis are at high risk of severe infections. The co-occurrence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and penetrating aortic ulcer in this population is rare, posing notable therapeutic challenges. METHODS: A case of a 73-year-old male end-stage renal disease hemodialysis patient was analyzed. The patient presented with left flank pain, nausea, and anorexia. Diagnoses and treatment adjustments were based on laboratory tests, computed tomography angiography, and serial monitoring of biomarkers and imaging. RESULTS: Laboratory tests showed severe inflammation (white blood cell: 23.95 x 10(9)/L; C-reactive protein: 196.06 mg/L; procalcitonin: 21.15 ng/mL) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia. computed tomography angiography revealed abdominal aortic ulcer with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initial meropenem/linezolid was switched to vancomycin post-culture; further adjustment to piperacillin-tazobactam/moxifloxacin followed ulcer progression. The patient refused surgery, received conservative treatment, and had Candida albicans superinfection on hospital day 20 (treated with fluconazole). He was discharged with reduced inflammatory markers and resolved symptoms, but follow-up showed ulcer expansion with hematoma (high rupture risk). CONCLUSION: Aortic infections in dialysis patients are therapeutically challenging. Serial biomarker monitoring and imaging are crucial for detecting disease progression, even with improved clinical symptoms."
41327452,Cell-free DNA in sepsis: from molecular insights to clinical management.,2025,"Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that frequently results in fatal multiple organ dysfunction. Despite advances in clinical identification and management, both its incidence and mortality have remained persistently high. Emerging evidence indicates that cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as a novel biomarker and molecular therapeutic target, holds promise for improving the clinical management of sepsis. cfDNA refers to DNA fragments present in body fluids, including naked DNA, membrane-coated DNA, nucleosomes, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). cfDNA is released from host cells or pathogens into body fluids through pathways, such as NETosis, mitochondrial damage, cell necrosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and erythroblast enucleation. The released cfDNA triggers a strong inflammatory response by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome, and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. At the same time, cfDNA activates the coagulation cascade and inhibits anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems through multiple mechanisms, resulting in microcirculatory disorders. These pathological effects are closely associated with sepsis-related organ dysfunction and poor prognosis. Elucidation of the release and pathological mechanisms of cfDNA provides a foundation for the development of targeted treatment strategies. Currently, molecular therapeutic approaches targeting cfDNA, including peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) 4 inhibitors, pore-forming inhibitors, antioxidants, cfDNA scavengers, and deoxyribonucleases (DNases), have shown certain efficacy in treating sepsis and systemic inflammation. In terms of sepsis monitoring, compared with traditional markers, cfDNA exhibits extremely high timeliness and dynamic monitoring capability. cfDNA can simultaneously indicate the complex interplay among infection, host response, and organ damage, making it suitable for early diagnosis, prognosis assessment, treatment monitoring, organ function evaluation, and pathogen detection. Given its broad application prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, this paper systematically elaborates on the mechanisms of cfDNA release and pathological effects in sepsis, reviews progress in cfDNA-targeted monitoring and therapeutic strategies, discusses technical challenges, and outlines potential future directions."
41327338,Association of the atherogenic index of plasma with in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Few inexpensive early parameters are available to describe sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) in practice. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP = log(1)(0)[TG/HDL-C]) integrates triglyceride excess and HDL-C depletion-metabolic shifts implicated in endothelial injury and thrombosis. We evaluated the association between the AIP and in-hospital mortality in patients with SIC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with SIC admitted to the ICU of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (2017-2023). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic models adjusted sequentially for age/sex and Boruta/LASSO-selected covariates (age, SOFA score, albumin, sodium, potassium, ventilation, and renal diseases) plus major comorbidities. Dose-response was assessed by restricted cubic splines. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different SIC criteria and alternative adjustment strategies to verify robustness. Machine learning (CatBoost, RF, LR, and MLP) classifiers were compared for discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: 1096 patients were included. Higher baseline AIP was associated with increased mortality across models (per-SD OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.53, fully adjusted). Restricted cubic splines supported an approximately linear association. The logistic model reached an AUROC of 0.71 in the test set, with a positive net benefit on decision curve analysis. Additional machine-learning models showed comparable discrimination in the test set (AUROC around 0.70). SHAP analysis indicated that ventilation contributed most strongly to model predictions, with AIP also emerging as an important prognostic feature. CONCLUSIONS: A higher AIP is linked to increasing in-hospital mortality in SIC patients, which aligns with the metabolic-vascular disturbances that the AIP captures. When used as a complementary measure, the AIP may aid early clinical appraisal without implying stand-alone prognostication.

41326582,Integrated multi-omics of mitophagy-related molecular subtype characterization and biomarker identification in sepsis.,2025,"As a life-threatening condition driven by dysregulated host responses to infection, sepsis suffers from high mortality and heterogeneity. Mitophagy is the selective removal of damaged mitochondria, which is implicated in mitigating sepsis-related damage. The systematic identification and validation of key mitophagy-associated genes (MAG) for sepsis diagnosis, stratification, and immune modulation are lacking. Bulk transcriptomic datasets were integrated for differential expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning. We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data to map MAG expression, performed immune infiltration analyses by ESTIMATE, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and conducted consensus clustering based on MAG for molecular subtyping. As a screened MAG, the role of NUP93 was functionally validated in mitophagy using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with adenoviral overexpression. Integration of machine learning identified four MAG biomarkers (RPL18, PRPF8, NUP93, CUL1) with high diagnostic power (individual AUCs 0.957-0.975, nomogram AUC = 0.990). Consensus clustering based on these MAG stratified sepsis patients into distinct molecular subtypes with differing MAG expression, immune landscapes, and underlying immune-related pathways. NUP93 overexpression in vitro rescued LPS-induced mitophagy impairment by restoring mitochondrial PINK1 and LC3B levels. This study identifies RPL18, PRPF8, NUP93, and CUL1 as robust diagnostic MAG biomarkers for sepsis, demonstrates their utility in defining molecular subtypes with divergent immune microenvironments, and provides functional evidence that NUP93 promotes mitophagy during sepsis, offering novel tools for precision diagnosis and insights for targeted therapeutic strategies."
41325856,Age-specific predictive modelling of sepsis mortality: The diagnostic utility of CRP and serum creatinine.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of global mortality, with culture-negative cases posing major challenges to diagnosis and risk stratification. This study explores the utility of commonly used biomarkers in predicting sepsis-induced mortality and evaluates the performance of age-stratified binary logistic regression model. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted over one year, including 960 patients with suspected sepsis. Clinical parameters including procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), Total Leucocyte count (TLC), blood culture & other relevant variables related to sepsis were recorded. Binary logistic regression models were developed separately for each age group (new-born/infants, adults, older adults) to predict the sepsis-induced mortality. RESULTS: A statistically significant logistic regression model was achieved only in the new-born/infant group. CRP levels >/=100 mg/L emerged as a strong and independent predictor of mortality (AUC = 0.80, p = 0.02). Although serum creatinine demonstrated a significant association in univariate analysis, it did not retain significance in the multivariate model. PCT levels and blood culture positivity were not significant predictors of mortality in any age group. In adults and older adults, model performance was poor, showing a strong class imbalance and limited sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The strong predictive value of CRP in the new-born/infant group serves as a revalidation of its clinical utility in sepsis, particularly in the context of the poor performance of other commonly used biomarkers such as PCT and TLC. The results also highlight the importance of age-specific modelling and reinforce the need for a multi-marker approach in sepsis diagnostics."
41325481,Association between the atherogenic index of plasma and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with sepsis: A retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a recognized marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between AIP and the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with sepsis has not yet been investigated. METHODS: The data used in this study were derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The clinical outcome was the occurrence of AKI. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between AIP and the risk of AKI in sepsis patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was applied to explore potential non-linear relationships. Threshold analysis confirmed a turning point at this value. Subgroup analyses evaluated the consistency of the association across different strata. Mediation analysis was performed to explore potential intermediate variables. RESULTS: Among 1,874 sepsis patients, higher AIP levels were associated with increased AKI incidence. Logistic regression showed a significant association between AIP and AKI in unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but the association was no longer significant after full adjustment. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship with a peak AKI risk at AIP = 1.333. Threshold analysis confirmed a turning point at this value. Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations, while nonlinear effects were more evident in specific groups. Mediation analysis suggested that SOFA score, creatinine, WBC count, and respiratory rate partially mediated the AIP-AKI relationship. CONCLUSION: AIP was nonlinearly associated with AKI in sepsis, with a clear threshold effect. This relationship was partially mediated by SOFA score, creatinine, WBC, and respiratory rate. AIP may serve as a useful marker for AKI risk assessment."
41324739,"Sepsis-associated immunosuppression: mechanistic Insights, Biomarkers, and therapeutic perspectives.",2025,"Sepsis is recognized as a major global health concern, characterized by a dysregulated and uncontrolled host response to infection that results in organ dysfunction and high mortality. Clinically, the course of sepsis typically begins with an intense hyperinflammatory phase, which is often followed by an immunosuppressive stage in many patients. This immunosuppressive state significantly increases susceptibility to secondary infections, complicates treatment, and worsens overall survival. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis-associated immune dysfunction involves profound alterations in immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. In addition, metabolic reprogramming through signaling pathways such as mTOR, AMPK, and PI3K-Akt contributes to the imbalance of immune responses and the deepening of immunosuppression. Currently, biomarkers such as HLA-DR expression are employed to monitor immune status and to predict clinical outcomes in septic patients. From a therapeutic perspective, the use of immunostimulatory agents, biomarker-guided monitoring, and personalized immunomodulatory strategies has gained increasing attention. Recent clinical and experimental findings suggest that these approaches may help restore immune competence and improve patient outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge regarding the cellular, molecular, and metabolic mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated immunosuppression and to discuss their potential implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."
41324692,Temporal robustness of biomarker-based classification algorithms for sepsis.,2026,"PURPOSE: Heterogeneity of the host response in sepsis hampers development of effective treatments. Several immunobiologically distinct subphenotypes (or endotypes) have been identified using data-driven analyses of single-timepoint biomarker data, but their temporal stability remains uncertain due to dynamic biology and statistical limitations. METHODS: We analyzed data from 345 sepsis patients across two ICU cohorts. 30 immune biomarkers were measured every 8 h for up to 7 days. Latent profile analysis was used to identify classes upon admission and re-classify patients at later timepoints. Temporal robustness was assessed by (1) inter-class transition rates, and (2) intra-class cohesion (regardless of label) using the Rand Index (RI). RESULTS: At ICU admission, three immune profiles were identified: profile A (149 patients, 43%) reflected adaptive immune activation (elevated IL-4, IL-5, RANTES, and GM-CSF); profile B (60 patients, 17%) a hyperinflammatory state (high IL-6, IL-8, IL-1Ra, and low protein C); and profile C (136 patients, 39%) broadly attenuated inflammation. By 48 h, the prevalences of A and B declined to 31% and 13%, while C increased to 56%. Inter-class transitions occurred most in patients assigned to A (41% of all 8-hourly transitions), compared to 39% and 22% for B and C. Intra-class cohesion across intervals was poor (median RI 65%, IQR 62-64%), indicating that patients classified together at admission did not remain consistently together. CONCLUSION: Sepsis patients were frequently reclassified across immune profiles over short intervals, with approximately one-third of subgroup peers changing at each timepoint. This instability challenges the clinical utility of biomarker-derived endotypes."
41324403,Cancer Patients with Sepsis: Prognostic Insights from a Population-Based Cohort Study in Norway.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who had sepsis experience a higher mortality risk than noncancer patients. However, it remains unclear how this risk varies with cancer type and metastasis status, sex, age, and infecting microbe. METHODS: This nationwide cohort study included all noncancer patients and those with cancer >/=18 years hospitalized with sepsis in Norway from 2008 to 2021. Cancer status, sepsis, and hospital mortality were identified from the Norwegian Patient Registry (International Classification of Diseases 10th revision codes). Multivariable regression analyses estimated absolute and relative risks (RR) of hospital mortality across subgroups. RESULTS: Of 222,832 hospitalized patients with sepsis, 37,692 (16.9%) had cancer. Hospital mortality was higher in patients with cancer, at 16.9% (males) and 16.2% (females) with nonmetastatic disease, and at 27.1% (males) and 26.2% (females) with metastatic disease. Compared with noncancer patients, adjusted RRs (95% confidence interval) of hospital death were 1.39 (1.34-1.44, males) and 1.63 (1.55-1.71, females) for nonmetastatic cancer and 2.27 (2.18-2.37, males) and 2.75 (2.62-2.89, females) for metastatic cancer. The type of cancer was a key prognostic factor. The association between cancer and mortality was strongest in metastatic patients below 50 years [males 40-49 years: RR, 5.94 (4.43-7.97); females 18-39 years: RR, 8.28 (5.12-13.37)] and in those with gram-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The increased hospital mortality in patients with cancer varied with cancer type and the presence of metastasis. The association between cancer and mortality was strongest in females and young adults, as well as in gram-negative sepsis. IMPACT: Knowledge of the specific aspects of sepsis in patients with cancer may improve cancer care and guide future research on targeted sepsis therapies."
41324322,Identifying effective diagnostic biomarkers in sepsis by bioinformatics analysis.,2025,"Identifying appropriate biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and treatment holds great significance. This study aims to explore potential sepsis biomarkers through bioinformatics analysis. The expression profile data of sepsis were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Hub genes were screened and performed functional analysis, therewith verified using external datasets. The mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents were also identified. A total of 14 Hub genes were identified in this study including PRF1, CD247, IL7R, CD27, CCR7, IL2RB, GZMB, KLRK1, GZMK, CD160, FCGR1A, RUNX3, HLA-DRB1 and PRKCQ, which may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of sepsis."
41324108,Association of Long-Term Oral beta-Blocker Use With Cardiac Troponin I and B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Septic Myocardial Injury: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Septic myocardial injury, characterized by elevated levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is associated with increased mortality in sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate whether chronic oral beta-blocker use is associated with reduced cardiac biomarker levels and improved short-term outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 289 patients diagnosed with septic myocardial injury admitted to the ICU/EICU from January 2015 to June 2020. Patients were stratified into chronic beta-blocker users (n = 102) and non-users (n = 187). Associations between beta-blocker use and serum cTnI and BNP levels were analyzed using univariate and multivariate linear regression, adjusting for age, severity scores (SOFA, APACHE II), infection site, and vasopressor use. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and ICU length of stay. Subgroup analyses were performed by age and infection site. RESULTS: Chronic beta-blocker use was independently associated with significantly lower serum levels of cTnI (0.19 vs. 0.29 mug/L; beta = -0.07; 95% CI: -0.12 to -0.02; p < 0.001) and BNP (627 vs. 690 ng/L; beta = -36.6; 95% CI: -69.6 to -3.5; p = 0.03). However, no significant differences were observed in 28-day mortality or ICU length of stay. Subgroup analysis revealed greater biomarker reductions in patients under 60 years old and those with pulmonary infections, though sample sizes were limited. CONCLUSION: Long-term beta-blocker therapy is associated with lower levels of cardiac injury biomarkers in patients with septic myocardial injury. Subgroup analyses revealed greater reductions in younger patients and those with pulmonary infections, though these findings are exploratory. However, these biochemical improvements did not translate into short-term survival benefits. Prospective trials are needed to determine whether myocardial protection translates into clinical benefit."
41323250,Adapting a commercial sample extraction protocol for biosafety level 3/4 compatible plasma metabolomics analysis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Severe infections and sepsis significantly impact military operational readiness and costs through loss of duty days, high treatment rates, and medical evacuations. Early diagnosis is critical for preventing sepsis progression and mortality, but it requires validated biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making. Study protocols for host biomarker discovery in infections usually require inactivation of high-risk pathogens prior to sample analysis, which limits the utility of metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples. METHODS: Matched blood plasma aliquots obtained from an international, observational sepsis cohort were analyzed to quantify metabolites following the commercial AbsoluteIDQ p180 protocol, with and without the addition of an organic solvent extraction method for metabolites, proteins, and lipids (MPLEx), previously validated for inactivating BSL-3/4 pathogens. We evaluated analyte detection rates and concentrations for each method, as well as differences in extraction efficiency. RESULTS: Levels of agreement between the unmodified AbsoluteIDQ p180 and combined MPLEx-p180 methods varied by metabolite class. Most targeted amino acids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and monosaccharides were reliably measured and correlated well between methods. However, the higher sample dilution in the MPLEx-p180 method significantly reduced detection rates for biogenic amines and acylcarnitines, and overall extraction efficiencies also differed. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the applicability of commercial metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples by improving their suitability for high-risk infectious disease studies. Differences in metabolite extraction efficiencies and detection rates, as well as data harmonization strategies, should be considered if results from both protocols are to be combined."
41321934,PD-L1 and the risk of bacterial infection in patients with chronic liver diseases: An international multicohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Impaired phagocytic capacity due to activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has been implicated in the development of bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) is easily measurable in plasma and has been proposed as a biomarker of sepsis. In the current study, we aim to evaluate the role of sPD-L1 as a biomarker of bacterial infection development in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Plasma samples from 995 patients with chronic liver disease grouped in three cohorts were analyzed: an initial cohort of 268 hospitalized patients with acute decompensated cirrhosis, 327 out-patients with non-acute decompensated cirrhosis and finally 400 patients with high-risk alcohol consumption, including all stages of liver fibrosis, from mild/no fibrosis to cirrhosis (F0-F4). The main outcomes of the study were development of bacterial infection and mortality. RESULTS: Patients who developed bacterial infections had higher median levels of sPD-L1 than those who did not (160 [IQR 116-221] vs. 136 [IQR 97-193] pg/ml, respectively, p value <0.001; hazard ratio 1.034, 95% CI 1.014-1.055). Levels of sPD-L1 were associated with bacterial infection development after adjustment for confounding factors. During follow-up, patients who died had higher median sPD-L1 levels than survivors, after adjustment for MELD Na (180 [IQR 143-267] vs. 134 [IQR 97-187] pg/ml, respectively; p value <0.001; HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043-1.089). These findings were observed in all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of sPD-L1 are associated with the risk of bacterial infection development irrespective of the stage of chronic liver disease. Furthermore, higher sPD-L1 levels are linked to increased mortality. Measurement of sPD-L1 levels may help identify patients at high risk of developing bacterial infections and guide the implementation of new preventive strategies. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study explores the role of soluble PD-L1 as a biomarker of immune dysfunction and its association with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. Our findings demonstrate that soluble PD-L1 levels increase with the progression of liver disease and they are independently associated with an increased risk of bacterial infection development and mortality. These results could help physicians identify high-risk individuals earlier and implement preventive strategies."
41319124,Ventilator-induced brain injury: another iatrogenic complication of mechanical ventilation.,2026,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mechanical ventilation is life-saving, but is increasingly recognized to be involved in adverse neurological outcomes. Ventilator-associated brain injury (VABI) refers to primary brain dysfunction directly attributable to mechanical ventilation, independent of sedation, hypoxemia, or sepsis. This review summarizes current evidence on the pathophysiology, clinical impact, monitoring strategies, and potential therapeutic interventions for VABI. RECENT FINDINGS: A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies suggest that mechanical ventilation contributes to hippocampal apoptosis, maladaptive vagal and purinergic signaling, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, altered CO 2 regulation, and nasal airflow abolition. Clinically, VABI may manifest as delirium, disordered sleep, prolonged weaning, and long-term cognitive impairment. Monitoring tools such as electroencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, cerebral biomarkers, Doppler ultrasound, and MRI offer complementary but indirect insights. As of today, preventive and therapeutic strategies focus on lung-protective ventilation, limited sedation, early mobilization, and good quality sleep promotion. Some innovative approaches such restoration of nasal airflow, phrenic and vagal stimulation remain experimental. SUMMARY: VABI is increasingly recognized as a critical research frontier in critical care medicine. Awareness of its mechanisms and clinical impact should prompt ICU clinicians to integrate brain-oriented practices into routine care. Future trials are needed to evaluate preventive strategies and improve long-term cognitive and functional outcomes for ICU survivors."
41318541,The PIK3C3/MAPK14 axis drives M1 polarization via autophagy Inhibition to exacerbate Sepsis-Induced acute lung injury.,2025,"Dysregulation of macrophage autophagy plays a critical role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI); however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the regulatory pathway involving the PIK3C3-MAPK14 signaling axis that drives ALI progression by controlling autophagy and macrophage polarization. Using machine learning transcriptomic analysis, MAPK14 was identified as a core gene associated with ALI, and multi-omics integration confirmed its upregulated expression in ALI tissues. MAPK14 localization to pro-inflammatory macrophages was determined using single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, we observed a significant positive correlation between MAPK14 and autophagy-related genes. Molecular docking and kinetic simulations revealed high-affinity interactions between PIK3C3 and MAPK14 (DeltaG-bind = -127.722 +/- 33.269 kJ/mol). In vitro experiments followed by Western Blot(WB) and RT-q polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide stimulation upregulated MAPK14 expression through downregulation of PIK3C3 expression, resulting in impaired autophagic flux (LC3-II/Ⅰ downward arrow, TOM20 upward arrow, P62 upward arrow, HSP60 upward arrow). Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed a shift toward pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization. RNA pull-down assay directly captured the PIK3C3-MAPK14 complex, and functional validation showed that PIK3C3 overexpression significantly inhibited MAPK14 protein expression, whereas PIK3C3 knockdown enhanced it. In conclusion, targeting the PIK3C3-MAPK14 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for ALI."
41317596,Identifying Predictive Biomarkers for Sepsis in Trauma-Induced Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Using Proteomics Data.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in surveillance, protocolized resuscitation, and critical care organ support, sepsis remains a common and fatal complication in trauma. Trauma-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can mask the occurrence of sepsis, complicating the diagnosis of sepsis. Thus, it is significant to identify high-risk patients of sepsis among trauma-induced SIRS for early prevention, early diagnosis, and early intervention of sepsis. This study seeks to identify predictive biomarkers for sepsis in patients with trauma-induced SIRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The existing plasma proteomics data from 62 severe trauma patients with (38 cases) and without (24 cases) SIRS were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 38 patients with SIRS, 15 SIRS patients who subsequently developed sepsis (SDS) were assigned to SDS group, while the remaining 23 SIRS patients who did not develop sepsis (SDDS) constituted SDDS group. By comparing the SDS and SDDS groups, predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS were identified. RESULTS: Fifteen differentially expressed proteins were identified between SDS and SDDS groups. We screened top 5 differentially expressed proteins as predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS, including ANXA6 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.881), FA12 (AUC = 0.873), TRY2 (AUC = 0.868), FIBG (AUC = 0.759), and DOPD (AUC = 0.745). The combined predictive performance of these biomarkers is better (AUC = 0.9913). To balance robust predictive performance with a minimal panel size, we developed a panel consisting of ANXA6 and FIBG, which demonstrated superior predictive performance (AUC = 0.9652). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified predictive biomarkers for sepsis in trauma-induced SIRS. Notably, integrating coagulation and inflammatory markers enabled substantial reduction in the number of required modeling indicators while preserving superior diagnostic performance. These findings offer new insights into developing early predictive panels."
41316366,Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic duration for hospitalized patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic duration for critically ill adults with sepsis may be clinically effective and safe. However, cost-effectiveness analyses using clinical trial data for this precision medicine approach in critical care are lacking. This economic evaluation investigates the cost-effectiveness of a daily PCT-guided protocol to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment in adult patients with sepsis. METHODS: Two analyses were conducted, the first estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the ADAPT-Sepsis study, which recruited 2760 patients randomized to a daily PCT-guided protocol, a daily C-reactive protein-guided protocol and standard care. The second analysis used meta-analyzed results from ADAPT-Sepsis and other PCT-guided treatment studies and employed a lifetime horizon. Key outcomes were the incremental costs and QALYs gained from using the daily PCT-guided protocol approach compared with standard care. Other outcome measures included changes in days of antibiotics, days of hospital stay, days of intensive care unit stay, the percentage of deaths and the number of PCT tests performed. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results were driven by the assumed impact of PCT testing on mortality although the confidence/credible intervals for ADAPT-Sepsis and the meta-analyzed data both included no effect. Within ADAPT-Sepsis, the use of PCT tests cost euro427 more per patient and was associated with a small QALY loss (0.001), which suggests the daily PCT-guided protocol is dominated. Using meta-analyzed data, the daily PCT-guided protocol was assumed to cost euro330 more per patient but was associated with 0.139 more QALYs, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of euro2384. If only antibiotic use and PCT tests were assumed to differ then PCT testing is estimated to cost no more than euro110 per patient with QALYs equal in both arms regardless of whether ADAPT-Sepsis or meta-analyzed data were used. CONCLUSIONS: This economic analysis has shown that a PCT-guided protocol to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment could be cost-effective. Where only differences in antibiotic use and PCT testing are assumed, the increased costs per patient are modest which may be seen as worthwhile to safely improve antibiotic stewardship for critically ill adult patients with sepsis."
41315982,Accuracy is not enough: explainable boosting machine model and identification of candidate biomarkers for real-time sepsis risk assessment in the emergency department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis poses a significant threat in emergency settings, necessitating tools for early and interpretable risk assessment. This study aimed to develop a robust explainable boosting machine (EBM) model, one of the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies, to construct a predictive model that balances high accuracy and clinical interpretability for use in emergency departments (EDs) and to examine candidate biomarkers. METHODS: The study identified a significant class imbalance problem in the sepsis distribution among 560 sepsis and 1012 non-sepsis patients. To address the imbalance issue, SMOTE-NC was applied in the training data. The data was divided into two parts, 80% training and 20% testing. To ensure the reliability of the models and to report unbiased results, this process was repeated 100 times and the average performance was reported. To determine the best model for sepsis prediction, five different models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, LightGBM, and EBM) were trained, and their performances were evaluated. In the last stage, we presented local and global explanations of EBM. RESULTS: The EBM model achieved the highest success by reaching 79.1% F1-score, 80.9% sensitivity, and 84.8% AUC after resampling. In the global explanations, the variables with the highest weights in the model's decision process were identified as positive blood culture, oxygen saturation, and procalcitonin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EBM model accurately predicts sepsis risk based on clinically relevant biomarkers. The model's high performance and inherent transparency can foster trust among clinicians and facilitate its integration into emergency department workflows for real-time decision support."
41314555,Decoding sepsis-associated encephalopathy: From blood-brain barrier injury to mechanism-based subphenotypes.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent but underrecognized complication of systemic infection, characterized by acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment in the absence of direct central nervous system infection. Despite its high morbidity and mortality, the mechanistic basis of SAE remains poorly defined, limiting early diagnosis and targeted intervention. This review synthesizes recent advances in the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of SAE, with emphasis on blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, glial cell activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter imbalance. We highlight the central role of BBB breakdown in facilitating peripheral-to-central immune signaling, which triggers a cascade of neuroinflammatory and metabolic events that collectively disrupt synaptic homeostasis and neuronal integrity. Emerging evidence also supports the existence of biologically distinct SAE subphenotypes, such as ischemic-hypoxic, inflammatory-dominant, and metabolic-degenerative types-each associated with specific molecular features and clinical outcomes. These insights underscore the need for biomarker-driven patient stratification and mechanism-targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research should prioritize the development of integrated diagnostic platforms, molecular phenotyping tools, and neuroprotective therapies that address the heterogeneous nature of SAE. A refined understanding of its pathogenesis holds promise for transforming the clinical management of SAE and improving long-term neurological recovery in sepsis survivors."
41314332,"Corticosteroids, rifampicin and LMWH impact plasma aMMP-8 and TIMP-1 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 molar ratio in methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.",2026,"OBJECTIVES: Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) predict outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). However, the impact of medications on MMPs and their prognostic capability in SAB lacks evaluation. METHODS: Prospective study with aMMP-8, TIMP-1, and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 determined in methicillin-sensitive SAB (MS-SAB). We evaluated the effect of the medications on MMPs. RESULTS: Overall, 395 patients with MS-SAB received 21 different medications. Most medications did not affect MMPs. Prehospital corticosteroids elevated day 3 aMMP-8 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P <0.01). In-hospital corticosteroids is associated with higher day 3 and 28 (P <0.01) aMMP-8 levels and higher day 3, 5, and 28 (P <0.01) aMMP-8/TIMP-1. Rifampicin elevated day 3, 5, and 28 aMMP-8 (P <0.01) and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P <0.05). Low-weight molecular heparin (LMWH) elevated day 3, 5, and 28 aMMP-8 and TIMP-1 (P <0.01) and day 5 and 28 aMMP-8/TIMP-1 (P < 0.05). A prognostic survival value of aMMP-8/TIMP-1 in Cox Regression was observed for patients treated with corticosteroids, rifampicin, or LMWH. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids, rifampicin, and LMWH may elevate aMMP-8 and aMMP-8/TIMP-1 levels in MS-SAB; however, the prognostic value of aMMP-8/TIMP-1 is not disrupted. Clinicians should consider the presence of corticosteroids, rifampicin, and LMWH when applying MMPs as biomarkers for risk stratification in patients with MS-SAB."
41314197,A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY ON THE TRENDS OF CAUSATIVE BACTERIA AND ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE PROFILES IN PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED SEPSIS FOLLOWING GASTRIC SLEEVE RESECTION.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Bacterial sepsis is a significant complication following open gastric sleeve surgery in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study describes the trends in causative bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles in patients who developed sepsis post-surgery, with inflammatory and glycemic biomarkers as supplementary data to elucidate sepsis pathophysiology. METHODS: The study included 128 patients (aged 25-40, BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2), T2DM) undergoing open gastric sleeve surgery and 40 individuals who underwent open gastric sleeve surgery but did not develop sepsis. Biomarkers (fasting glucose, HbA1c, procalcitonin [PCT], interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) were measured using Roche Cobas c111 and e411 analyzers. Bacterial pathogens were identified via VITEK 2, and antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer method. Statistical analyses used t-tests and chi-square tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Sepsis cases (n=40) showed significantly elevated biomarkers compared to controls (n=40): fasting glucose (143.28+/-37.79 vs. 82.85+/-8.12 mg/dL), PCT (7.60+/-3.07 vs. 0.055+/-0.031 ng/mL), TNF-alpha (17.23+/-5.04 vs. 6.62+/-2.10 pg/mL), IL-6 (12.47+/-4.63 vs. 3.06+/-1.35 pg/mL), and HbA1c (9.37+/-2.14% vs. 4.22+/-1.14%) (all p<0.001). Escherichia coli (70%) predominated, with high resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate (78.57%), ciprofloxacin (67.86%), and gentamicin (60.71%); carbapenems showed minimal resistance. Multidrug-resistant (60.71%) and extensively drug-resistant (21.43%) isolates were prevalent. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli dominates postoperative sepsis in this population, with significant AMR complicating treatment. These findings emphasize antibiotic management and tailored prophylaxis. Preoperative optimization efforts are supported by elevated biomarkers showing the role of inflammation and glucose imbalance in sepsis formation."
41314048,iNKT cells exacerbate Sepsis-associated acute lung injury through IFN-gamma-mediated promotion of macrophage apoptosis.,2026,"Sepsis is a lethal systemic inflammatory syndrome, frequently progresses to acute lung injury (ALI). This study integrates transcriptomics and Mendelian randomization to identify invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells as pivotal regulators of sepsis-associated ALI. Analysis of the GSE26378 dataset (|Log2FC| > 0.5, p < 0.05) with functional enrichment revealed immune dysregulation pathways. Bidirectional MR using FinnGen (R12_O15) and GWAS immune cell datasets (n = 731) confirmed iNKT's central role. In LPS-induced ALI models, CD1d(-/-) mice exhibited reduced pulmonary macrophage apoptosis and inflammation versus wild-type controls. In vitro, iNKT cell line DN32.D3 co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages under LPS/alpha-Galcer stimulation demonstrated IFN-gamma-dependent exacerbation of apoptosis and TNF-alpha/IL-6 releasing. IFN-gamma neutralization attenuated these effects. Transcriptomic profiling of activated iNKT cells identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) as a key mediator, with Western Blotting validation showing its marked upregulation in sepsis. Mechanistically, iNKT-IFN-gamma axis activation potentiates macrophage apoptotic susceptibility through ASC-driven pathways, amplifying cytokine storms that aggravate ALI. Therapeutic interventions targeting iNKT depletion or IFN-gamma blockade significantly mitigated lung injury metrics in both murine models and cellular systems. These findings establish iNKT cells as critical hubs linking innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in sepsis, with ASC serving as a novel regulatory node. The study provides a multi-omics framework for sepsis immunopathology, proposing targeted immunomodulation of the iNKT-IFN-gamma-Macrophages axis as a promising therapeutic strategy for ALI management."
41311783,Outcomes of Postoperative General Surgery Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND:  By identifying the risk factors that contribute to complications and difficulties in postoperative extubation, this study provides insights that can refine ICU strategies, guide clinical decisions, and ultimately enhance outcomes for surgical patients on mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in general surgery. METHODS:  This single-centre, hospital-based, prospective observational study included elective and emergency general surgery postoperative patients aged 18 years or older who required postoperative mechanical ventilation. The collected data included demographics, American Society of Anaesthesiologists scores (ASA), quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores (qSOFA), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), procalcitonin trends, and postoperative complications. The primary objective was to describe outcomes in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, with a focus on 30-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled during the study period, with 89 admitted to the ICU following emergency surgery and three after elective surgery. Within 30 days of surgery, mortality occurred in 59 patients, while 33 survived. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was significantly greater among non-survivors than among survivors. Both qSOFA >/= 2 and ASA > 3 scores were significantly associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the importance of clinical biomarkers and scoring systems, including qSOFA, APACHE II, international normalised ratio (INR), albumin, and procalcitonin in predicting mortality and guiding management strategies for general surgery patients requiring mechanical ventilation."
41310736,Predictive enrichment using biomarkers in studies of critically-ill patients with sepsis: a systematic review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains one of the most prevalent conditions necessitating admission to intensive care units and is associated with high mortality. Unfortunately, randomized trials examining therapeutics for critically-ill patients with sepsis have been disproportionately negative, failing to identify effective interventions, likely due to the dilution of treatment effects across highly diverse populations. Designing trials to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from an intervention based on biologic mechanism, known as predictive enrichment, may be an effective strategy for enhancing clinical trial efficacy. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the use of biological markers (biomarkers) used for predictive enrichment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted this review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. We included RCTs that enrolled adult patients with sepsis that used molecular biomarkers for predictive enrichment in their study design. We summarize study characteristics, biomarkers used, predictive enrichment strategies, and trial outcomes narratively without statistical pooling. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Of the 1,718 citations found with the search, we included 12 eligible studies. All studies used either blood-based circulating proteins or lipopolysaccharide markers for predictive enrichment. Five studies (42%) reported statistically significant impacts on the primary outcome, with three showing patient-important benefit (reduced mortality or disease severity) and two demonstrating improvements in surrogate outcomes related to biomarkers. Interventions that demonstrated benefit included immune, antimicrobial or coagulation modulating therapies. These five trials that showed benefit used suPAR, AT, mHLA-DR, IL-6 and EAA as biomarkers for predictive enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: This review characterizes the use of biomarkers for predictive enrichment in randomized trials of critically-ill patients with sepsis. Although the studies were heterogeneous in design and limited in number, those that employed biomarker-based enrichment strategies demonstrate a promising signal for enhanced clinical trial efficiency. The use of biomarkers for predictive enrichment in critical care trial design requires further exploration, investigation and validation."
41307996,GM-CSF and specific type 2 cytokines induce CD103(+) and CD301b(+) cell states in cDC1s and cDC2s.,2025,"The heterogeneity of conventional dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1s) and type 2 (cDC2s) is well established, yet the identity and origin of CD301b(+) cDC2s remain debated. Here, we show that CD301b(+) cDC2s and CD103(+) cDC1s develop from pre-committed progenitors in response to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). While CD103(+) cDC1s acquire their phenotype and functional properties through GM-CSF-driven differentiation from pre-cDC1s, CD301b(+) cDC2s emerge as cytokine-induced states from DC2- and DC3-committed progenitors. CD103(+) cDC1s and CD301b(+) cDC2s exhibit enhanced T cell priming capacities and distinct cytokine expression profiles upon GM-CSF exposure. In vivo, DC-intrinsic GM-CSF sensing is dispensable for acquiring CD103 and CD301b expression with the notable exception of lung DCs, while specific type 2 cytokines induce CD103 and CD301b ex vivo. These findings identify GM-CSF and specific type 2 cytokines as central regulators of cDC1 and cDC2 effector differentiation and establish CD301b as a marker of a cytokine-driven cDC2 state."
41306613,Identification and validation of potential shared diagnostic markers for sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy via WGCNA and machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis frequently results in complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiomyopathy. This study aims to identify common diagnostic markers and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these sepsis-induced complications. METHODS: We obtained datasets related to ARDS and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) from the GEO database and applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were integrated with key module genes. Feature genes were selected using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF) algorithms. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was constructed and its diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Machine learning algorithms effectively identified key hub genes associated with sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy, with their robustness validated through ROC analysis. A cellular model of sepsis-induced lung injury was employed to examine hub gene expression. Additionally, we investigated inflammation and immune responses by characterizing immune landscapes using CIBERSORT and performing correlation analyses among feature genes, immune infiltration, and clinical characteristics. Finally, potential small-molecule compounds were identified from the PubChem database. RESULTS: Five key genes-LCN2, AIF1L, STAT3, SOCS3 and SDHD-were identified. SOCS3 showed strong diagnostic potential with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) highlighting its role in biological processes and immune responses. SOCS3 expression correlated strongly with immune cells. Dexamethasone, resveratrol and curcumin were identified as potential SOCS3-targeting drugs. CONCLUSION: Five genes were identified as diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis-induced ARDS and cardiomyopathy, with SOCS3 serving as a key hub gene and potential therapeutic target."
41306522,"Predictors of mortality among neonates in Lusaka, Zambia: a comparative analysis of machine learning and traditional survival analysis techniques.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal mortality remains a critical global health issue, with 2.3 million deaths in 2022. Sub-Saharan Africa bears 57% of under five deaths despite only 30% of global births, with Zambia ranking fourth highest in terms of neonatal mortality among neighboring countries. While traditional survival analysis has identified neonatal mortality risk factors, machine learning-based prediction remains underexplored. This study aimed to identify factors associated with neonatal mortality and compare the predictive performance of traditional survival analysis and machine learning models among neonates in Lusaka, Zambia (January2018-September 2019). METHODS: Demographic and clinical data from 1,018 neonates were analyzed using seven models: Weibull, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net (regularized Cox), Random Survival Forests, DeepSurv neural networks and Gradient Boosting Machines. Model performance was evaluated using nested cross-validation with five outer folds and three inner folds for hyperparameter tuning. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the concordance index, time dependent area under the curve at 7, 14, and 28 days, brier scores, and calibration plots. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrated survival probabilities over time. RESULTS: Of the 1,018 neonates, 757 (74.3%) died. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (TR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.81) was associated with reduced survival, while higher birthweight was protective (TR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.60-2.20). Sepsis demonstrated a paradoxical association with longer survival (TR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30), which persisted in sensitivity analyses. Among predictive models, the Random Survival Forests achieved the highest discrimination (C-index = 0.731) and consistently low Brier scores, outperforming Weibull (C-index = 0.622) and penalized Cox models ( approximately 0.620). Gradient Boosting Machines were most miscalibrated, and DeepSurv showed low discrimination (C-index = 0.553). Feature importance analysis from Random Survival Forest identified birth weight as the dominant predictor, followed by sex, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. DISCUSSION: While traditional Weibull models remain valuable for interpretability, machine learning approaches provide enhanced predictive accuracy. Hybrid modeling strategies may improve early risk identification and inform neonatal care in resource-limited settings."
41305822,S100A12 as a key biomarker in a neutrophil-associated gene prediction model for sepsis diagnosis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. As a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units patients, it still lacks sensitive biomarkers. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a diagnostic model for sepsis and identify key driver biomarkers. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the GEO database, we constructed a diagnostic model through 113 machine learning (ML) frameworks, supplemented with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to identify pivotal genes. Results revealed a significant increase in myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the peripheral blood of sepsis patients. Screening identified 70 upregulated and 762 downregulated neutrophil-associated genes, which were intersected with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy controls and sepsis patients, yielding 13 overlapping genes - including S100A12 - as potential drivers. These 13 genes were incorporated into 113 ML models. The Random Forest (RF) model, which included S100A12, PIK3AP1, HLA-DMB, and RETN, achieved the highest mean C-index with fewer features. Its robust diagnostic performance was validated using receiver operator characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. SHAP analysis highlighted S100A12 as the most influential driver gene and identified theophylline, aspirin, and aminophylline as potential targeting compounds. In conclusion, sepsis patients show increased peripheral neutrophils, an RF model based on 4 neutrophil-associated genes demonstrates strong diagnostic ability, and S100A12 serves as a key biomarker for sepsis."
41305720,Association between neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by an imbalanced host response to infection and remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) has recently emerged as a novel biomarker that integrates information on systemic inflammation and nutritional status. However, its role in predicting outcomes among septic patients has yet to be fully clarified. This study aimed to investigate the association between NPAR and all-cause mortality at 28-day, 90-day, and 365 day in patients diagnosed with sepsis. Using the medical information mart for intensive care-IV v3.1 database, we identified 6242 patients meeting the Sepsis-3.0 definition. Participants were categorized into tertiles based on NPAR values (Q1 < 23.8; 23.8 </= Q2 < 30.1; Q3 >/= 30.1). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to analyze associations between NPAR and mortality. Restricted cubic spline models assessed nonlinear trends, while receiver operating characteristic curves evaluated discriminative ability. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to visualize survival differences across NPAR groups. Patients in the highest NPAR tertile (Q3) exhibited significantly greater disease severity and higher mortality at 28 days (34.03% vs 22.28%), 90 days (43.54% vs 28.93%), and 365 days (52.33% vs 37.72%) compared to those in the lowest tertile (Q1; all P < .001). After adjusting for confounders, elevated NPAR remained an independent predictor of mortality at 28 days (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), 90 days (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.40), and 365 days (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.35). Restricted cubic spline analyses revealed a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between NPAR and mortality (P for nonlinearity < .001). Integrating NPAR with the sequential organ failure assessment score significantly enhanced predictive accuracy compared to sequential organ failure assessment alone (area under the curve: 0.624 vs 0.599, P < .001). Subgroup analysis indicated a more pronounced association in patients with congestive heart failure (P for interaction = .002). High NPAR levels are independently associated with increased short- and long-term mortality in sepsis. Given its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, NPAR could be a useful marker for early risk assessment and clinical decision-making in septic populations."
41305715,Exploring the biomarkers for diagnostic accuracy associated with glycolysis and macrophage polarization in pediatric sepsis and performing mechanistic studies.,2025,"The pediatric sepsis (PS) is characterized by severe clinical symptoms and high mortality. There was a lack of studies on the mechanisms of glycolysis and macrophage polarization (MP) in PS. The focus of this study was to identify biomarkers associated with glycolysis and MP in PS and to conduct mechanistic studies. The GSE26440 and GSE13904 datasets, glycolysis-related genes and macrophage polarization-related genes (MPRGs) were used in this study for analysis. First, to identify differentially expressed genes in GSE26440. Next, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis was taken to obtain key modular genes related between glycolysis and MP, and differentially expressed genes were overlapped with key modular genes to identify candidate genes. Subsequently, biomarkers were detected to biomarkers by constructing a protein-protein interaction network, machine learning and expression validation. Finally, based on the biomarkers, functional enrichment, regulatory network, immune microenvironment analysis, and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. After screening, 4 biomarkers (a disintegrin and a metalloprotease9 [ADAM9], transforming growth factor alpha [TGFA], G protein subunit alpha q [GNAQ], and decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 1 [PDSS1]) were obtained. The lysosome and fc gamma r mediated phagocytosis co-targeted 4 biomarkers in gene set enrichment analysis. Spearman correlation analysis showed that ADAM9, TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1 were significantly positively related to activated dendritic cells, and had a significantly negative correlation with activated B cells. Next, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs)-MicroRNAs (miRNAs)-mRNA network containing 7 microRNAs and 23 lncRNAs was constructed. The hsa-miR-302c-5P co-targeted ADAM9, TGFA, and PDSS1. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PS samples. In this study, 4 biomarkers (ADAM9, TGFA, GNAQ, and PDSS1) associated with glycolysis and MP were identified to provide scientific theories for the clinical management of PS."
41305706,Impact of medical history of severe COVID-19 infection on serum cytokine levels and prognosis in patients with sepsis: A prospective observational study.,2025,"A history of severe COVID-19 may have lasting effects on immune and coagulation dysfunction, potentially influencing sepsis outcomes. This study investigates the impact of severe COVID-19 history on inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and prognosis in sepsis patients. This prospective observational study included 181 sepsis patients, comprising 28 with a history of severe COVID-19 infection and 153 without such a history, admitted between October 2021 and May 2023. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, IL-17, and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Coagulation markers activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and D-dimer (D-D), inflammatory factor procalcitonin (PCT), and severity scores sequential organ failure assessment and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II were assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate 28-day mortality and associated risk factors. Patients with severe COVID-19 history showed significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores, along with elevated APTT, PCT, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-17 levels. CRP and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not differ significantly. Among patients with poor prognosis, IL-6, IL-17, and APTT levels were higher, and a larger proportion had a history of severe COVID-19 (36.8% vs 5.6%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed reduced 28-day survival in the severe COVID-19 group. Multivariate analysis identified BMI, sex, diabetes, severe COVID-19 history, PCT, D-D, and IL-17 as independent risk factors for poor outcomes. Sepsis patients with a history of severe COVID-19 exhibit more severe disease, immune dysregulation, coagulation abnormalities, and increased mortality, indicating long-term detrimental effects of prior infection on sepsis prognosis."
41304283,Phenyllactic Acid as a Marker of Antibiotic-Induced Metabolic Activity of Nosocomial Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae In Vitro Experiment.,2025,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a major nosocomial pathogen with increasing antibiotic resistance. Treatment failures and high mortality rates in sepsis caused by K. pneumoniae are associated with difficulties in choosing an adequate antibacterial therapy in the presence of resistance to all available antibiotics, based on the results of susceptibility tests. This study aimed to identify ""weak points"" in the metabolism of K. pneumoniae, to be able to use these features in the future. Ten nosocomial K. pneumoniae strains were incubated with fourteen broad-spectrum antibiotics representing major drug classes. Aromatic metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after 24 h exposure. Phenyllactic acid (PhLA), comprising 86% of detected phenylcarboxylic acids, served as the metabolic activity marker. Antibiotics demonstrated multidirectional effects on aromatic compound metabolism. Doxycycline, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, and tigecycline significantly suppressed metabolic activity, confirmed by decreased PhLA levels. Conversely, meropenem, cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefepime, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime), ciprofloxacin, and amikacin stimulated PhLA production, suggesting that bacterial metabolic activity was maintained despite the presence of antibiotics. PhLA is a promising biomarker for quantifying K. pneumoniae's metabolic response to antibiotics. This potentially introduces a novel approach for future investigations into resistance mechanisms and has the potential to increase the effectiveness of therapies for multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae infections by providing an additional analytical tool to traditional susceptibility testing methodologies."
41303672,Integrated Transcriptomic Analysis of S100A8/A9 as a Key Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Sepsis Pathogenesis and AI Drug Repurposing.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition driven by a dysregulated immune response, leading to systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure. Among the key molecular regulators, S100A8/A9 has emerged as a critical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, amplifying pro-inflammatory signaling via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways. Elevated S100A8/A9 levels correlate with disease severity, making it a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. To unravel the role of S100A8/A9 in sepsis, we integrate scRNA-seq and RNA-seq approaches. scRNA-seq enables cell-type-specific resolution of immune responses, uncovering cellular heterogeneity, state transitions, and inflammatory pathways at the single-cell level. In contrast, RNA-seq provides a comprehensive view of global transcriptomic alterations, allowing robust statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes. The integration of both approaches enables precise deconvolution of immune cell contributions, validation of cell-specific markers, and identification of potential therapeutic targets. Our findings highlight the S100A8/A9-driven inflammatory cascade, its impact on immune cell interactions, and its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in sepsis. Eight protein targets resulted from the integrative transcriptomics studies (corresponding to S100A8, S100A9, S100A6, NAMPT, FTH1, B2M, KLF6 and SRGN) have been used to predict interaction affinities with 2958 ChEMBL approved drugs, by using a pre-trained AI models (PLAPT) in order to point directions on drug repurposing in sepsis. The strongest predicted interactions have been confirmed with molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis. This study underscores the power of combining high-throughput transcriptomics to advance our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and develop precision medicine strategies."
41303442,"The Endocannabinoid-Microbiota-Neuroimmune Super-System: A Unifying Feedback Architecture for Systems Resilience, Collapse Trajectories, and Precision Feedback Medicine.",2025,"Modern biomedicine frequently contextualizes disease around isolated molecular or organ-specific mechanisms, but numerous chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, diabetes, and sepsis, share common trajectories of systemic destabilization. An increasing body of evidence indicates that health is not a property of single organs but the emergent property of interdependent feedback networks linking the microbiome, endocannabinoidome, neuroimmune system, and metabolic regulators. We propose the Endocannabinoid-Microbiota-Neuroimmune Super-System (EMN-S) as an evolutionarily conserved conceptual model that describes how these fields of influence reciprocally interact through feedback control. The microbial communities constituting the EMN-S encode environmental and dietary inputs, endocannabinoid signaling serves as an integrative regulator that synchronizes neural and immune activity, and neuroimmune circuits effectuate adaptive behaviors that alter microbiotal and lipid ecosystems. This review formalizes the EMN-S, contending that it is a unitary and cohesive model of physiological resilience, as well as offering a framework for precision feedback therapeutics. We describe how three mechanisms-encoder drift, integrator detuning, and executor overutilization-convert stabilizing negative feedback into runaway feedback cascades that underlie chronic, recurrent, and multisystemic disease. We then specify the EMN-S signature-integrated microbiome, lipidomic, and immune readouts-as an early indicator of resilience collapse and prospective preclinical state. Finally, we recapitulate the potential of AI-driven digital twins to illuminate feedback collapse, predict tipping points, and direct closed-loop intervention and treatments to restore dynamic equilibrium. By anchoring complexity in concrete and measurable feedback principles, the EMN-S shifts focus to investigate pathophysiology as opposed to reductionist lesion models of systemic derangements and embraces a systemic, empirically testable theory of stability."
41303181,Association Between the Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-Creatinine Ratio Trajectories and Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients: Insights from MIMIC-IV Database.,2025,"Background: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) accounts for approximately 30% of all stroke cases and has high mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUNCR) is a potential biomarker of catabolic stress in critically ill patients. Meanwhile, its dynamic prognostic value in ICU-admitted HS patients remains unclear. This study utilized Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) to investigate associations between early BUNCR patterns and mortality. Methods: This study was conducted using data from the MIMIC-IV (v2.2) database. HS cases were identified via ICD-9/10. BUNCR trajectories were assessed by applying GBTM during the first 7 days. Outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM) on day 28, on day 90, and at 1 year, with ICU and in-hospital mortality also evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test compared survival across groups. Multivariable Cox proportional models adjusted for confounders and subgroup analysis assessed robustness. Results: Among 2559 patients (52.48% male), mortality was 10.16% (ICU), 14.07% (in-hospital), 17.00% (28-day), 22.43% (90-day), and 36.97% (1-year). Three BUNCR trajectories were identified: Group 1 (upward-downward, n = 655), Group 2 (stable upward, n = 1270), and Group 3 (downward-upward, n = 634). Group 2 had the highest ACM risk at 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year (p < 0.01), and was identified as a significant risk factor in multivariate Cox regression. Subgroup revealed significant interactions of BUNCR trajectories with age and sepsis. Conclusions: Distinct BUNCR trajectories were significantly associated with ACM in critically ill HS patients. Persistently increasing BUNCR predicted the poorest outcomes, underscoring its potential as a dynamic biomarker for timely risk stratification and informed ICU decisions."
41303127,Diagnostic Utility of Monocyte Distribution Width for Early Sepsis Detection in Cancer-Enriched Emergency Cohort.,2025,"Background: Timely recognition of sepsis remains a critical clinical challenge, particularly in cancer patients, who are at higher risk due to immunosuppression. Monocyte distribution width (MDW) has emerged as a biomarker with potential utility in the early detection of sepsis. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 1167 patients who presented to the emergency department of a cancer specialty hospital in Republic of Korea. Patients were classified according to Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 criteria, and the diagnostic performance of MDW was compared with conventional biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on malignancy status, leukopenia, and initial signs of infection. Additionally, turnaround times (TATs) were compared among the biomarkers. Results: MDW demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of CRP and PCT for identifying sepsis and infection across both Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 criteria. In the context of diagnosing sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria, MDW yielded the highest area under the curve (0.869), sensitivity (91.0%), and negative predictive value (98%). Notably, in cancer patients, MDW maintained strong diagnostic reliability. It also demonstrated high diagnostic capability in patients with leukopenia or presenting with initial signs of infection. Moreover, the TAT was significantly shorter for MDW (median 59 min) than for CRP (105 min) or PCT (111 min). Conclusions: MDW is a rapid and accessible biomarker with demonstrated value for early sepsis detection in emergency settings. Its balanced diagnostic profile and consistent performance across diverse patient subgroups support its integration into routine clinical workflows, especially as part of multimodal sepsis screening strategies."
41302180,Guiding Antibiotic Therapy with Machine Learning: Real-World Applications of a CDSS in Bacteremia Management.,2025,"Bacteremia is a life-threatening condition contributing significantly to sepsis-related mortality worldwide. With delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy, mortality increases by 20% regardless of antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluated the perceived clinical utility of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) (OneChoice and OneChoice Fusion) among specialist physicians managing bacteremia cases. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 65 unique specialist physicians from multiple medical specialties who were presented with clinical vignettes describing patients with bacteremia and 90 corresponding AI-CDSS recommendations. Participants assessed the perceived helpfulness of AI decision-making, the impact of AI recommendations on their own clinical judgment, and the concordance between AI recommendations and their own clinical judgment, as well as the validity of changing therapy based on CDSS recommendations. The study encompassed a diverse range of bacterial pathogens, with Escherichia coli representing 38.7% of the isolates and 30% being extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Findings show that 97.8% [(95% CI: 92.2-99.7%)] of physicians reported that AI facilitated decision-making and substantial concordance (87.8% [95% CI: 79.2-93.7%; Cohen's kappa = 0.76]) between AI recommendations and physicians' therapeutic recommendations. Stratification by pathogen revealed the highest concordance for Escherichia coli bacteremia (96.6%, 28/29 cases). Implementation analysis revealed a meaningful clinical impact, with 68.9% [(95% CI: 58.3-78.2%)] of cases resulting in AI-guided treatment modifications. These findings indicate that AI-powered CDSSs effectively bridge critical gaps in infectious disease expertise and antimicrobial stewardship, providing clinicians with evidence-based therapeutic recommendations that can be integrated into routine practice to optimize antibiotic selection, particularly in settings with limited access to infectious disease specialists. For optimal clinical integration, we recommend that clinicians utilize AI-CDSS recommendations as an adjunct to clinical judgment rather than a replacement, particularly in complex cases involving immunocompromised hosts or polymicrobial infections. Future research should prioritize prospective clinical trials that evaluate direct patient outcomes to establish evidence of broader clinical effectiveness and applicability across diverse healthcare settings."
41302151,The Predictive Value of Umbilical Cord Interleukin-6: Implications for Neonatal Care-A Narrative Review of Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.,2025,"(1) Background: The assessment of neonatal health and prognosis is one of the most critical areas in pediatric medicine. Intrauterine inflammation and the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) are increasingly recognized as major determinants of neonatal morbidity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), measured in the umbilical cord (UC) blood, has emerged as a promising biomarker, reflecting both intrauterine conditions and early neonatal risk. This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence on the predictive value of umbilical cord blood IL-6 for neonatal outcome, including sepsis, respiratory distress, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and mortality. (2) Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies reporting umbilical cord IL-6 levels in relation to neonatal outcomes were analyzed and summarized narratively. (3) Results: Evidence consistently indicates that elevated umbilical cord IL-6 is associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and respiratory complications, and provides prognostic insight into neurological outcomes, even though results are influenced by gestational age (GA), mode of delivery, and the presence of chorioamnionitis. (4) Conclusions: UC IL-6 represents a valuable early biomarker for neonatal risk stratification and supports clinical decision-making. Future research should prioritize assay standardization, reference interval development, and prospective multicenter studies to validate its integration into routine neonatal care."
41301767,"Calprotectin, Azurocidin, and Interleukin-8: Neutrophil Signatures with Diagnostic and Prognostic Value in Sepsis.",2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and limited-resource countries. Despite over a century of research, accurate biomarkers for reliable diagnosis and prognosis in critically ill patients have yet to be established. Methods: This multicenter retrospective observational study aims to evaluate serum levels of Calprotectin, Azurocidin, cytokines, chemokines, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in 15 healthy volunteers (controls), 15 non-infectious SIRS patients, 92 alive septic patients (Sepsis_A) and 29 dead septic patients (Sepsis_D). Results: Most biomarkers showed significantly higher serum concentrations in septic patients compared with controls, with IL-4 being increased only in the Sepsis_D group. In addition, several markers, including Calprotectin, Azurocidin, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-35, were progressively elevated from SIRS to Sepsis_A and Sepsis_D cohorts, reflecting disease severity. All biomarkers showed good diagnostic performance for predicting Gram-negative bacteremia, although their accuracy in discriminating survivors from non-survivors was relatively low. Conclusions: In conclusion, calprotectin, azurocidin, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-35 may assist clinicians in identifying Gram-negative bacteremia in septic patients; however, their prognostic value appears to be limited."
41301751,"Early Diagnostic Markers and Risk Stratification in Sepsis: Prognostic Value of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, Platelets, and the Carmeli Score.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, where immune-inflammatory and thrombo-inflammation drive organ dysfunction. Early recognition of high-risk patients is essential. In addition, the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens complicates therapeutic strategies, as delays in appropriate antimicrobial therapy are strongly associated with poor outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study including 120 critically ill patients fulfilling Sepsis-3 criteria. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 48 h, and 72 h. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated from complete blood counts. At the same time, the Carmeli score was used as a surrogate for MDR infection risk. Prognostic accuracy was assessed using ROC curve analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Persistently elevated NLR at 72 h and a delayed decline in platelet counts were associated with higher mortality. NLR at 72 h showed good predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.765; 95% CI 0.668-0.863), and the combination of APACHE II and NLR improved prognostic performance (AUC = 0.827). Importantly, the Carmeli score, reflecting MDR infection risk, was an independent predictor of outcome, linking antimicrobial resistance risk with sepsis prognosis. Conclusions: Dynamic immune-inflammatory biomarkers (NLR, platelets), when integrated with MDR risk assessment through the Carmeli score, provide a simple and cost-effective strategy for early prognostic stratification in sepsis. This combined approach may help facilitate early therapeutic decisions and patient care triage."
41301539,Circulating microRNAs and Plasma Gelsolin as Biomarkers of Sepsis: Molecular Insights and Prospects for Precision Medicine.,2025,"Sepsis is a major medical emergency, characterized by a dysfunctional immune response to infection, which often progresses to multiple organ failure and death. Early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation present significant challenges due to limitations in the specificity and sensitivity of traditional biomarkers. This narrative review summarizes recent evidence on the potential of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-150, miR-146a, miR-223, miR-155, miR-122, and miR-4772-5p and plasma gelsolin (pGSN) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in sepsis. We discuss mechanisms involved and their potential for integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in personalized medicine. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature. Original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses focused on the diagnostic or prognostic value of circulating miRNAs or pGSN in sepsis were included; opinion papers and case reports were excluded. Altered expression of certain circulating microRNAs correlates with disease severity and mortality. Among circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-122 and miR-150 have become the most consistently validated biomarkers in clinical studies, associated with sepsis severity and death rates. Additionally, other miRNAs such as miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 play roles in modulating immune and endothelial responses, highlighting the complex regulation of sepsis pathophysiology. Low pGSN concentrations at admission are associated with severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and serve as an independent predictor of mortality. Preclinical studies suggest that supplementation with exogenous pGSN could increase survival. AI algorithms show promising results for early sepsis detection and optimization of therapeutic decisions. However, combining circulating miRNAs and plasma gelsolin (pGSN) into AI-based models is still an exploratory idea that needs prospective validation, assay standardization, and multicenter studies before it can be used clinically."
41301165,Enhancing Clinical Decision-Making in Pediatric Monitoring: Learning Threshold Alarm Patterns to Predict Critical Illness.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Patient monitors assist caregivers in identifying deterioration earlier by using threshold alarms. Not all of the threshold alarms necessitate immediate action, but some are a result of the triggering of a physiological event. We aim to use pattern recognition techniques to identify threshold alarm signal patterns before the onset of critical illness, thereby enabling the faster and more effective detection of clinical deterioration and supporting better clinical decision-making. METHOD: Secondary data from 774 pediatric patients were extracted from the IMPALA Project conducted in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at Queen Elizabeth and Zomba Central Hospitals in Malawi. The threshold alarm data were generated from the vital signs using WHO age cut-offs and GOAL3 age cut-offs. Time-segmented alarm analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of threshold alarms around each vital sign 8 h before the onset of critical illness events. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) was used to generate threshold alarm signal patterns for each signal per individual before the onset of a critical illness event. We used three machine learning approaches, random forest, support vector machine, and decision tree, to learn threshold alarm patterns in signals preceding critical illness events. RESULTS: The total threshold alarm summed up to (3,910,083) in total for WHO and (2,041,740) for GOAL3. Temporal distributions of ECGRR, ECGHR and oxygen saturation rate (SPO2) threshold alarms were observed, revealing patterns before the onset of the critical illness events. A pattern of most threshold alarms was distributed around (40-60) for ECGRR upper threshold alarms and (0-20) for ECGRR lower threshold alarms, (80-85) for ECGHR lower threshold alarms and (140-160) for ECGHR upper threshold alarms, and (85-90) for SPO2 for death (CPR and PICU), around WHO threshold alarms. For sepsis, most of these threshold alarms were distributed around (40-50) of ECGRR upper threshold alarms and (0-20) for ECGRR lower threshold alarms, (150-180) for ECGHR upper threshold alarms, and (85) for SPO2 for WHO threshold alarms, and most of the threshold alarms had a duration of less than 30 s. The results indicate that the random forest classifier performed better in learning the threshold patterns, with an accuracy of 93% and an area under the curve of 92, compared to using the support vector machine learning model and decision tree, which had an accuracy from a classification report of 85% and 94%, with low death and sepsis precision, recall, and F1-Score. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of threshold alarm data before critical illness events has provided valuable insights into threshold alarm patterns associated with death and sepsis. The data revealed distinct patterns in ECGRR, ECGHR, and SPO2 signals, and most of the threshold alarms were in the lower duration. The random forest classifier effectively distinguished these learned patterns around death and sepsis events compared to other algorithms. Further studies are required on the use of algorithms on all vital sign signal features in clinical settings."
41300951,The Interleukin Network in Sepsis: From Cytokine Storm to Clinical Applications.,2025,"Background and Objectives: Despite major advances in medical science and critical care, sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide: it arises from dysregulated host response to infections and may culminate in organ dysfunction. A hallmark of its pathogenesis is the cytokine storm, in which interleukins (ILs) serve as central mediators of both protective and deleterious immune responses. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of ILs in sepsis, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Material and Methods: We analyzed recent clinical and experimental studies focusing on the most studied ILs-including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-17-in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Attention was given to mechanistic insights, prognostic significance, and therapeutic strategies targeting IL pathways. Results: IL-1 and IL-6 emerged as key pro-inflammatory mediators, amplifying vascular permeability, coagulation activation, and shock, with IL-6 validated as a robust prognostic biomarker. IL-10 was identified as a pivotal anti-inflammatory cytokine, limiting tissue injury but fostering immunosuppression and secondary infections. Other ILs, such as IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-17, contributed to neutrophil recruitment, Th1/Th17 activation, organ-specific injury, and sepsis susceptibility. Therapeutic interventions targeting ILs, including the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab, have shown promise in selected patient subgroups. Conclusions: ILs are central to the immunopathology of sepsis, acting both as drivers of hyperinflammation and mediators of immunosuppression. Their dual role underscores the relevance of ILs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as context-dependent therapeutic targets. Future approaches should prioritize precision immunomodulation aligned with the principles of personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes in sepsis."
41300910,Research Progress on Sepsis Diagnosis and Monitoring Based on Omics Technologies: A Review.,2025,"Sepsis poses a significant global health burden, with millions of cases and high mortality rates annually, largely due to challenges in early diagnosis and monitoring. Traditional methods, reliant on nonspecific clinical manifestations and limited biomarkers like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, often fail to distinguish infection from non-infectious inflammation or capture disease heterogeneity. This review synthesizes recent progress in omics technologies-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-for advancing sepsis management. Genomics, via metagenomic next-generation sequencing, enables rapid pathogen identification and genetic variant analysis for susceptibility and prognosis. Transcriptomics reveals molecular subtypes and immune dynamics through RNA sequencing and single-cell approaches. Proteomics and metabolomics uncover protein and metabolite profiles linked to immune imbalance, organ damage, and metabolic disorders. Multi-omics integration, enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning, facilitates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and predictive modeling, bridging laboratory findings to bedside applications like rapid diagnostic tools and clinical decision support systems. Despite advancements, challenges including data heterogeneity, high costs, and ethical concerns persist. Future directions emphasize single-cell and spatial omics, AI-driven personalization, and ethical frameworks to transform sepsis care from reactive to proactive, ultimately improving outcomes."
41300689,MicroRNA Profiling as a Novel Tool in the Diagnostics of Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Scoping Review.,2025,"Background/Objectives: The incidence of late-onset sepsis (LOS) has increased with improved survival rates in premature infants. Blood culture, the diagnostic ""gold standard"", requires at least 36-72 h for results, leading to empiric antibiotic use and potential resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for sepsis in adults, but their role in neonatal LOS remains unclear. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the miRNA expression profiles of bacterial LOS in neonates. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was performed between 1 November 2023 and 31 December 2024. Results: Twelve studies fulfilled our criteria and were included in the review. Despite the considerable heterogeneity among the studies, most focused on detecting and quantifying serum microRNAs using real-time PCR, while some examined correlations with other biomarkers, such as CRP. The few microRNAs identified as common across multiple studies showed similar patterns of regulation in LOS cases. Compared to controls (no LOS), neonates with LOS exhibited significant alterations in miRNA expression. More precisely, in LOS, miRNA-181a, miRNA-23b, miRNA-181b5p, miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-34a5p, miRNA-199a3p, miRNA-1184 and miRNA-1295p were downregulated, while miRNA-16, miRNA-146a, miRNA-101, miRNA-187, miRNA-21, miRNA-15a/16 and miRNA-455-5p were upregulated. Conclusions: Currently, there is limited data regarding miRNA expression in LOS. Many studies showed altered expression of specific miRNAs in septic neonates; however, these observations need further validation in larger cohorts and/or randomized controlled trials to confirm their diagnostic potential."
41299676,ICOSL: more than a trigger of ICOS function.,2025,"Inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) and its ligand ICOSL are members of the CD28 and B7 receptor families that play central roles in immune regulation. While the role of ICOS in T-cell activation and differentiation has been widely studied, increasing evidence indicates that ICOSL, which is broadly expressed across both immune and nonimmune cell types, also functions as a signaling receptor. This review focuses on ICOSL-mediated reverse signaling and its ability to modulate the behavior of ICOSL-expressing immune and stromal cells. In vitro, ICOSL activation induces cell type-specific responses, most notably regulating cell migration. In vivo, ICOSL signaling influences key processes such as tumor growth, bone remodeling, wound healing, liver regeneration, and sepsis. Taken together, these findings expand the conventional view of ICOSL as a passive ligand and suggest that ICOSL is a versatile immune modulator with therapeutic relevance in cancer, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases."
41299319,Association between serum uric acid to serum creatinine ratio and in-hospital mortality in patients with severe acute pancreatitis: a retrospective study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Serum uric acid/creatinine (SUA/Cr) can reflect the metabolic status of the body. However, the effect of SUA/Cr on the prognosis of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SUA/Cr on in-hospital mortality in SAP patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective study involving 224 SAP patients admitted to the ICU of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from January 2020 to April 2024. The primary outcome for patient inclusion was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome include acute kidney injury (AKI), liver dysfunction, sepsis, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, bacteremia, septicemia, respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), etc. The data on serum uric acid and serum creatinine were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 software. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to determine the cutoff value of SUA/Cr. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between SUA/Cr and in-hospital mortality in SAP patients. RESULTS: A total of the 224 SAP patients included in the study, 88 (39.3%) had low SUA/Cr, while 136 (61.7%) had high SUA/Cr. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in survival, AKI, sepsis, septic shock, septicemia, MODS, ICU days, and length of hospital stay (P < 0.001). Models I, II and III of in-hospital mortality in SAP patients adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), sex, diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, respectively. The results of model I showed that the OR of SUA was 1.002 (P = 0.601), and SCR was 1.009 (P = 0.027). In Model II, compared with the high SUA/Cr group, the OR of the low group was 8.027 (95%CI:1.447-14.511, P = 0.017). In Model III, SUA/Cr OR was 0.456 (95%CI: 0.239-0.872, P = 0.018). Meanwhile, age, BMI, APACHE-II scores, and mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for death in SAP patients. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that SAP patients in the low SUA/Cr group have worse prognosis and higher in-hospital mortality, and low SUA/Cr is independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. SUA/Cr may serve as a prognostic biomarker for SAP patients."
41299255,Differential protein expression and enriched pathways in pediatric sepsis: identification of novel brain-associated biomarkers revealed through proteomic profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, defined by confirmed or suspected infection with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, requires robust biomarker identification. Proteomics enables protein quantification and expression analysis across disease states. This study investigated differential protein expression patterns, particularly brain-associated proteins, between sepsis patients and healthy controls, while evaluating temporal variations and relevant molecular pathways. METHODS: Study participants were prospectively enrolled based on established pediatric sepsis criteria with clinical and blood samples collected. Plasma protein concentrations were quantified using Nucleic Acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay methodology. Statistical analyses incorporated conventional statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. RESULTS: The study cohorts comprised 23 age- and sex-matched participants: pediatric sepsis patients (median 11 years, IQR 9.5-14) and healthy controls (median 11 years, IQR 7.8-13; P = 0.809). Analyses revealed 59 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) on Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Day 1 (PICU D1). Random Forest Classification (RFC) with Boruta feature selection identified 29 proteins that facilitated distinct group stratification. Comparison between PICU D1 and D3 samples yielded 34 DEPs, with RFC and Boruta feature selection isolating 9 discriminatory proteins. Multiple proteins were correlated with PELOD-2 scores and mortality (P < 0.05). Novel brain-associated proteins demonstrated significant differential expression patterns between PICU D1 and healthy controls, and over 3 days of PICU stay in sepsis patients. PICU D1 samples demonstrated significant pathway upregulation when compared to healthy controls, including ""Signaling by Interleukins"", ""Cytokine Signaling in Immune system"", and ""Interleukin-10 signaling"". By PICU D3, pathways associated with ""Generic Transcription Pathway"", ""RNA Polymerase II Transcription"", and ""Gene expression (Transcription)"" exhibited significant downregulation. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed TNF and IL1B as critical bridging proteins linking inflammatory and neurological processes. Disease enrichment analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of respiratory pathology-associated genes, with respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome as the most enriched categories. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation revealed distinct proteomic signatures in inflammatory and transcriptional pathways, including brain-associated processes, that differentiated pediatric sepsis patients from healthy control participants and exhibited temporal dynamics. The identification of TNF and IL1B as bridging proteins between systemic inflammation and neurological processes, combined with respiratory-centric disease enrichment patterns, provides mechanistic insights into sepsis pathophysiology. These alterations may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated encephalopathy and lingering cognitive impairment in sepsis survivors, warranting further investigation in future studies. The identified molecular signatures present potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pediatric sepsis management.

41299237,Prognostic value of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been utilized as a prognostic indicator for sepsis patients; however, the findings have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis seeks to elucidate the prognostic significance of MCP-1 in individuals diagnosed with sepsis. METHODS: We systematically queried four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) to identify studies published from the establishment of the databases until January 2025. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were employed to evaluate the prognostic significance of MCP-1 in this patient population. In our study, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was evaluated for quality assessment, and Funnel plot was used for publication offset. RESULTS: A total of 592 patients from eight studies were included in the evaluation. The findings revealed that MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to those who survived [SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.25-0.82, P = 0.0002]. Our study demonstrated that elevated levels of MCP-1 were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with sepsis, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-1.48; P < 0.00001) using a random-effects model. The funnel plot indicated no publication bias. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that elevated levels of MCP-1 could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator in sepsis patients, however, this conclusion still requires validation through higher-quality studies with longer-term follow-up."
41298591,Inflammatory response in bacteremia survivors and non-survivors: a case-control study.,2025,"Survival in bacteremia is influenced by host comorbidities, pathogen virulence, immune response, and the quality of medical care. A deeper understanding of host inflammatory responses may help identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes. In this study, we analyzed plasma samples from adult patients with bacteremia who presented to the emergency department. Patients who died within seven days (n = 44) were compared to matched survivors (n = 44) who lived at least 90 days, with matching based on age, sex, and causative bacterium. Relative concentrations of 92 inflammation-related plasma proteins were measured using the proximity extension assay (Olink Proteomics AB). Of these, 82 proteins were successfully quantified. Thirty proteins, including IL-20RA, CD40, and HGF, were significantly elevated in non-survivors, while three proteins-IFNG, Flt3L, and TNFB-were significantly reduced. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed activation of multiple proinflammatory signaling cascades in non-survivors, particularly those involving IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17. Logistic regression identified HGF, IL-17 C, and Flt3L as key discriminative proteins between groups. These findings indicate that the host inflammatory profile in bacteremia differs markedly between survivors and early non-survivors. Our results highlight potential diagnostic biomarkers for identifying high-risk patients and point to promising therapeutic targets in the management of bacteremia."
41297233,Discriminative power of organ-specific SOFA assessment in burn sepsis: A temporal biomarker analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Severe burn patients face diagnostic challenges in distinguishing sepsis from systemic inflammation using Sepsis-3 criteria. Current Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) validation studies focus on composite scores, neglecting subsystem-level analysis in burn-specific pathophysiology. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 55 severe burn patients (TBSA>30 %) from a Chinese burn center (2021-2022), comparing 19 sepsis cases with 36 controls. We analyzed SOFA subsystems and biomarkers (creatinine, platelet count, NT-proBNP, and PCT) during both the early phase (days 1 and 3 post-burn) and the late phase (after day 3 post-burn), performed TBSA-adjusted logistic regression, and constructed a nomogram. RESULTS: Cardiovascular (84.2 % vs 2.8 %, p < 0.001), renal (31.6 % vs 0 %, p < 0.001), and coagulation (42.1 % vs 5.6 %, p < 0.001) subsystems showed superior diagnostic specificity. Platelet trajectories revealed critical divergence at day 3 (septic: 66 vs control: 120 x10(9)/L, p < 0.001), while creatinine elevation persisted across phases (day 1: 100 vs 62 mumol/L, p < 0.001, day 3: 84 vs 65 mumol/L, and late phase: 118 vs 58mumol/L, p < 0.001). PCT demonstrated isolated diagnostic utility confined to the late phase (6.12 vs 0.55 mug/L, p < 0.001). Day 3 platelet count, late-phase creatinine, and PCT were incorporated into the nomogram, which achieved an AUC of 0.930 in ROC analysis. CONCLUSION: Subsystem-specific SOFA analysis identifies creatinine elevation and thrombocytopenia as key sepsis indicators in burns. Serial platelet and creatinine monitoring from day 3 post-injury enhances early detection, while PCT demonstrates diagnostic utility only in the late phase. A clinically applicable nomogram was developed to predict sepsis risk. These findings suggest that these specific organ systems are the principal contributors to the SOFA score in burn-related sepsis."
41296392,Research Progress on Signalling Pathways Related to Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury in Children.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a prevalent and life-threatening complication in critically ill children, contributing to high mortality rates (up to 30%) and long-term renal dysfunction in pediatric intensive care units. This review synthesizes recent advances in the signalling pathways underlying SA-AKI, emphasizing pediatric-specific mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. This review covers inflammatory cascades via TLR/NF-kappaB leading to cytokine storms (IL-6, TNF-alpha); apoptosis and necrosis involving mitochondrial Bcl-2 dysregulation and OLFM4; and emerging processes like pyroptosis (NF-kappaB-mediated), metabolic reprogramming (choline deficiency and Nrf2-mitophagy), and novel routes such as cGAS-STING and TGF-beta signalling. Biomarkers like urinary OLFM4, DKK3, NGAL, and serum suPAR, alanine, and Penkid enable early diagnosis and risk stratification, with models like PERSEVERE-II enhancing prognostic accuracy. Therapeutic strategies include fluid optimization, renal replacement therapies (CRRT, SLED-f), and pathway-targeted interventions such as choline supplementation, oXiris for cytokine removal, Humanin for immunomodulation, and investigational cGAS-STING inhibitors. Despite progress, challenges persist in translating animal models to pediatric trials and addressing heterogeneity. Integrating multi-omics and precision medicine holds promise for improving outcomes, underscoring the need for multicenter studies in children."
41296074,Sepsis and heatstroke: overlapping and distinct mechanisms of systemic inflammation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and heatstroke, although arising from microbial infection or environmental heat exposure, converge upon similar pathophysiological systemic inflammatory responses that include immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial injury, and multiorgan failure. Despite this overlap, important mechanistic differences, especially in the initiating triggers and immune response dynamics, distinguish their clinical manifestations and therapeutic strategies. FINDINGS: Sepsis is initiated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptors, whereas heatstroke stems from the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in response to thermal injury. Both syndromes disrupt mitochondrial integrity, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, an excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the release of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome C, which further amplify inflammation and promote cell death. Leukocytes undergo diverse forms of death-including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis-compounding immune dysfunction. Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation are prevalent in both conditions, driven by endothelial injury, platelet activation, and NET formation, although microbial toxins intensify this response in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This review synthesizes current evidence to delineate the converging and diverging pathways of sepsis and heatstroke, with a focus on mitochondrial injury, immune paralysis, and thromboinflammation. We also explore emerging biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, including mitochondrial stabilizers and modulators of cell death. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms can inform precision medicine strategies and improve outcomes in both syndromes."
41295242,"From Data to Decisions: Harnessing Multi-Agent Systems for Safer, Smarter, and More Personalized Perioperative Care.",2025,"Background/Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied across the perioperative continuum, with potential benefits in efficiency, personalization, and patient safety. Unfortunately, most such tools are developed in isolation, limiting their clinical utility. Multi-Agent Systems for Healthcare (MASH), in which autonomous AI agents coordinate tasks across multiple domains, may provide the necessary framework for integrated perioperative care. This critical review synthesizes current AI applications in anesthesiology and considers their integration within a MASH architecture. This is the first review to advance MASH as a conceptual and practical framework for anesthesiology, uniquely contributing to the AI discourse by proposing its potential to unify isolated innovations into adaptive and collaborative systems. Methods: A critical review was conducted using PubMed and Google Search to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025. The search strategy combined controlled vocabulary and free-text terms for AI, anesthesiology, perioperative care, critical care, and pain management. Results were filtered for randomized controlled trials and clinical trials. Data were extracted and organized by perioperative phase. Results: The 16 studies (6 from database search, 10 from prior work) included in this review demonstrated AI applications across the perioperative timeline. Preoperatively, predictive models such as POTTER improved surgical risk stratification. Intraoperative trials evaluated systems like SmartPilot and Navigator, enhancing anesthetic dosing and physiologic stability. In critical care, algorithms including NAVOY Sepsis and VentAI supported early detection of sepsis and optimized ventilatory management. In pain medicine, AI assisted with opioid risk assessment and individualized pain-control regimens. While these trials demonstrated clinical utility, most applications remain domain-specific and unconnected from one another. Conclusions: AI has broad potential to improve perioperative care, but its impact depends on coordinated deployment. MASH offers a unifying framework to integrate diverse agents into adaptive networks, enabling more personalized anesthetic care that is safer and more efficient."
41295239,"Identifying Risk Groups in 73,000 Patients with Diabetes Receiving Total Hip Replacement: A Machine Learning Clustering Analysis.",2025,"Background/Objective: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent condition that contributes to adverse outcomes in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study applied machine learning clustering algorithms to identify comorbidity profiles among diabetic THA patients and evaluate their association with postoperative outcomes. Methods: The 2015-2021 National Inpatient Sample was queried using ICD-10 CM/PCS codes to identify DM patients undergoing THA. Forty-nine comorbidities, complications, and clinical covariates were incorporated into clustering analysis. The Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices determined the optimal number of clusters. Multivariate logistic regression assessed risk of non-routine discharge (NRD), and Kruskal-Wallis H testing evaluated length-of-stay (LOS) differences. Results: A total of 73,606 patients were included. Six clusters were identified, ranging from 107 to 61,505 patients. Cluster 6, enriched for urinary tract infection and sepsis, had the highest risk of NRD (OR 7.83, p < 0.001) and the longest median LOS (9.0 days). Clusters 1-4 had shorter recoveries with median LOS of 2.0 days and narrow variability, while Cluster 5 showed intermediate outcomes. Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc testing confirmed significant differences across clusters (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Machine learning clustering of diabetic THA patients revealed six distinct groups with varied comorbidity profiles. Infection-driven clusters carried the highest risk for non-routine discharge and prolonged hospitalization. This approach provides a novel framework for risk stratification and may inform targeted perioperative management strategies."
41294727,NanoArrayPAD-X: Nanoprobe Array and 3D-microPAD for the Simultaneous Detection of Respiratory Pathogens and Biomarkers at the Point of Care.,2025,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs) are ideal for point-of-care diagnostics due to their low cost, compact size, and ease of use. However, current designs have limited multiplexing capabilities, making it difficult to simultaneously detect pathogens and biomarkers in the same sample. In this work, we introduce NanoArrayPAD-X, a novel microPAD design that combines wax-printed microfluidic networks with an array of nanoprobes for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. This is achieved by distributing the sample through the microfluidic network containing X detection areas. There, targets are captured through physical interactions and recognized by specific antibody-coated nanoprobes released from the nanoprobe array. This generates X dots whose color depends on the concentration of the targets in the sample. A NanoArrayPAD-5 platform capable of detecting five targets was developed to aid in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sensor array could detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and the inflammatory biomarker myeloperoxidase (MPO) with a total turnaround time of 25 min, which is faster than waiting for an overnight culture and the results of an ELISA. Notably, our prototype successfully detected the targets in 87 bronchial aspirate (BAS) specimens, thus demonstrating the suitability of the platform for analyzing complex samples with sputum-like qualities. These findings establish NanoArrayPAD-X as a promising tool for the rapid, multiplexed screening of respiratory pathogens and biomarkers, with potential for guiding personalized antimicrobial therapy in suspected cases of nosocomial pneumonia."
41294166,The difference in hematocrit and albumin levels and the risk of sepsis for patients with acute pancreatitis: a retrospective cohort study based on the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a major cause of gastrointestinal hospitalization, with an annual global incidence of 3.07%. Severe AP develops in up to 20% of cases, with sepsis occurring in 40-70% of such cases, leading to higher mortality. The early detection of sepsis is crucial. Hematocrit (HCT) and albumin (ALB) levels are individually linked to sepsis. Their combined measure, HCT-ALB, indicates blood and nutritional health. HCT-ALB can predict sepsis and infection outcomes; however, its effectiveness in treating AP-related sepsis has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between HCT-ALB values and sepsis risk in patients with AP. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Medical Information Market for Intensive Care IV database data. The primary outcome was the risk of sepsis in patients with AP. The HCT-ALB value refers to the difference between HCT and ALB levels, which we categorized into three groups according to quantiles: < 0.5, 0.5-7.6, and >/= 7.6. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between HCT-ALB values and sepsis. The predictive value of HCT-ALB was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Subgroup analyses were conducted for different subgroups. RESULTS: Among 565 patients with AP, 163 developed sepsis. In the multivariable model, HCT-ALB >/= 7.60 was associated with sepsis risk for patients with AP [odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-3.14]. The area under the curve (AUC) value of HCT-ALB in predicting sepsis risk among patients with AP was 0.599 (95% CI 0.544-0.654), which was higher than that of the bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis score (AUC 0.558, 95% CI 0.509-0.607). Subgroup analysis showed that HCT-ALB was only related to sepsis risk in male patients with acute kidney injury and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment in < 2 subgroups. CONCLUSION: HCT-ALB values >/= 7.6 were associated with increased sepsis risk in patients with AP. HCTALB may contribute to identifying the risk of sepsis in patients with AP."
41293879,Quantification of Candida spp. using fluorescence and SERS spectroscopy for bloodstream infection diagnosis.,2025,"Bloodstream infections caused by Candida spp. are among the leading hospital-acquired infections, but their diagnosis remains slow and challenging with conventional culture-based methods, which often require days to deliver results. This study aimed to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic strategy for the detection and quantification of Candida spp. directly from blood samples. We designed a workflow combining antibody-modified magnetic beads for pathogen isolation, magnetic SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering)-encoded tags for multiplexed detection, and fluorescence microscopy for rapid prescreening. Data analysis was automated using machine learning, including convolutional neural networks for image classification and self-organizing maps for spectral analysis. This method enabled the detection and quantification of seven clinically relevant Candida species (C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. auris, C. haemulonii, C. dubliniensis, and C. parapsilosis) in 7.5 mL of whole blood at septicemia-relevant concentrations as low as 2 CFU mL(-1), with the results obtained in 4-5 hours. High specificity was demonstrated, with minimal cross-reactivity against bacterial controls. This integrated approach represents a rapid, sensitive, and multiplex alternative to current diagnostics, with the potential to improve the early detection and targeted treatment of candidemia, thereby enhancing the clinical outcomes and reducing the healthcare burden."
41293540,"Serum-soluble SDC1 in septic patients is rich in heparan sulfate, which affects the ELISA quantification values.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Soluble syndecan (sSDC) 1, which is released into the blood by shedding of the SDC1 ectodomain, is a potent biomarker of various inflammatory diseases and cancers. However, the characteristics of serum sSDC1 and methods for its quantification have not been thoroughly investigated. We investigated the properties of sSDC1 in the serum of patients with sepsis and their effects on measurement values. METHODS: Serum sSDC1 levels in patients with and without sepsis were determined using dot blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The molecular characteristics of serum sSDC1 were evaluated using western blotting and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Serum sSDC1 ELISA values were more clearly able to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients than dot blot intensities. Serum sSDC1 mainly exists as the derivatives of the SDC1 ectodomain with molecular masses of 150-200 and 75 kDa, which were more prevalent in septic patients than non-septic patients. The former derivatives showed significant susceptibility to heparinase III. The presence of high-molecular-weight sSDC1 (>200 kDa), immunoprecipitated with an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody, was also characteristic of the serum of patients with sepsis. The 150-200 and 75 kDa forms may have been derived from this high-molecular-weight HS-rich sSDC1. Importantly, the serum sSDC1 ELISA values for patients with sepsis showed a significant increase after treatment with heparinase III. CONCLUSIONS: sSDC1 molecules generated by sepsis-induced pathological shedding may be rich in HS and heterogeneous compared to those generated by physiological shedding. The HS content affected the ELISA quantification values of serum sSDC1."
41293242,Recent advances in understanding oxidative stress in sepsis: pathogenic roles and antioxidant therapeutic prospects - a narrative review.,2025,"Sepsis remains a major global health challenge, exerting a particularly severe toll in low- and middle-income countries. Despite advances in antimicrobial and supportive care, sepsis continues to defy effective control due to its complex pathophysiology and multi-organ involvement. Central to this complexity is a dysregulated host response, driven by hyperinflammation, immune suppression, and profound mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction. A critical mediator of this dysregulation is oxidative stress, which exacerbates cellular injury through reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, disrupting mitochondrial integrity and redox balance. This review synthesizes current insights into the mechanistic interplay between oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunopathology in sepsis. It further evaluates the therapeutic potential of endogenous antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione, as well as exogenous agents including vitamins A, C, E, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, and carnosine. While translational gaps persist, particularly in dosing, timing, and patient stratification, emerging strategies including mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, nanotherapeutics, and biomarker-guided interventions hold promise for restoring redox homeostasis and improving clinical outcomes. This review aims to serve as a contemporary resource for researchers and clinicians striving to decode the oxidative basis of sepsis and accelerate the development of precision antioxidant therapies."
41293058,The accuracy of heparin-binding protein and interleukin-6 in predicting prognosis of severe pneumonia with sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early warning is critical for improving prognosis in patients with severe pneumonia-induced sepsis. Conventional biomarkers and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score have notable limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of serum heparin-binding protein (HBP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), assess their correlation with clinical outcomes, and compare their predictive performance against traditional biomarkers and the SOFA score. METHODS: A total of 171 patients with severe pneumonia complicated by sepsis were enrolled and stratified into survivor (n=96) and non-survivor (n=75) groups based on 28-day mortality. Baseline characteristics, including demographic data, comorbidities, and laboratory markers-HBP, IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate (Lac)-as well as SOFA scores, were collected upon admission. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. Predictive accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with pairwise comparisons of area under the curve (AUC) conducted via DeLong's test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the association between biomarker levels and organ dysfunction severity. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. RESULT: Non-survivors had significantly higher HBP, IL-6, PCT, CRP, Lac, and SOFA scores than survivors (all P<0.05). IL-6 was markedly elevated in blood culture-positive patients (P<0.05), suggesting value in detecting bloodstream infections. Multivariate analysis confirmed HBP (OR = 1.006, 95% CI:1.002-1.011), IL-6 (OR = 1.004, 95% CI:1.001-1.007), and SOFA score (OR = 1.026, 95% CI:1.145-1.484) as independent prognostic factors (all P<0.05). ROC analysis showed IL-6 had the highest AUC (0.80), followed by SOFA (0.78) and HBP (0.73), with no significant AUC differences between IL-6 and SOFA (P = 0.719) or HBP and CRP/PCT (both P>0.05). Optimal cut-offs were 55.90 ng/mL for HBP (sensitivity 82.7%, specificity 53.1%) and 32.62 pg/mL for IL-6 (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 69.8%). HBP correlated strongest with SOFA (r=0.60, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum HBP and IL-6 have comparable predictive efficacy to SOFA score and are numerically superior to PCT, CRP, and Lac. IL-6 also aids early identification of bloodstream infections. However, their cut-offs are from a single-center cohort and require external validation; combined use with SOFA score is recommended clinically."
41292579,Improving Sepsis Mortality Prediction With Machine Learning Using Full Region Synthetic Sampling Approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and remains a leading cause of mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Accurate mortality prediction is crucial for optimizing ICU resource allocation. However, severe class imbalance in ICU datasets hampers the generalization performance of machine learning models. METHODS: This study proposes a Full Region Synthetic Sampling Approach (FRSSA), a novel data augmentation method that dynamically balances the minority class distribution based on regional density. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Tuning (ASST), an optimization-based strategy that adjusts augmentation weights to enhance model performance. To evaluate model fairness and clinical utility, we propose the Balanced Performance Score (BPS), which integrates accuracy, precision, and recall for personalized ICU risk assessment. Also, we compare two augmentation strategies: (1) Pre-Splitting: Augmentation occurs before data set splitting, and (2) Post-Splitting: Augmentation is applied only to the training set to ensure fair evaluation. We utilize publicly available ICU datasets from both the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases and evaluate the performance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models, with hyperparameters optimized using RandomizedSearchCV on the training set. RESULTS: The Pre-Splitting strategy achieved 89.64% accuracy and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.968, but posed a risk of test-set contamination. In contrast, the Post-Splitting strategy yielded 78.31% accuracy and an AUROC of 0.7241, ensuring better real-world generalization. The ASST mechanism optimally balanced 65% interpolation (FRSSA) and 35% expansion (FRSSA), reducing false positive rates and enhancing model fairness. CONCLUSION: FRSSA preserves regional data distribution by generating synthetic samples near the imbalanced regions. ASST dynamically adjusts augmentation ratios to maximize classification performance and generalization. The BPS score-fusion metric offers a flexible evaluation framework, accommodating varying clinical priorities in ICU settings. Our findings demonstrate that Post-Splitting augmentation with FRSSA and ASST produces a fairer and more reliable ICU mortality prediction model."
41291942,TIGRIS and EUPHRATES eventually join and provide new evidence: a narrative review of the polymyxin B hemoperfusion.,2025,"Septic shock driven by endotoxemia is associated with high mortality despite advances in supportive care. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) selectively removes circulating endotoxin and has shown variable efficacy in randomized trials. While earlier studies, such as EUPHAS, suggested benefit, subsequent trials, including ABDO-MIX and EUPHRATES, yielded neutral results, partly due to heterogeneous patient selection. The recently completed TIGRIS trial addressed these limitations by enrolling septic shock patients with intermediate endotoxin activity (EAA: 0.60-0.89) and high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS > 9) using a Bayesian design. In 151 evaluable patients, PMX-HP achieved the primary endpoint, with a 95.3% posterior probability of 28-day survival benefit (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.67; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 6.4%). At 90 days, mortality reduction was greater (ARR: 17.4%; adjusted OR: 0.54; > 99% posterior probability of benefit), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 8.1. These results support the targeted use of PMX-HP in a biomarker-defined subgroup and may facilitate broader regulatory approval."
41290778,Serum zinc dynamics as a diagnostic and immunomodulatory biomarker in neonatal sepsis.,2025,"This study aimed to investigate serum zinc levels in term neonates with sepsis, evaluate its correlation with immune parameters, and assess zinc's diagnostic efficacy in identifying neonatal sepsis. A prospective cohort study was conducted, involving two groups: 52 neonates diagnosed with sepsis who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of our hospital between January 2022 and June 2023, and 50 healthy controls matched for gestational age and birth weight. Serum zinc levels, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in both cohorts. No statistically significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between the sepsis group (n = 52) and the healthy controls group (n = 50). Neonates with sepsis exhibited significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to controls (52.6 +/- 17.4 microg/dL vs. 83.2 +/- 21.4 microg/dL, P < 0.05), alongside markedly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], interleukin-10 [IL-10], and interleukin-12 [IL-12]). Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant associations: serum zinc levels showed a strong negative correlation with IL-6 (r = -0.510, P < 0.05) and IL-8 (r = -0.625, P < 0.05), while a positive correlation was observed with IL-12 (r = 0.627, P < 0.05). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated serum zinc's moderate diagnostic utility for neonatal sepsis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.812, P < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 76.9%, respectively. These findings highlight zinc's potential role in sepsis pathophysiology and diagnostic utility, despite its inferior performance compared to CRP (AUC = 0.865, P < 0.0001). Our findings demonstrate an inverse correlation between serum zinc levels and inflammatory response intensity in neonatal sepsis. Zinc deficiency may serve as a diagnostic biomarker, given its significant negative association with pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) and its moderate predictive accuracy for disease detection."
41290495,"Artificial intelligence in neonatal sepsis: Scope, challenges, and potential solutions!",2026,"Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths globally. Despite advances, accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by the limited performance of the current clinical approaches, imperfect laboratory biomarkers, and long turnaround time of blood cultures. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its ability to identify patterns and learn continuously (machine learning), seems promising. Basic steps in model development include data filtration, train: test split, feature selection, choosing appropriate algorithms, and evaluating performance using a reference standard. In neonatal sepsis, the role of AI spans from predicting sepsis and related outcomes to formulating an individualized treatment approach for the neonate. Existing models, largely from high-income countries, report encouraging diagnostic accuracy but face methodological limitations, lack external validation, and remain somewhat distant from bedside application. Additional barriers to their generalizability include lack of uniform definition of sepsis, variations in disease and pathogen profiles in different settings (particularly in developing countries), availability of electronic health data, tweaks in feature selection, and ethical and legal challenges. This review synthesizes current evidence, highlights gaps, and outlines priorities for future research. We call for a collaborative effort from AI and neonatal experts to devise robust, context-specific solutions."
41289621,A review on pathological implications and therapeutic interventions of sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a serious form of acute cerebral dysfunction that is seen in the ICU and is characterised by high mortality and long-term neuropsychiatric disabilities. This condition is not caused by a direct central nervous system infection; instead, it develops through a complex cascade of the systemic inflammatory response involving cytokine release, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Since there are no approved drugs that specifically protect the brain during the development of SAE, natural and synthetic compounds that modulate a variety of target sites offer a highly attractive therapeutic option. This review integrates preclinical findings from rodent models of SAE induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cecal-ligation-and-puncture (CLP) models. The findings suggest that certain plant-derived phytochemicals, along with various investigational agents, have effective neuroprotective activity and target the complex pathophysiology of SAE in a multi-faceted manner. These bioactive compounds efficiently suppress neuroinflammatory responses, the production of reactive species, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and apoptosis of neuronal cells in these experimental models. These data firmly suggest that the multi-target nature of these molecules makes them highly appropriate for the treatment of SAE. Extensive translational research is now required to confirm these promising findings in human septic patient populations."
41288863,Early diagnosis of bloodstream infections by Neutrophil-Reactive Intensity (NEUT-RI): a retrospective analysis.,2025,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are serious conditions caused by the presence of microorganisms in the blood. Although blood culture remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is time-consuming. Neutrophil activation plays a central role in the early immune response to infection and can be quantified using the Neutrophil-Reactive Intensity (NEUT-RI) parameter, derived from hematological analyzer using the fluorescence flow cytometry technology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate NEUT-RI as an early marker of BSI and compare its diagnostic performance with standard infection biomarkers. We conducted a retrospective study involving 120 inpatients with documented BSI. Each inpatient underwent blood testing for PCT (Procalcitonin), serum CRP (C-Reactive Protein), WBCs (White Blood Cells), neutrophil absolute count within 12 h prior to blood culture sampling. NEUT-RI values were retrieved from the complete blood count. A control group of 52 inpatients with negative blood cultures was also analyzed. Median NEUT-RI was significantly higher in BSI patients than in controls (53.43 FI vs 48.65 FI; p < 0.001). ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis showed an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.785 for NEUT-RI, with 72.5% sensitivity and 76.9% specificity at a cut-off of 50.7 FI. Only Procalcitonin (AUC 0.882) outperformed NEUT-RI (p = 0.01). Our findings suggest that NEUT-RI increases in the early stages of bacteremia and may serve as a useful early indicator of bloodstream infection. NEUT-RI could be integrated into multi-parametric diagnostic algorithms to improve early detection of BSIs. Further studies are warranted to validate these preliminary results."
41288437,Diagnostic Accuracy of Presepsin for Early Diagnosis of Sepsis in Critically Ill Obstetrics Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a significant maternal health issue; presepsin (sCD14-ST) has emerged as a novel biomarker for diagnosis of sepsis. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin for prediction of sepsis in critically ill obstetric patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in the Obstetrics Intensive Care Unit (ICU), over 18-month duration, involving 156 critically ill obstetric patients. Biomarkers including presepsin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and total leukocyte count (TLC) were measured on day 1 and day 3 of ICU admission. Presepsin was measured in serum sample by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using ELISA kit. RESULTS: 44.9% critically ill obstetrics patients developed sepsis in ICU. The most common comorbidity was acute kidney injury (AKI; 20.0%), and AKI was 28.5% in septic patients. Maternal death occurred in 17.9%, with a significantly higher mortality among those who had sepsis (32.9%) compared to those without sepsis (5.8%). Presepsin levels significantly increased from day 1 value of 260 pg/mL to day 3 value of 350 pg/ml, after the development of sepsis ( P < 0.001). Those who did not develop sepsis (controls) levels were decreased. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed presepsin had good diagnostic accuracy for prediction of sepsis presepsin at a cutoff value of >/=245 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 80.0%, at the area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.892, with confidence interval of 95% (AUC day 3 > day 1). Presepsin outperformed CRP and TLC in early sepsis detection. CONCLUSION: Presepsin is a reliable early marker for sepsis in critically ill obstetric patients, with better diagnostic accuracy than CRP and TLC. Its serial monitoring may offer valuable prognostic insight."
41287109,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts mortality for sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis often leads to coagulation dysfunction, potentially progressing to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to higher mortality. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), an early stage of DIC, benefits from early detection and intervention. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) predicts mortality in inflammatory diseases, but its link to SIC mortality is unclear. This study explored NLR's relevance to clinical outcomes in SIC patients. METHODS: SIC patients from the MIMIC-IV database were divided into four groups by NLR quartiles. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, while secondary outcomes included 90-day and 1-year mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality. The association between NLR and clinical outcomes in SIC patients was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. RESULTS: Among 5323 SIC patients (60.49% male), the median NLR was 7.64 (IQR: 4.30-14.82). The 28-day mortality rate was 16.96% (903), with a higher NLR in non-survivors (12.01 vs. 7.02, P < 0.001), and with a difference of 4.99 (95% CI 3.38-4.62; Z = 13.5). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher NLR was linked to increased short- and long-term mortality. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that elevated NLR was significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.16-1.59; P < 0.001). RCS analysis indicated a J-shaped relationship between NLR and mortality, with the lowest risk at the second quartile (Q2). ROC analysis showed that NLR had modest predictive value for mortality risk, with an AUC of 0.642 (95% CI 0.622-0.663) for 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: NLR is significantly associated with mortality in SIC patients and can predict short-and long-term mortality. This finding suggests that the NLR may be useful in identifying patients with SIC at high risk of mortality. Elevated NLR is significantly associated with increased mortality in SIC patients and can predict short-and long-term mortality. The relationship between NLR and mortality risk is J-shaped, with the lowest risk observed in the second quartile. While NLR demonstrates modest predictive value, its accessibility and ease of use make it a potentially valuable tool for early risk stratification and informing clinical decision-making in SIC patients, especially in emergencies or resource-limited settings."
41286668,Platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio as a novel prognostic biomarker in sepsis-associated AKI: a multicenter cohort study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury (SA-AKI) is a major complication in critically ill patients, yet early predictive biomarkers remain limited. Given the interplay between coagulation, inflammation, and microcirculatory dysfunction in SA-AKI pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio (PHR) and SA-AKI development in multicenter intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. METHODS: We extracted patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) databases. Based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, patients were stratified into AKI (n = 4,825) and non-AKI (n = 3,390) cohorts. Multiple statistical approaches-including multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability weighting (IPW)-were employed to adjust for confounders. The primary outcome was SA-AKI incidence. RESULTS: Elevated PHR was consistently associated with increased SA-AKI risk. In the adjusted logistic regression model, PHR remained independently predictive (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05-1.07; P < 0.001). This association was validated through PSM (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.11-1.13; P < 0.001) and IPW (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03; P < 0.001). The incidence of AKI significantly increases when PHR > 20. Generalized additive model (GAM) analysis revealed a linear correlation between PHR > 22 and SA-AKI mortality (P < 0.001), though PHR showed no significant association with AKI severity (P = 0.029). Our study demonstrates that the emerging biomarker PHR alone achieved an AUC of 0.845 for prognostic prediction and 0.584 for diagnostic performance. When combined with SOFA and SAPS-II, the prognostic model (Model 4) significantly improved (AUC = 0.906 and 0.713), outperforming individual components. CONCLUSIONS: PHR demonstrates a statistically significant association with SA-AKI risk in our analyses, its modest discriminative capacity highlights its role as a complementary rather than standalone predictor. These findings support further validation of PHR as a pragmatic biomarker to identify high-risk sepsis patients who may benefit from intensified hemodynamic or coagulation monitoring.

41286089,Development and validation of a machine learning model for predicting mortality risk in veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients.,2025,"This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based mortality risk prediction model for V-A ECMO patients to improve the precision of clinical decision-making. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 280 patients receiving V-A ECMO from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Yulin First People's Hospital, and the MIMIC-IV database. The data from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and the MIMIC-IV database were merged and randomly divided in a 7:3 ratio into a training set and an internal validation set, respectively. The dataset from Yulin First People's Hospital was reserved as an external validation cohort. The primary study outcome was defined as in-hospital mortality.Feature selection was conducted using Lasso regression, followed by the development of six machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LightGBM, and CatBoost. Model performance was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Model validation was performed through calibration and decision curve analysis. Feature importance was evaluated using SHAP, and subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the model's applicability across different clinical scenarios. In internal validation, the Logistic Regression model performed the best, with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.93), accuracy of 0.76, sensitivity of 0.73, specificity of 0.79, and an F1 score of 0.73. It outperformed other models (RF: AUC = 0.79, DNN: AUC = 0.78, SVM: AUC = 0.76, LightGBM: AUC = 0.71, CatBoost: AUC = 0.77). External validation yielded consistent results, with the Logistic Regression model's AUC at 0.75 (95% CI: 0.56-0.92), accuracy of 0.69, sensitivity of 0.64, specificity of 0.73, and an F1 score of 0.66. Calibration curve analysis revealed that the Logistic Regression model had the lowest Brier score (0.1496), indicating the most reliable predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model provided the highest net benefit across most decision thresholds. SHAP analysis identified lactate, age, and albumin as key predictors of mortality, with lactate and age positively correlated, and albumin negatively correlated. Subgroup analysis revealed better performance in the cardiac arrest group (AUC = 0.81), non-sepsis group (AUC = 0.75), and non-diabetes group (AUC = 0.78). The Logistic Regression-based mortality risk prediction model for V-A ECMO patients demonstrated comparable or even favorable performance to more complex machine learning models, with the advantage of higher interpretability.By explicitly incorporating lactate, age, and albumin as the principal predictors, this model facilitates precise risk stratification and provides practical support for clinical decision-making in ECMO management."
41285675,Sepsis management in the antimicrobial resistance era.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide. Its lethality, along with the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, is worsened by rising antibiotic resistance. Managing sepsis and septic shock is challenging, as underlying conditions can limit the reliability of many biomarkers used for early diagnosis. AREAS COVERED: This review comprehensively overviews the epidemiologic characteristics of sepsis, with particular emphasis on the key biomarkers used to support early diagnosis. Additionally, it explores emerging techniques for rapid microbiological identification of sepsis caused by multidrug- resistant organisms and evaluates the effectiveness of newly introduced antibiotics. EXPERT OPINION: In severe cases progressing to septic shock, timely and accurate diagnosis is critical. It is mandatory to make every effort to shorten the time to diagnosis in order to enable appropriate supportive care and targeted antibiotic therapy. In this context, novel microbiological diagnostic methods should be considered to facilitate early detection of multidrug-resistant organisms and promote the initiation of effective empiric antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the development of new molecules with innovative mechanisms of action, alongside therapeutic strategies targeting specific patterns of the immune response, is expected to improve the patient survival rates."
41285673,Enhanced CRISPR-Cas12a Fluorescent Assay for Detecting Trace Levels of Procalcitonin.,2025,"Rapid and accurate detection of procalcitonin (PCT), a major biomarker for bacterial infections and sepsis, remains a pressing need in clinical diagnostics because sepsis progresses rapidly and may initially present with nonspecific or even subtle symptoms. Herein, we report a CRISPR-Cas12a-based fluorescence biosensing platform for ultrasensitive detection of PCT. The platform employs antibody-functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) for specific protein enrichment and antibody- and oligonucleotide- dual-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for high-density DNA payload. After sandwich complex formation with the target PCT, a programmed ssDNA strand is released by thermal denaturation, which then activates Cas12a collateral cleavage, thereby generating a fluorescence signal. Thorough physicochemical characterizations, including zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, UV-vis spectroscopy, and TEM, were carried out to confirm the successful functionalization of MBs and AuNPs. The developed PCT sensor was highly sensitive with a limit of detection (LOD) reaching 3 pg/mL. Moreover, the biosensor exhibited an excellent specificity toward PCT against clinically relevant interferents such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2beta (IL-2beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), human serum albumin (HSA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and simulated serum sample analysis was successfully carried out with the recoveries ranging from 108 to 122%. The PCT sensing technique developed in this work offers the potential to be expanded to construct a multiplexing platform for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarker species for early and accurate disease diagnosis."
41284646,Prediction of graft loss in living donor liver transplantation during the early postoperative period.,2025,"Liver transplantation is almost the only way to save patients with end-stage liver disease. Particularly, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained importance in recent years thanks to the shorter waiting times and better graft quality than with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some patients experience graft loss due to unexpected infections, sepsis, or immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted organ. An urgent need exists to clarify which patients experience graft loss. Several models have been proposed, but most analyze the classic DDLT, and knowledge about LDLT is lacking. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 748 patients who underwent LDLT. By adapting machine learning methods, we predicted early graft loss (within 180 days postoperatively) with better performance than conventional models. The model enabled us to stratify a highly heterogeneous sample of patients into five groups. By focusing on survival time, we next categorized the patients into three groups with early, intermediate, and late or no graft loss. Notably, we identified the intermediate-loss group as a distinct population similar to the early-loss population but with different survival times. Additionally, by proposing a hierarchical prediction method, we developed an approach to distinguish these populations using data up to 30 days postoperatively. Our findings will enable the early identification of individuals at risk of graft loss, particularly those in the early- and intermediate-loss groups. This will allow for appropriate patient care, such as switching to DDLT, identifying other living donors for LDLT, or preparing for re-transplantation, leading to a bottom-up improvement in transplant success rates."
41281995,Attenuation of sepsis-induced myocardial injury by Xiangdan injection via mitochondrial protection and inflammation suppression in mice.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a leading cause of organ dysfunction and mortality in septic patients. Effective myocardial-protective therapies remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cardioprotective effects of Xiangdan injection in murine SIMI models caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to sham, sepsis, and three Xiangdan dose groups for each bacterial model using a randomization schedule. Xiangdan injection was administered by oral gavage 12 h before and immediately after bacterial challenge (prophylaxis/early intervention). Outcomes included survival, serum inflammatory cytokines, cardiac biomarkers, histopathology, and ultrastructural mitochondrial integrity. RESULTS: Xiangdan injection markedly improved survival, reduced inflammatory cytokines and cardiac biomarkers, ameliorated myocardial histopathology, and preserved mitochondrial integrity in a dose-dependent manner in both sepsis models (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Xiangdan injection conferred robust cardioprotection in sepsis, combining anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of cardiac injury markers, and preservation of mitochondrial structure. These outcomes are consistent with the known capacity of traditional Chinese medicine formulations to modulate TLR4/NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, thereby supporting mechanistic suppression of these cascades in our model."
41281283,"Predicting acute kidney injury in children with sepsis using red blood cell distribution and biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C).",2025,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a risk score model for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) in children with sepsis, using red blood cell distribution width (RDW), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and additional biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C) based on logistic regression (LR) analysis. METHODS: Children treated in the ICU of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from July 2021 to August 2022 were enrolled. The experimental group (Exp) included 155 children with sepsis, while the control group (Ctrl) consisted of 70 children. LR analysis was employed to identify factors associated with AKI risk. The Exp was further divided into two subgroups: the routine group (RG, n=77) and the intervention group (IG, n=78). The IG received intervention based on the risk score model, while the RG received routine treatment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: The two groups observed significant differences in white blood cell count (WBC) and RDW levels. The development of AKI in sepsis patients was strongly associated with RDW, APACHE II score, and the biomarkers PCT, IL-6, CRP, and cystatin C. After the intervention, the incidence of AKI and AKI grade 3 significantly decreased, along with lower rates of renal replacement therapy and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The LR-based model integrating RDW, APACHE II score, and biomarkers (PCT, IL-6, CRP, cystatin C) effectively predicts the risk of AKI in children with sepsis, offering a valuable tool for early intervention and improved patient outcomes."
41281040,"Comparison of Procalcitonin, C-reactive Protein, and Interleukin-6 in the Postoperative Course After Lung Decortication Surgery: A Prospective Observational Study.",2025,"Introduction Lung decortication is a surgical intervention performed to remove the fibrous pleural layer in conditions like pleural empyema or chronic pleuritis. Despite its therapeutic benefits, the postoperative period poses a high risk for complications such as infections and sepsis, which can significantly affect recovery. Biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) are increasingly employed to aid early detection of such complications. Objectives To evaluate and compare the roles of IL-6, CRP, and PCT in detecting postoperative sepsis in patients undergoing lung decortication and to determine their clinical utility in guiding early management decisions. Methods This observational study was conducted in the Departments of Anaesthesiology and General Surgery, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. A total of 112 patients aged 18-65 years with clinically proven pleural empyema undergoing elective lung decortication were enrolled. Patients on preoperative anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5, biomarkers were analyzed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US), applying t-tests, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significance threshold of p<0.05. Results Of 112 patients, 44 (39.3%) developed sepsis. Septic patients were older (mean age 40.84+/-14.08 years) than non-septic patients (mean age 28.09+/-8.00 years). PCT levels were significantly higher in septic patients across all time points (p<0.001), declining over time postoperatively. CRP levels were significantly elevated in septic patients on days 3 and 5. IL-6 and CRP showed limited but supportive diagnostic value. Mortality was higher in the septic group (6.8%), though not statistically significant. Conclusion Procalcitonin is the most reliable biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of postoperative sepsis following lung decortication. Combining PCT with CRP and IL-6 enhances diagnostic accuracy and informs timely therapeutic interventions."
41275751,AI-driven rapid identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens in blood smears of septic patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacterial and 3 fungal species from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of blood samples from sepsis patients. METHOD: ology: A total of 16 637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. Novelty of our technological workflow lies in combination of the Cellpose 3 model for robust and precise segmentation of microbial cells, followed by Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for sophisticated and context-aware classification. This comprehensive approach allows effective analysis of complex image data, overcoming limitations of standard single-instance classification in heterogeneous samples. RESULTS: Our model achieved high classification accuracy: 77.15 % for bacteria and 71.39 % for fungi, with ROC AUC values of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. Most accurate results, reaching up to 96.2 %, were obtained for: Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Nakaseomyces glabratus. We observed some classification difficulties in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and within Candida albicans. KEY CONTRIBUTIONS: Despite these challenges, the study confirms the model's significant potential. Our approach achieves microscopy image-based diagnosis while reducing the microbial diagnostic time. By identifying specific bacteria or fungal infection species, this technique improves sepsis diagnosis and its subsequent treatment. This is a simple and accessible alternative to current laborious methods and achieves high performance in species-specific classification. These results indicate the benefits of using artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical diagnosis of sepsis."
41275063,Antibiotic use in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy undergoing therapeutic hypothermia: time to rethink universal empirical treatment.,2025,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) can alter the immune system and may present symptoms similar to sepsis. This has led to widespread use of empirical antibiotics, despite limited evidence that support the need for universal empirical treatment. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of culture-proven sepsis and current antibiotic use patterns in neonates undergoing TH. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including term and near-term neonates with HIE treated with TH in two European NICUs with different antibiotic strategies: one with universal empirical antibiotics (Italy, n = 228) and one with selective use (Belgium, n = 74). We collected data on blood culture results, antibiotic exposure, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, PCT, leukocytes), and clinical outcomes. Of 302 newborns (276 term and 26 late preterm) who underwent TH, 278 (92%) received antibiotics at birth, with varying regimens for a median of 6 days. Blood cultures were performed in 228 Italian babies and in 72/74 Belgian infants (300 in total, equal to 99.3%), revealing only 2 cases of culture-confirmed early-onset sepsis (0.6%). In Belgium, all cultures from eight infants with clinical suspicion of sepsis were negative, resulting in a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 111 to prevent one confirmed infection. Late-onset sepsis occurred in four of 302 patients (1.3%). Biomarkers (CRP, PCT, leukocytes) fluctuated during cooling and rewarming but were not predictive of EOS. CONCLUSION: The incidence of confirmed early-onset sepsis in neonates with HIE undergoing TH was very low, despite extensive empirical antibiotic use. These findings question the necessity for routine universal empiric antibiotics and advocate for a selective risk-based approach based on clinical assessment. Careful monitoring and prudent antibiotic use are crucial to reduce unnecessary exposure and its potential harms in this vulnerable population. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Distinguishing the symptoms of HIE from those of EOS at birth or shortly thereafter is very complex, as they are often similar and can mimic one another. * Most newborns receiving hypothermic treatment are treated with empirical antibiotics in the suspicion of sepsis, even though the incidence of early-onset sepsis in the European healthcare context is very low. WHAT IS NEW: * Our multicentric study found a remarkably low incidence of confirmed EOS in newborns undergoing TH, irrespective of the antibiotic strategy used in each single center. * We provide data that can support a restriction on the use of empirical antibiotic therapy in neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, also considering the bacterial resistance that the imprudent use of antibiotics is turning into a global emergency."
41273874,Artificial intelligence for mortality risk stratification in septic shock: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is associated with high mortality, making accurate risk stratification crucial for tailored treatment. Traditional clinical scoring systems are limited by static assessments and suboptimal accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential for dynamic and personalized prediction; however, its clinical utility requires rigorous evaluation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis specifically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of AI for mortality risk stratification in septic shock and compares their performance against traditional clinical scoring systems. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was performed across Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, covering studies up to September 17, 2025. Studies developing or validating AI for mortality risk stratification in adult septic shock patients were included. Quality was assessed using the PROBAST + AI. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 56,502 patients were included. AI achieved a pooled sensitivity of 0.65, specificity of 0.81, and an AUC of 0.80 (Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.77-0.84). Notably, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and support vector machines (SVM) achieved the highest AUC of 0.91. Compared to traditional clinical scoring systems, AI demonstrated significantly higher specificity (0.81 vs. 0.66, P < 0.05) and AUC (0.80 vs. 0.69, P < 0.05). The most frequently utilized algorithm was logistic regression. No significant performance difference was observed between internal and external validation sets (AUC 0.80 vs. 0.78, P > 0.05). Substantial heterogeneity existed among the included studies, potentially arising from variations in AI algorithms, number of centers, septic shock definitions, data sources, mortality endpoints, clinical departments, and data splitting methods. CONCLUSIONS: AI demonstrates promising discrimination and higher specificity than traditional clinical scoring systems. However, the evidence remains limited by substantial heterogeneity and potential bias,and its clinical utility requires further validation through prospective, multicenter studies."
41273847,STING-FSP1 signaling drives endothelial ferroptosis and vascular leakage in sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis-induced vascular endothelial injury, characterized by ferroptosis and barrier dysfunction, remains a major cause of mortality. This study investigates the role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) pathway in mediating endothelial ferroptosis during sepsis and explores therapeutic interventions. A murine sepsis model was established using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), along with LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). STING activation was modulated using inhibitor H-151 and siRNA silencing. Ferroptosis was assessed through lipid peroxidation (MDA, BODIPY C11), Fe(2+) accumulation (FerroOrange), and FSP1/GPX4 expression. Vascular permeability was quantified via Evans Blue extravasation and FITC-Dextran assays. STING activation in septic endothelial cells suppressed FSP1 expression, amplifying lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. CLP mice exhibited elevated vascular leakage, which H-151 reversed. STING inhibition restored FSP1 levels, reduced Fe(2+) overload, and preserved VE-cadherin integrity. FSP1 inhibition abolished these protective effects, confirming its necessity in STING-mediated ferroptosis. The STING/FSP1 axis exacerbates septic endothelial injury by driving ferroptosis. Targeting this pathway reduces oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction, highlighting its therapeutic potential for sepsis."
41273150,sTREM-1 as a biomarker for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis following abdominal surgery.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis represents a critical response to infection; it is characterized by systemic inflammation, shock, and potential organ failure. Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (sTREM-1) has been identified as a crucial marker in sepsis, connecting the activation of innate immunity to systemic inflammation. METHODS: This prospective nested case control study was carried out in the intensive care unit and surgery department from March 2018 to June 2019. Adults undergoing abdominal surgery, with and without sepsis, were included in the study, and sTREM-1 and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included in the study, comprising 31 noninfected individuals, 37 with sepsis, and 52 with septic shock. sTREM-1 levels were statistically significantly elevated in patients with sepsis and septic shock compared with noninfected individuals (P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.722 for sTREM-1 in the prediction of septic shock. DISCUSSION: Elevated sTREM-1 levels are associated with the severity of sepsis and may function as a prognostic biomarker. Additional research is required to confirm these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions aimed at the sTREM-1 pathway."
41272676,"Immune cell dynamics, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): a multiparametric analysis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a complex and multifactorial life-threatening reaction triggered by trauma or infection (sepsis). Since the dynamics of immune cells, cytokines and novel markers such as circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) remain incompletely elucidated, we aimed to provide a comprehensive multiparametric characterization of this severe response, to identify potential prognostic and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We conducted a multiparametric and sequential quantification of up to 25 immune cell circulating populations using next-generation flow cytometry, assessed plasma cytokine levels with Luminex technology, and the characterized and quantified EVs and their microRNA content. Peripheral blood samples were taken at 0, 24 and 72 h after SIRS onset from 25 patients with polytrauma-induced SIRS (PT group) and 25 developed SIRS from other origins, such as pulmonary or urinary infections (NP-denoting non-polytrauma group). Samples from 21 healthy donors (HD) were analysed as a control group. Statistical analyses were performed to compare experimental groups (PT, NP, HD) and to evaluate correlations between experimental findings and patients' outcomes for potential prognostic markers discovery. RESULTS: SIRS patients exhibited increased leukocyte counts driven by neutrophil mobilization combined with a reduction of dendritic cells and lymphocytes early after the SIRS. The PT group showed an increase in classical monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and mesenchymal stromal cells compared to HD. These dynamics occurred alongside substantial chemokine release, including IL-8, G-CSF, CCL2 in both SIRS groups, MIF in PT and CCL4 in NP. Both SIRS groups experienced a pronounced cytokine storm with simultaneous release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased of plasma EV levels. Our findings suggest that elevated IL-8 concentrations and increased counts of circulating monocytes and MDSCs are associated with worse prognosis and may serve as valuable prognostic indicators in SIRS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the dynamic kinetics of multiple cell subsets, cytokines and EVs during SIRS, highlighting differences between SIRS initiated by polytrauma versus non-polytrauma events and identifying correlations between biological findings and patient outcomes."
41272557,Prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers and Phoenix criteria in pediatric sepsis: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of cardiac biomarkers at admission on the prognosis and timing of vasoactive drug administration in children with sepsis according to the 2005 SIRS criteria. Additionally, the Phoenix sepsis criteria have been applied to patients and examined in detail. METHODS: The study was conducted as a single-center retrospective study between March 2019 and 2022. Laboratory parameters and echocardiographic measurements at admission were evaluated. The primary outcomes are mortality and vasoactive drug use. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the time to initiate vasoactive drugs. RESULTS: In this study 162 (45.1% females) children with sepsis were included. The total mortality was 26.4%. Among the 162 patients, 28.6% were not classified as having sepsis according to the Phoenix 4 criteria and 24.2% according to the Phoenix 8 criteria. Among the non-surviving patients, 9.3% were not classified as sepsis according to the Phoenix 4 criteria (p = 0.001) and 7% according to the Phoenix 8 criteria (p = 0.002). ROC analysis revealed that a pro-BNP value of >/= 1835 ng/L predicted the initiation of vasoactive therapy with 73.1% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory parameters such as pro-BNP obtained in the early stages of the disease could serve as good guides for in determining the timing of initiation of vasoactive drug therapy. Furthermore, the fact that children who died did not meet the Phoenix sepsis criteria raises concerns about the ability of these criteria to detect sepsis at an early stage."
41270997,Endothelial protein C receptor CD201 is a better marker than stem cell antigen-1 to identify mouse long-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells following septic challenge.,2026,"Stem cell antigen-1 (SCA1) is widely used to identify mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) among lineage-negative KIT(+) (LK) cells. However, SCA1 is expressed only in a few inbred mouse strains and becomes strongly upregulated in LK cells following in vivo challenge with interferons, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or pathogens, leading to incorrect analysis of HSC functional subsets and delineation of HSC, MPP, and lineage-restricted progenitor phenotypes. Endothelial protein C receptor CD201 can be used as an alternative marker for mouse and even human HSC. However, whether CD201 expression changes following infectious challenge is unknown. Unlike SCA1, CD201 expression did not change on mouse LK cells in response to LPS in vivo. Long-term competitive transplantations with CD201(+), CD201(-), or SCA1(+) LK cells showed that most reconstituting HSCs are within the LK CD201(+) population after LPS challenge. However, the long-term competitive repopulation potential of LK SCA1(+) cells from LPS-treated mice was much more severely reduced than that of LK CD201(+) cells from the same LPS-treated donors, suggesting that the LK SCA1(+) population in challenged donors becomes contaminated with CD201(-) progenitors devoid of long-term repopulation potential. Based on the CD201 gating strategy, we reassessed the effect of LPS on HSC and MPP cycling and mobilization and their dependency on MY88 and TRIF adaptors. In conclusion, CD201 enables a more accurate analysis of mouse HSC and MPP subsets in all inbred strains in septic conditions or steady state."
41270642,Inhibition of AKR1C3 attenuates sepsis-induced acute liver injury by blocking the TRAF6/NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,2026,"Acute liver injury (ALI), a life-threatening complication of sepsis in critically ill patients, remains a significant clinical challenge with limited therapeutic options. While Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3 (AKR1C3), a key regulator of inflammatory and immune responses, has emerged as a critical regulator in sepsis progression, its functional role and molecular mechanisms in sepsis-induced ALI remain poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of AKR1C3 inhibition and elucidate its underlying mechanisms in ALI pathogenesis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis murine model, we observed significant upregulation of AKR1C3 protein expression in liver tissues, correlating with disease severity. Pharmacological inhibition of AKR1C3 dramatically ameliorated CLP-induced hepatic pathological damage, restored liver function biomarkers, and attenuated systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, AKR1C3 suppression inhibited hepatocyte pyroptosis by blocking NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release via inactivation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Further molecular studies revealed that AKR1C3 potentiates NF-kappaB activity by interacting with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and enhancing its ubiquitination, thereby facilitating downstream inflammatory cascades. Collectively, our findings identify the AKR1C3/TRAF6/NF-kappaB axis as a novel regulatory pathway driving sepsis-associated ALI and propose AKR1C3 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for this critical condition."
41268561,Decoding immune low-response states in sepsis: single-cell and 3D spatial transcriptomic insights into immunoparalysis.,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of critical illness worldwide. Despite advances in supportive care, durable benefit from immune-directed therapies is limited, reflecting heterogeneity with immune low-response states ('immunoparalysis') across innate and adaptive compartments. In this review we summarize advances from single-cell RNA and ATAC profiling, immune-repertoire assays and 3D spatial transcriptomics that resolve monocyte, dendritic-cell (cDC1, cDC2 and pDC), lymphocyte and NK-cell programs, and appraise translational opportunities spanning endotype-guided risk stratification, pharmacodynamic monitoring and spatial biomarkers. We also discuss enduring challenges-including assay standardization, harmonized thresholds for monocyte HLA-DR and whole-blood stimulation, and limited availability of clinically compatible spatial platforms-that temper implementation. By integrating bedside function (HLA-DR trajectories, LPS-induced cytokine capacity) with single-cell endotypes (MS1/HLA-DR;low S100A;high monocytes, dendritic-cell attrition, checkpoint-biased T cells) and host-pathogen topology from FFPE-ready spatial assays, emerging strategies aim to restore antigen presentation, reconstitute priming, disrupt inhibitory myeloid-lymphoid circuits and prevent secondary infection. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of immunoparalysis-informed precision medicine in sepsis and outlines pragmatic standards for composite biomarkers, patient selection and on-therapy decision rules. We hope these insights will assist investigators and clinicians as they endeavor to convert descriptive immune low-response states into tractable, reversible clinical entities."
41268065,Multi-Dimensional Characterization of Programmed Cell Death Patterns for Prognostic Stratification and Therapeutic Insights in Sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome characterized by dysregulated immune responses and multiple forms of programmed cell death (PCD). Comprehensive understanding of the PCD landscape may provide insights into prognosis and therapeutic targets, whereas its role in sepsis is not well-explored. METHODS: Using the microarray dataset for sepsis (GSE65682), we systematically profiled 14 PCD patterns in sepsis and stratified patients into molecular subtypes with distinct immune landscapes and clinical outcomes. PCD-related prognostic signature was developed and validated across multiple cohorts. Single-cell and multi-organ transcriptomic analyses were conducted to elucidate cellular heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Molecular docking was used to explore interactions between active compounds of Simiao Yongan Decoction (SMYAD) and key PCD-related proteins. RESULTS: Two clusters with differential transcriptional programs and immune infiltration patterns were identified, in which Cluster 1 showed poorer prognosis. We then developed a seven-gene signature (ELANE, CTSG, MPO, CAMP, TFRC, IL1B, CASP5) that effectively stratified patients by survival outcomes, with robust predictive performance across independent datasets. Neutrophils, monocytes, plasma, and dendritic cells were major mediators of PCD-associated immune dysregulation, in which neutrophils showing the strongest response. Temporal transcriptomics revealed peak expression of prognostic genes in bone marrow and peripheral blood within three days post-onset, suggesting an early therapeutic window. Finally, molecular docking indicated that SMYAD compounds may target PCD proteins (MPO, ELANE, IL1B) and modulate immune responses. CONCLUSION: This study delineates the multi-dimensional role of PCD in sepsis, establishes a reliable prognostic model with strong predictive value, and highlights SMYAD as a potential multi-target therapy. These findings provide new avenues for risk stratification and suggest the promise of integrating PCD biology with adjunctive immunomodulatory strategies."
41267877,Early prediction of sepsis-induced coagulopathy in the ICU using interpretable machine learning: a multi-center retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a fatal complication in ICU patients, yet early risk prediction remains challenging. This study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning model for predicting SIC within seven days of ICU admission. METHODS: Clinical data for model development were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Feature selection was performed using three distinct algorithms: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE), and the Boruta method. Ten machine learning models underwent training employing 5-fold cross-validation on the training subset, with subsequent evaluation on the validation subset encompassing discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility metrics. The optimal model underwent further interpretability analysis through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate variable contributions and their directional effects. External validation was then conducted using the electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Finally, the best-performing model was implemented as a web-based Shiny application featuring an interactive interface. RESULTS: Among 10,740 patients in MIMIC-IV, 2,232 (20.78%) developed SIC within 7 days post-ICU admission. A LightGBM model with thirteen variables demonstrated optimal performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.885 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.874-0.897) in the internal validation set and 0.831 (95% CI: 0.819-0.843) in the external eICU-CRD cohort. Key predictive variables included Prothrombin Time-International Normalization Ratio (INR), platelet count, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), lactate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), red cell distribution width (RDW), bicarbonate, phosphate, hemoglobin, age, the presence of heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD) and the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The model was deployed as a clinician-oriented web application providing an accessible interface (https://shatao.shinyapps.io/Sepsis_Induced_Coagulopathy/). CONCLUSION: This model demonstrated strong predictive ability and clinical interpretability, enabling early SIC identification and targeted intervention."
41266700,Knowledge gaps in extracorporeal blood purification: what would be required for its successful application in septic shock?,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that results in organ dysfunction. Extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) therapies traditionally aim to remove circulating mediators involved in this pathological response, although novel technologies that can remove cells and even living pathogens have recently been developed. Despite their growing clinical use, robust evidence supporting EBP in septic shock as an adjuvant therapy is lacking, and several knowledge gaps hinder their effective and safe application. This narrative review critically examines these gaps from both mechanistic and clinical perspectives. Key issues include the dynamic and compartmentalized nature of the immune response, the unclear roles of specific cytokines, and the potential removal of protective anti-inflammatory mediators. Broad-spectrum adsorption may induce unintended immunomodulatory effects, including desorption and altered leukocyte trafficking. Selective approaches, such as endotoxin removal with polymyxin B hemoadsorption, face challenges related to dose, patient stratification, and the limitations of endotoxin activity assays. Therapeutic plasma exchange offers the potential to restore homeostasis but raises questions regarding optimal regimens, replacement fluids, and the risk of unintended drug clearance. The heterogeneity of trial designs, insufficient patient phenotyping, and variability in treatment protocols have led to inconclusive or conflicting clinical outcomes, including some trials suggesting potential harm. This review underscores the need for better mechanistic understanding, real-time immune monitoring, and ideally targeted clinical trial designs to define which patients might benefit from EBP and when. Ultimately, the path to effective application of EBP in sepsis lies in individualized therapy guided by immune profiling, biomarker-driven stratification, and rigorous evaluation in high-quality randomized controlled trials."
41262247,"Roles of cytokine storm in sepsis progression: biomarkers, and emerging therapeutic strategies.",2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome marked by uncontrolled systemic inflammation, cytokine storm, and organ dysfunction. Central to its pathogenesis is innate immune hyperactivation, which triggers excessive cytokine release and inflammatory cell death, ultimately driving multiorgan failure. Despite advancements in intensive care, immune dysregulation remains a major therapeutic hurdle. Moreover, recent discoveries of emerging biomarkers, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), monocyte distribution width (MDW), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and RDW-to-albumin ratio (RAR), highlight their potential diagnostic and prognostic value. This review systematically summarizes the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, emphasizing the roles of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we outline current and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting both immune overactivation and late-stage immunosuppression, including cytokine antagonists, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and nanomedicine-based approaches, providing a comprehensive framework to guide precision immunotherapy in sepsis management."
41262245,AIMing for survival: The impact of the free and total AIM concentration in septic patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, remains a major cause of mortality worldwide. Identifying reliable biomarkers for prognosis and treatment is urgently needed. This study investigates the role of the Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophages (AIM), also known as CD5L, as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in sepsis. METHODS: We measured free and total AIM concentrations in 90 septic patients enrolled in SepsisDataNet.NRW cohort (German Clinical Trial Registry No. DRKS00018871; http://www.sepsisdatanet.nrw). Blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 8, and AIM levels were quantified using ELISA. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression were performed to assess the association between AIM levels and 30-day survival. Western blot analysis was performed to detect AIM in human serum IgM and in the IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG preparation Pentaglobin((R)). RESULTS: High total AIM concentrations (>85 ng/ml) were significantly associated with improved 30-day survival on day 1 (HR: 3.131, 95% CI: 1.629-6.019, p = 0.009), 4 (HR: 2.525, 95% CI: 1.198-5.322, p = 0.0042), and day 8 (HR: 2.317, 95% CI: 0.8565-6.266, p = 0.0457). Free AIM showed a significant association with survival only on day 8 (HR: 2.374, 95% CI: 0.8721-6.461, p = 0.0393). CONCLUSION: Total AIM concentration is a significant predictor of a 30-day survival in sepsis, supporting its potential use as a prognostic biomarker. Our findings also suggest that AIM may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential target for immune-modulating therapies, including IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)."
41261431,Inhalable targeted CD8 + T cell nanoparticles loaded ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 alleviate acute lung injury.,2025,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common clinical complication of sepsis and ferroptosis plays an important role in ALI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CD8 antibodies modified PD-1 engineered CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTL) membrane loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)/ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) (CD8@PD-1-CTL-M@PLGA/Fer-1) on acute lung injury (ALI). High expression PD-1 CD8 + T (CTL) was established and the membrane (PD-1-CTL-M) was extracted, CD8 monoclonal antibody modified PD-1-CTL-M was used to enhance the targeting capability of PLGA/Fer-1 nanoparticles to target CD8 + T (CTL). ALI model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with mice and CD8 + T (CTL). The results showed that CD8@PD-1-CTL-M significantly enhanced the protective effects of PLGA/Fer-1 on ALI and targetability of PLGA/Fer-1 nanoparticles on CD8 + T (CTL). The mechanism was related to CD8@PD-1-CTL-M@PLGA/Fer-1 targeting regulation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signal pathway in CD8 + T (CTL). This study provided a new treatment method for ALI."
41260501,Serum AGP-1-Le(x) Glycoforms Report on Survivorship of Patients with Septic Shock Upon Admission to Intensive Care Unit.,2026,"Septic shock, the excessive immune response to pathogen infection, accounts globally for  approximately 20% of all deaths. Current methods to establish disease severity are unacceptably slow, unspecific, and insensitive, hindering timely and effective treatment. Aiming to establish easy-to-measure glyco-signatures that may identify the most critically unwell patients, we applied comparative glycomics and glycoproteomics to sera longitudinally collected from septic shock survivors (n = 29) and nonsurvivors (n = 8). Glycomics of all 134 serum samples (sampled daily until recovery/death) revealed significant N-glycome dynamics across both patient groups. Unsupervised clustering of the serum N-glycome measured upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission (day 1) indicated survivorship-specific glyco-signatures. We therefore employed machine learning to train a random forest model using the serum N-glycome data. The model accurately classified survivorship outcomes of 35 of 37 patients (accuracy 94.6%) and correctly predicted 29 of 29 survivors (specificity 100%) and six of eight nonsurvivors (sensitivity 75%). Interrogation of the serum N-glycome data revealed that Lewis x (Le(x))-type N-glycans are elevated in nonsurvivors relative to survivors at ICU admission, a finding recapitulated by glycoproteomics. Among the 58 other Le(x)-containing serum glycoproteins that were strongly associated with acute phase response and stress pathways, alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP-1) was identified as a principal carrier of Le(x) glycoepitopes with a potential to stratify septic shock survivors from nonsurvivors (AUC 0.90). This study lays a foundation for risk stratification of septic shock patients by uncovering easy-to-assay AGP-1-Le(x) glycoforms that identify individuals experiencing poor survival outcomes already upon ICU admission, with the potential to translate to early individualized clinical care at the bedside."
41259840,The diagnostic and prognostic value of circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio in Urosepsis: A prospective study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Urosepsis is a severe complication of urinary tract infections with high morbidity and mortality. Reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical value of the circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio (miR-Ratio) in the early diagnosis and 28-day prognostic prediction of urosepsis. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling patients with urosepsis (n = 62), complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI, n = 124), and healthy controls (n = 60) between January 2023 and December 2024. Serum samples were collected prior to treatment. Exosomes were isolated, and the expression levels of miR-21-5p and miR-181b-5p were quantified to calculate the miR-Ratio. Associations with inflammatory markers, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, acute kidney injury (AKI), and 28-day mortality were assessed using correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The miR-Ratio was significantly elevated in urosepsis compared with controls (P < 0.001) and positively correlated with SOFA score, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and 28-day mortality. ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 for diagnosing urosepsis, with 94.4 % sensitivity and 89.5 % specificity. Multivariate analysis identified the miR-Ratio as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (HR = 3.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The circulating exosomal miR-21-5p/miR-181b-5p ratio may serve as a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of urosepsis, improving risk stratification and supporting precision clinical management."
41259428,Infection of endothelial cells by Streptococcus agalactiae reveals potential role of PI-2b pilus on endothelial barrier dysfunction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae is responsible for sepsis and meningitis, and the major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, how S. agalactiae disrupts endothelial barriers is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Analyse the influence of endothelial cell (HUVECs) growth under static and shear stress conditions during infection with S. agalactiae, and the role of pilus PI-2b during endothelial barrier disruption and increased endothelial permeability. METHODS: HUVECs under static and shear conditions were infected by S. agalactiae (GBS90356 and GBS90356Deltapilus2b) strains in the presence and absence of fibrinogen. VE-cadherin was evaluated by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR assays, and the endothelial permeability by transwell assay. FINDS: Shear stress induced the alignment of HUVECs and increased the adherence of S. agalactiae strains (GBS90356 and GBS90356Deltapilus2b), mainly in the presence of fibrinogen, in addition to greater peripheral localisation of VE-cadherin. Rupture points and damage to endothelial integrity was visualised after infection with the GBS90356WT strain, mainly in the presence of fibrinogen. RT-PCR analyses identified increase in VE-cadherin expression in HUVECs under shear stress and a decrease in VE-cadherin after infection, with increased levels of endothelial permeability. MAIN CONCLUSION: Data demonstrate for the first time the dysfunction of the adhesive barrier induced by the S. agalactiae ST-17 strain, mainly in HUVECs under shear stress, where PI-2b expression was essential to optimise the damage to endothelial integrity."
41259376,Dissecting the role of NETosis-related biomarkers in Sepsis: An integrated multi-dataset analysis for diagnostic and prognostic applications.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality and economic burdens. The study analyzed non-redundant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to elucidate neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation's role in sepsis pathogenesis using high-throughput microarray and bioinformatics. Our comprehensive analysis meticulously identified a total of 629 DEGs, encompassing 348 upregulated and 281 downregulated genes. Through further scrutiny, we discovered 37 NETosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs) that showcased distinct expression patterns. Enrichment analysis vividly revealed the significant involvement of these NRDEGs in pathways related to NET formation, phagocytosis, and lymphocyte migration, thereby highlighting the crucial role of neutrophils in the immune response during sepsis. Additionally, CIBERSORT algorithm analysis indicated substantial differences in the abundance of 17 immune cell types between the sepsis and control groups, further reinforcing the altered immune landscape in sepsis patients. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed from the NRDEGs identified nine core genes, suggesting their potential central position in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that ITGAM, CXCR2, and FCGR3B exhibited extremely high accuracy in distinguishing sepsis from controls (with an area under the curve greater than 0.9). These remarkable findings strongly underscore the potential of these genes as biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets in sepsis, emphasizing the urgent need for further validation in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and refine treatment strategies. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis, paving the way for improved clinical interventions."
41258927,Construction of a Minimal Sensor Array Using Fingerprint Protein Corona on Nanostars for Detecting Protein Isoforms and Disease States.,2026,"Signature-based protein detection coupled with machine learning algorithms has revolutionized traditional sensing methods, providing rapid, inexpensive, and selectivity-driven detection without the use of specialized equipment. This strategy leverages selective interactions with a sensor array to create a global signature pattern using machine learning. The reference pattern provides an effective tool to stratify the analytes, identify blinded unknowns, and predict altered signatures of the analyte that could be missed by the common specificity-based sensors. Protein corona adsorbed on a nanoparticle surface presents fingerprint signatures of the bound proteins, which can potentially be harnessed to profile protein biomarkers. Herein, we demonstrate that gold nanostars (AuNS) generate a fingerprint protein corona that dictates the modulation of the AuNS surface plasmons upon etching. The resultant spectrometric signatures are utilized in discriminating between diverse proteins, including isoforms, at significantly low concentrations and with a wide dynamic range. The approach effectively discerns the protein corona signatures of healthy controls from two preclinical disease models of autoimmune dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and Salmonella Typhimurium infection-induced sepsis, demonstrating its clinical diagnostic potential. Notably, the ability of AuNS to offer binding recognition and signal transduction on a single platform introduces a robust material for signature-based detections, simplifying the sensor fabrication and offering a great opportunity for the identification of diverse targets."
41258046,Reduced plasma levels of Copine 5 correlate with sepsis-induced vascular leakage and mortality in human patients and a murine sepsis model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vascular leakage is a major cause of multiple organ failure and mortality in sepsis, and factors that regulate endothelial integrity could serve as promising biomarkers of septic shock development. Copine family members (CPNEs) are well-characterized as soluble membrane-binding proteins, whether CPNEs play a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity during sepsis, however, remains unclear. METHODS: Human aorta single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data were analyzed for the expression profile of all Copine family members (CPNE1-9). Plasma levels of CPNE5, Ang-II, sICAM-1, and SDC-1 were measured in human sepsis patients at admission and healthy donors as well as in septic mice induced by injection i.p. with cecal slurry. The correlation of CPNE5 levels to other three factors (Ang-II, sICAM-1, SDC-1) were analyzed. CPNE5-knockdown endothelial cells (ECs) and global CPNE5-knockout (KO) mice were utilized to determine the critical role of CPNE5 in sepsis-triggered vascular leakage, organ damage and mortality. RESULTS: Among nine CPNEs, only CPNE5 is predominantly expressed in human aorta endothelial cells. In sepsis patients (n = 77), plasma levels of CPNE5 were significantly reduced, whereas plasma levels of Ang-II, sICAM-1, and SDC-1 were markedly elevated, compared to healthy donors (n = 44; p < 0.01). Similar findings were also observed in a murine sepsis model induced by cecal slurry (CS)-injection intraperitoneally. Furthermore, in the supernatants of cultured ECs treated with LPS or pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture (Cytomix: TNFalpha/IL-1beta/IFNgamma, each 10 ng/mL), the concentrations of CPNE5 were significantly lower, which was negatively correlated with the higher EC permeability, compared to the control group. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CPNE5 in ECs caused hyperpermeability upon stimulation with LPS or Cytomix. In vivo, we observed that loss of CPNE5 increased vascular leakage, leading to severe organ injury and higher mortality, compared to WT mice upon septic conditions. The initial mechanistic analysis showed that the reduction of CPNE5 in cardiac and pulmonary ECs was linked to the increased cleavage of membrane tight junctions and adherens junctions. CONCLUSIONS: These observations from human sepsis patients and a murine sepsis model suggest that reduced plasma levels of CPNE5 may contribute to sepsis-induced vascular leakage and mortality."
41257583,"The predictive performance of NEWS, MEWS, SOFA and SAPS II in outcomes of bacteremic and non-bacteremic sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the prognostic accuracy of sepsis scores and inflammatory biomarkers in predicting mortality, bacteremia, and septic shock among sepsis patients, with comparisons across bacteremic and non-bacteremic groups. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center in western India. A total of 196 sepsis patients were enrolled and categorized into bacteremic (n = 95) and non-bacteremic (n = 101) groups. Key sepsis scores analyzed included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II). Outcomes measured included 30-day mortality, bacteraemia prediction, and septic shock. Diagnostic performance was assessed using area under curve (AUCs), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (OR) analysis. RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate was 27.0%. Among all patients, NEWS (AUC: 0.861, 95% CI: 0.81-0.92, p < 0.001) and SOFA (AUC: 0.738, 95% CI:0.65-0.82, p < 0.001) demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for 30 days mortality. Subgroup analysis revealed that, in bacteremic sepsis, NEWS (AUC: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-0.99, p < 0.001) and ferritin (AUC: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.71-0.90, p < 0.001) showed the highest predictive values, while SOFA (AUC: 0.852, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94, p < 0.001) and HsCRP (AUC: 0.623, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74, p = 0.033) were most predictive for mortality in non-bacteremic sepsis. MEWS (>/= 7) demonstrated the strongest association with bacteremia (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.4-11, p < 0.001, adjusted for age, and comorbidities), followed by SOFA (>/= 6), (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.2, p = 0.005). For septic shock prediction, SOFA (>/= 6) (OR: 5.7) and procalcitonin (>/= 2.5 ng/mL) (OR: 4.9) were the strongest predictors. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS and SOFA demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, with ferritin providing additional value in bacteremic patients. For bacteremia prediction, MEWS (>/= 7) showed the highest association. These tools can provide critical support for clinicians in risk stratification and early intervention in severe sepsis.

41256846,Combatting sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction: emerging mechanisms and immunomodulatory breakthroughs.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) critically contributes to mortality in systemic inflammatory responses, driven by multifaceted mechanisms including dysregulated inflammation, immunosuppression, oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction. Emerging pathways involve m6A RNA methylation (mediated by methyltransferase METTL3), which coordinates inflammation, apoptosis, and ferroptosis through transcriptomic rewiring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve dual roles: propagating injury via microRNA-885-5p/HMBOX1-induced pyroptosis and delivering therapeutic cargo (e.g., microRNA-223) to suppress inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction, marked by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and impaired sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) stability, exacerbates metabolic disorder. Autonomic neuromodulation strategies, such as electroacupuncture and noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation, attenuate cardiac injury by rebalancing neuroimmune interactions. Complement hyperactivation (C5a-C5a receptor axis) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibodies) show preclinical efficacy. However, challenges persist in addressing immune heterogeneity, dynamic biomarker profiling, and optimal therapeutic timing. This review bridges mechanistic discoveries to clinical innovation, proposing a paradigm shift toward precision therapies. Future research must bridge mechanistic insights with clinical innovation. By harmonizing pathophysiological understanding with precision medicine approaches, this synthesis underscores the potential to transform SIMD management from supportive care to targeted functional recovery."
41255658,"Neonatal and pediatric sepsis: Microbiological insights, diagnostic innovations, and antimicrobial challenges.",2025,"Neonatal and pediatric sepsis remains a major global health concern, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. The clinical and microbiological characteristics of sepsis differ markedly in neonates and children, necessitating tailored diagnostic and treatment approaches. This mini-review explores the evolving microbiological landscape, recent advancements in diagnostic methodologies, and challenges posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in managing neonatal and pediatric sepsis. Emerging pathogens, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and fungal organisms, are reshaping the epidemiology of sepsis. Innovations in molecular diagnostics, including polymerase chain reaction-based platforms, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence-integrated tools, are revolutionizing early pathogen detection and resistance profiling. However, implementation gaps persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Therapeutic challenges are compounded by limited pediatric data on newer antimicrobials and rising AMR rates. Infection prevention strategies, especially in intensive care units, are crucial to outbreak containment. An integrated approach combining microbiological surveillance, rapid diagnostics, and antimicrobial stewardship is critical for improving sepsis outcomes. Future research should focus on context-specific implementation of diagnostic tools and optimizing treatment strategies for resource-limited settings."
41255589,The Intestinal Immune Network for IgA Production is Involved in the Development and Progression of Sepsis: A Multi-Omics Study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Intestinal barrier injury plays a significant role in the development and progression of sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: The ""intestinal immune network for IgA production"" pathway (KEGG ID: hsa04672) is closely associated with the intestinal barrier. This study integrated bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data, a clinical trial, an animal study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to elucidate the role of hsa04672 during sepsis. RESULTS: Enrichment analyses confirmed the relationship between hsa04672 and sepsis. Four machine learning algorithms identified HLA-DPA1 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.995), ITGB7 (AUC = 0.967), and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.942) as hsa04672-associated diagnostic biomarkers. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) revealed suppressed activity of hsa04672 in sepsis patients. Two independent methods (GSVA scores and consensus clustering) generated hsa04672-associated sepsis subgroups. Kaplan-Meier analyses subsequently confirmed significant survival differences between these subgroups, indicating a relationship between hsa04672 and sepsis prognosis. Afterwards, univariable Cox, LASSO, and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified ANKRD55, CX3CR1, and GIMAP4 as hsa04672-associated prognostic biomarkers. Based on these prognostic biomarkers, we constructed a nomogram model, whose accuracy and robustness were demonstrated through calibration curves, decision curve analyses, and time-dependent ROC curves. In the animal study, reduced intestinal IgA production was observed in severe sepsis. Single-cell analyses revealed the activities of hsa04672 and the expression patterns of biomarkers within each immune cell type across healthy controls, sepsis survivors, and sepsis nonsurvivors. MR analyses suggested that elevated CXCR4 expression was a risk factor of sepsis (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.58, P = 0.036), and decreased GIMAP4 expression was a risk factor of 28-day death in sepsis (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: The ""intestinal immune network for IgA production"" is deeply involved in the development and progression of sepsis."

Despite its clinical severity, the immunometabolic mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify immunometabolism-associated genes in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and analyze immune infiltration.MethodsWe integrated single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from septic cohorts, using a multistep bioinformatic approach involving machine learning and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify key immunometabolism-associated genes and explore their role in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Key findings were validated using in vitro and in vivo experiments.ResultsWe identified two distinct macrophage subsets (functional and senescent) and prioritized four hub genes, including ABLIM1, BCL9L, SMAD3, and DHRS3, which formed a robust prognostic model (area under the curve = 0.724). In vivo and in vitro validation confirmed significant downregulation of these hub genes in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant increases in monocytes, M0/M1 macrophages, and neutrophils in sepsis, with hub genes showing significant correlations with specific immune cell subsets.ConclusionsThis study identifies ABLIM1, BCL9L, SMAD3, and DHRS3 genes as pivotal biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, linked to immune-metabolic dysregulation and myocardial injury. These findings provide new insights for early diagnosis and precision immunotherapy of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy."
41253992,Ability of the hypotension prediction index to predict hypotension in patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit.,2025,"The hypotension prediction index (HPI) is a machine learning-based model for predicting hypotension. It provides good performance for predicting intraoperative hypotension but has rarely been studied in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This prospective study aimed to determine the ability of HPI to predict hypotension in ICU-admitted patients with septic shock. Hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of < 65 mmHg >/= 1 min. Non-hypotensive events included MAP > 75 and >/= 65 mmHg for the primary and secondary objectives, respectively. Positive events were selected at 5, 10, and 15-min before hypotension. Thirty patients with septic shock (293,315 data points) were included; 645 hypotensive events occurred, with a median of 14.5 [8-31] events/patient and a median time of 3.2 [2.5-4] min. At 5 and 10 min before hypotension, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of HPI was significantly higher than at 15 min (0.953 vs. 0.919, p = 0.002 and 0.934 vs. 0.919, p = 0.01, respectively). HPI at 5, 10, and 15 min before the events showed better performance than other hemodynamic variables. However, after including MAP 65-75 mmHg as a non-hypotensive event, the ability of HPI declined and was similar to that of current MAP for predicting hypotension at all time points (AUC 0.817 vs. 0.786, p = 0.28 for 5 min, 0.787 vs. 0.761, p = 0.4 for 10 min, and 0.753 vs. 0.720, p = 0.31 for 15 min before the event). HPI showed excellent performance in predicting hypotension in septic shock patients in the ICU. However, its ability decreased when MAP 65-75 mmHg was considered non-hypotension. The HPI algorithm requires revisions to improve its predictive ability."
41253896,Machine learning glucose forecasting models for septic patients.,2025,"Sepsis-induced glucose fluctuations present major challenges in critical care, underscoring the importance of accurate glucose monitoring and forecasting to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a suite of forecasting models trained using continuous glucose monitoring data from a diabetic patient with sepsis (19,621 data points). The models include four transformer-based ones (iTransformer, Crossformer, PatchTST, FEDformer), a dynamic linear model (DLinear), and an ensemble zero-shot inference method leveraging ChatGPT-4. Model performance was evaluated for 15-, 30-, and 60-minute prediction horizons with an optimized 30-minute lookback window. PatchTST achieved the lowest mean maximum percentage error (MMPE) for short-term forecasts (3.0% at 15 minutes), while DLinear excelled at longer horizons (7.46% and 14.41% MMPE at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively). The ensemble ChatGPT-4 approach also showed competitive results. Overall, this work offers a toolbox of advanced forecasting models for ICU glucose prediction and management. The comprehensive comparison among the models highlights the promise of machine learning models-particularly DLinear and PatchTST-in supporting glucose monitoring and ultimately digital twin implementations, paving the way toward personalized and adaptive glycemic control in septic patients."
41253419,Utility of a C-Reactive Protein Declination Curve for Detecting Misadventure after Enterocutaneous Fistula Takedown: Opportunity for Early Detection?,2025,"Background: Enterocutaneous (EC) fistulae are a significant complication of abdominal surgery. The surgical takedown of EC fistulae carries a high risk of complications, including sepsis, recurrence, and mortality. Identifying biomarkers to detect complications early may improve outcomes. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation and tissue injury, has shown promise in predicting anastomotic leaks in colorectal surgery. This study evaluates the utility of post-operative CRP declination curves in detecting leaks after EC fistula takedown. Methods: This retrospective case series analyzed adult patients undergoing EC fistula takedown performed by a single surgeon at our institution over the past three years. Inclusion required documented EC fistulae, failure of nonoperative management, and at least three post-operative high-sensitivity CRP measurements. C-reactive protein, white blood cell (WBC), and temperature trends were analyzed alongside secondary outcomes: fistula recurrence, hospital stay, and complications. Results: Seven of 15 eligible cases met the inclusion criteria. C-reactive protein levels peaked immediately post-operatively and on average declined in patients without leaks, stabilizing by the second post-operative week. In patients with leaks, CRP levels deviated from this pattern, remaining elevated until managed. While WBC counts and temperatures showed variable trends, CRP demonstrated more consistent correlations with post-operative recovery and complications. Conclusion: High-sensitivity CRP may serve as a useful adjunct for early detection of post-operative leaks following EC fistula takedown. Preliminary findings support further prospective studies to validate CRP declination curves as a diagnostic tool, potentially improving monitoring and patient outcomes in this high-risk population."
41252950,Assessment of endocan as a prognostic biomarker in septic calves with diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli K99().,2025,"This study aimed to determine the prognostic impact of serum Endocan levels due to E. coli K99(+) driven systemic inflamatuary response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis (SE) and septic shock (SS). The samples were with 24 diarrhoeic calves and 8 health calves aged 0-7 days. The diarrhoeic calves were divided equally into three groups as the SS group, the SE group and the SIRS group. Repeated serum samples were collected at the 0th, 3rd and 6th hours. The collected samples were used to analyse Endocan and certain proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta ve IL-6) and acute phase proteins (SAA and Hp). A statistically meaningful difference was observed between the serum Endocan levels of the groups (P < 0.001). The E. coli infected diarrhoeic calves in the SS group had Endocan levels higher than others in other groups. Also, as a prognostic value, a statistically meaningful difference was observed between the repeated Endocan concentrations collected from dead and surviving calves (P < 0.01, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). When the cut-off point for Endocan 6th hour tests was considered > 131.92, the AUC value was 0.825, the sensitivity was %81.82, the specificity was %77.2, +LR: 3.60, -LR: 0.24 (P < 0.05). As a result, in repeated analysis, serum Endocan levels were shown to be a rigorous indicator of the severity of inflammation in diarrhoeic calves and mortality when the positive correlation between other proinflammatory cytokine and acute phase proteins was taken into consideration."
41252907,Plug-in paper biosensors for the rapid detection of multiple sepsis biomarkers in blood at the emergency department.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis can rapidly progress to life-threatening septic shock if specialized care is not provided promptly. In many cases, the first healthcare contact is a triage nurse, who assesses the urgency of medical evaluation. However, current triage protocols lack tools for accurate sepsis identification, potentially delaying critical interventions. RESULTS: We present Plug-In biosensors capable of simultaneous detecting two key sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), directly from blood samples. The biosensor integrates a cap that connects to a sample pad, enabling rapid, user-friendly operation suitable for point-of-care use in the Emergency Department. The sensors achieved limits of detection below clinical cut-offs to identify sepsis (0.2 ng mL(-1) for PCT and 0.1 pg mL(-1) for IL-6 in blood diluted 1:100). When applied to patients classified within triage levels 2 and 3 in an Emergency Department cohort, the biosensors demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. Notably, the biosensors successfully identified septic patients who experienced delays in consultation after triage. SIGNIFICANCE: Plug-In biosensors provide a rapid and accessible diagnostic platform for early sepsis detection at the point of triage. Their implementation could enable earlier activation of Code Sepsis, ensuring timely care for patients requiring urgent treatment."
41252746,Predicting Pediatric Sepsis and Mortality Using Wearable Device Data and Machine Learning in Bangladesh.,2026,"Sepsis disproportionately impacts children in low-resource settings, where diagnostic tools like the Phoenix Sepsis Score (PSS) are constrained by reliance on laboratory testing. The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of continuous physiological data from low-cost wearable biosensors and machine learning models to predict pediatric sepsis, septic shock, and mortality in a low-resource, intensive care setting. This prospective observational single-site study analyzed 96 pediatric intensive care unit patients with suspected sepsis in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Physiological data were collected using a wearable biosensor patch, whereas clinical exams, laboratory tests, and PSS criteria identified sepsis, septic shock, and mortality. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models were developed and validated through leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) using biosensor data. Our clinical diagnostic model for sepsis using biosensor-only features demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 (null AUROC = 0.58). For septic shock, the model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.85 (null AUROC = 0.61). The mortality model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.87 (null AUROC = 0.64). Sensitivity analyses showed improvement of AUROC to 0.89 for prediction of sepsis with manual recorded oxygen saturation (SpO2) included. Although models were trained and tested retrospectively with internal validation, findings demonstrate the potential of wearable biosensors to support pediatric sepsis diagnosis without reliance on advanced diagnostics. These results encourage further external validation with larger, multisite cohorts and real-time mobile health (mHealth) integration to support clinical use in low-resource settings."
41252431,"Serial C-reactive Protein and Blood Culture in the Diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis among Babies with Risk Factors for Sepsis at Uniosun Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis (NNS) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality among newborns, especially in developing countries. Early identification of risk factors is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to investigate utility of serial C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood culture in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis (NNS) among babies with risk factors for sepsis. METHODOLOGY: All consecutive term babies with maternal and/or neonatal risk factors for sepsis with or without initial symptoms were studied. Blood culture was done for all the participants. The CRP I was done at admission, CRP II at 48 hours and CRP III at 72 hours (a total of 3 samples). The value of CRP >/=10mg/l was considered abnormal. RESULTS: Of 106 participants, 35 (33%) had positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus aureus being the prevalent organism. The sensitivity of CRP at the cut off >/=10mg/l was 60%, 69.7%, and 66.7% for CRP I, CRP II and CRP III, with negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.6%,72.2% and 73.8%, respectively. Abnormal temperature, respiratory distress and convulsion at presentation were significantly associated with positive blood culture (p= 0.002, 0.014 and 0.009, respectively). Logistic regression identified abnormal temperature and delivery outside the hospital facility as being significantly related to elevated CRP values (p= 0.027, 0.016). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of utilization of serial CRP tests in the early detection of sepsis in neonates with risk factors."
41252417,PPI-based screening of hub genes related to sepsis migration/pyroptosis and immune infiltration analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis incidence is rising, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: Three GEO datasets (GSE154918, GSE32707, GSE54514) were analyzed after batch correction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and those related to pyroptosis/migration were cross-analyzed. Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG) and interaction networks (PPI, mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-TF, mRNA-drug) were constructed. External validation used GSE57065, excluding non-significant genes. ROC analysis and immune infiltration were performed. RESULTS: 3566 DEGs (1715 up, 1851 down) were identified, with 23 linked to pyroptosis/migration. Enrichment analysis highlighted roles in cell adhesion, cytokine regulation, and pathways like IL-17, TNF, and Toll-like receptor signaling. mRNA-miRNA interactions for 12 key genes were predicted. After validation, eight key genes remained: TLR2, SIRT1, PTGS2, MAPK14, IL18, ICAM1, CD274, and CASP3. Immune infiltration revealed varied effects on MAPK14. CONCLUSION: Key gene alterations may serve as sepsis biomarkers, and miRNA dysregulation could play a critical role in sepsis pathophysiology."
41248741,Interpretable machine learning based comorbidity specific mortality risk score for bloodstream infections.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of sepsis, necessitating early risk stratification during the critical window for effective management. We aimed to develop a model that leverages early-phase clinical data to predict 28-day mortality by integrating longitudinal trends and addressing comorbidity-driven heterogeneity. METHODS: The BSI Heterogeneity Score (BHScore) was developed using machine learning on longitudinal clinical data (first 7 days post-culture) from 2524 BSI patients at Xijing Hospital. The model uses interpretable methods to establish comorbidity-stratified thresholds (global, renal disease, liver disease, metastatic malignancy) to enhance prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The BHScore demonstrated superior discriminatory performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.81-0.91) and temporal stability compared to established scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), representing an improvement of 10% to 25%. Our analysis revealed that coagulation biomarkers have greater prognostic significance in the malignancy subgroup, inflammatory thresholds are more sensitive in the liver disease subgroup, and urea levels exhibit U-shaped mortality curves in the renal disease subgroup. To support clinical application, a freely accessible web tool has been developed. CONCLUSIONS: The BHScore enables the early identification of high-risk BSI patients with diverse comorbidities using straightforward clinical indicators, facilitating timely and targeted interventions to reduce mortality."
41248740,Monocyte iron load correlates with immune suppression and sepsis severity: A longitudinal analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection. In critically ill patients, iron biomarkers are closely linked to outcomes; yet the mechanistic role of iron metabolism in sepsis progression remains unclear. METHOD: To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal clinical study in 20 sepsis patients, tracking plasma iron biomarkers together with monocyte function and iron content over five consecutive days following sepsis onset. Some patients required red blood cell transfusions during the study period. RESULTS: We show that anemia of inflammation is an early and prominent feature of sepsis hallmarked by iron sequestration in blood monocytes, reduced plasma iron levels and anemia. Importantly, increased iron levels in monocytes are detected already at day one following the sepsis diagnosis and the degree of iron accumulation directly correlates with sepsis severity. High monocytic iron levels further correlate with decreased human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) expression on day one, suggestive of monocyte immunosuppression. Furthermore, in iron-loaded septic monocytes mRNA levels of the non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) transporter ZRT/IRT-like Protein 8 were significantly increased, suggesting enhanced uptake of non-transferrin bound iron that may arise from hemolysis. Interestingly, we also show that the total iron binding capacity is an important predictor of sepsis mortality, while transfusions did not correlate with an altered iron and/or inflammatory status. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that early iron accumulation in monocytes is a hallmark of sepsis and is closely linked to disease severity and progression. We expect that improved insights into iron metabolism in sepsis patients may pave the way to improving therapeutic options that balance iron levels and their effects on organ functions in the future."
41246299,Portfolio analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data unravels immune cells and telomere-related biomarkers in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of sepsis is essential to reducing mortality. Immune cells and telomeres play important roles in sepsis, but their mechanisms were still unclear. This study aimed to explore the value of immune cells and telomere-related genes in sepsis. METHODS: In this study, the transcriptomic data with sepsis and control samples were obtained from public database. Multiple methods including differential expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 101-machine learning algorithm combinations were used to identify biomarkers which related to the immune cells and telomere. Afterwards, a nomogram was constructed to assess the clinical predictive value of biomarkers. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), regulatory network construction and drug prediction analysis were adopted to demonstrate the role of biomarkers in sepsis. The key cells were also identified using a single-cell dataset. Finally, the expression of biomarkers was further validated in clinical samples by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: This study obtained a total of 4 biomarkers (MYO10, SULT1B1, MKI67, and CREB5), and the analysis of nomogram showed that the biomarkers had good clinical predictive value to sepsis. The enrichment analysis results revealed that the four biomarkers were enriched in the ribosome pathway. Besides, a lncRNAs-miRNAs-biomarkers network was constructed for the four biomarkers. Finally, we obtained a candidate drug (MS-275) and a key cell (CD16+ and CD14+ monocytes) respectively based on drug prediction and cell identification analysis. In addition, we found that the expression levels of CREB5 and SULT1B1 had significant changes during the process of key cell differentiation. The RT-qPCR results showed biomarkers were upregulated in the sepsis group, consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results. CONCLUSION: This study identified 4 biomarkers, namely MYO10, SULT1B1, MKI67, and CREB5 and explored the pathogenesis of sepsis, providing new insights for potential treatment strategies by integrating transcriptomic data and single-cell analysis."
41246143,Disulfidptosis-associated gene signatures in sepsis: a diagnostic model based on an LLM-assisted bioinformatics analysis.,2025,"PURPOSE: This study investigated the involvement of disulfidptosis in the pathophysiology of sepsis by applying a bioinformatics analysis assisted by large language models (LLMs). METHODS: Based on DeepSeek R1 and retrieval-augmented generation technology, a deep retrieval architecture was developed for extracting disulfidptosis-related genes. An intersection of genes from LLM extraction, manual extraction, and datasets was included for bioinformatics analyses. Using DeepSeek R1, we synthesized a multi-step bioinformatics protocol from prior publications. The analyses were then performed according to the protocol. Key gene candidates were identified using multiple machine learning models, and validation was performed in a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model of sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 21 disulfidptosis-related genes were included for bioinformatics analyses. Nine bioinformatics techniques were integrated based on the LLM summarization of two key references. Thirteen disulfidptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in sepsis. Based on these DEGs, sepsis patients were classified into two molecular subgroups with distinct immune profiles. Among the machine learning models evaluated, the support vector machine achieved the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.989). Five hub genes-FSTL1, SELP, PPBP, ITGA2B, and PF4-were selected as key biomarkers. Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated expression of these genes in the sepsis mice compared with their sham counterparts. CONCLUSION: Our study assisted bioinformatics analysis with large language models and revealed a critical role for disulfidptosis in sepsis. A high-performance diagnostic model was developed, and five genes were validated as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

41245863,Diagnostic utility of neurogenic biomarkers in differentiating sepsis with and without associated encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analytic approach.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent complication of sepsis, manifesting as acute brain dysfunction and often resulting in persistent cognitive deficits, neurological impairment, and increased mortality. Timely and accurate diagnosis of SAE is essential to guide therapeutic decisions and improve clinical outcomes. In recent years, neurogenic biomarkers have emerged as potential serum-based indicators for the diagnosis and progression monitoring of SAE. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted from inception to 30 April 2025. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies (50 arms) were included. Random-effects analysis revealed significant differences in serum NSE levels between SAE and NE adult patients (WMD = 6.82; 95% CI: 5.43, 8.21; P < 0.001), S100beta levels (WMD = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.60; P < 0.001), GFAP levels in the SAE group (WMD = 62.28; 95% CI: 45.42, 79.14; P < 0.001), TAU levels in the SAE individuals (WMD = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.51; P < 0.001), UCH-L1 levels in SAE patients (WMD = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.51; P < 0.001), APACHE II scores in the SAE group (WMD = 6.30; 95% CI: 4.61, 7.99; P < 0.001), and SOFA scores in SAE (WMD = 3.65; 95% CI: 2.96, 4.34; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum levels of neurogenic biomarkers may serve as potential predictors of SAE and are associated with increased mortality in septic patients. These biomarkers show promise as reliable, minimally invasive tools for diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of SAE. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to substantial heterogeneity across the included studies."
41245592,Alkaline Phosphatase to Albumin Ratio as a Novel Predictor of All-Cause Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase to albumin ratio (APAR) is an emerging prognostic indicator for sepsis, cancer, and coronary artery disease. However, the predictive value of APAR in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been investigated yet. Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between APAR and the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with AF. METHODS: The data of AF patients were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with AF were divided into three groups according to the APAR tertiles. Study outcomes were defined as 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare the survival rates between groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to investigate the association between APAR and all-cause mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to evaluate the predictive value of APAR for study outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1105 critically ill patients with AF were enrolled in the study. The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with the highest APAR had the lowest survival rate. The Cox regression analysis indicated that the highest APAR tertile was significantly associated with 28-day (HR, 1.64 [95% CI 1.20-2.25]; p=0.002) and 365-day (HR, 1.87 [95% CI 1.47-2.39]; p < 0.001) all-cause mortality. Nonlinear relationships between APAR and 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality were illustrated based on the RCS curves. The areas under the ROC curves for predicting 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality were 0.617 and 0.642, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggested that APAR was a simple biomarker for the prognosis in patients with AF."
41245394,Utility of Plasma Myostatin as a Predictive Biomarker for Post Intensive Care Syndrome in Patients With Sepsis.,2025,"AIM: Post intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a critical issue in postsepsis care; however, no reliable biomarker exists to predict PICS. We hypothesized that plasma myostatin, a cytokine involved in muscle and brain function, could serve as a predictive biomarker for PICS. METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study included adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Plasma myostatin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on days 1, 3-4, and 6-7 after sepsis diagnosis and ICU admission. PICS was assessed 6 months post-ICU discharge via telephone interviews using the Barthel Index, Short-Memory Questionnaire score, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine whether myostatin levels independently predicted PICS. Predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled (mean age: 71 +/- 14 years; median SOFA score 7 [IQR: 6-11]). Plasma myostatin concentrations were 544 (311-1015) pg/mL on day 1, 495 (302-651) pg/mL on days 3-4, and 536 (385-817) pg/mL on days 6-7. Decreased plasma myostatin levels on day 1 and on days 6-7 contributed to identifying patients with cognitive and physical impairments, respectively (p = 0.04). A decreased plasma myostatin level on day 1 yielded an AUC of 0.70 for predicting cognitive impairment, whereas the day 6-7 level yielded an AUC of 0.76 for predicting physical impairment. CONCLUSION: Lower plasma myostatin concentrations in the acute phase of sepsis may serve as a biomarker for predicting PICS-related physical and cognitive impairments."
41244772,Gut-lung immunometabolic crosstalk in sepsis: from microbiota to respiratory failure.,2025,"Sepsis is a systemic immune-metabolic disorder syndrome caused by infection, in which gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a central role in the occurrence and development of multi-organ dysfunction. This paper systematically elaborates on the bidirectional regulatory mechanism of the ""gut-lung axis"" in sepsis. Gut microbiota dysregulation damages the gut barrier function, reduces the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and increases endotoxin translocation. Subsequently, it activates alveolar macrophage polarization, promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and leads to an imbalance in the Treg/Th17 cell ratio, ultimately exacerbating the pathological process of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Conversely, the pulmonary inflammatory response can also aggravate gut barrier damage through circulating inflammatory mediators, forming a vicious cycle. Mechanistically, HIF-1alpha, mTOR, and Sirtuins do not act in isolation. Instead, they jointly regulate the metabolic fate of immune cells through spatiotemporally dynamic interactions. During the evolution of sepsis, these signals exhibit opposite regulatory polarities during the hyper-inflammatory phase and the immunosuppressive phase, and mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress further amplify the inflammatory cascade reaction. Preclinical research evidence shows that microbiota-based intervention measures (including probiotic preparations, fecal microbiota transplantation, and SCFA supplementation) and vagus nerve electrical stimulation can effectively alleviate sepsis-related lung injury and improve prognosis, but there is significant individual heterogeneity in their therapeutic effects. Future research should not be restricted to descriptive associations. Instead, it is essential to conduct in-depth analyses of the specific logic of the aforementioned signaling networks in terms of cell types, subcellular compartments, and disease course timings, and clarify their context-dependent controversies to promote the transformation of mechanistic understanding into precision treatment. Meanwhile, research efforts should focus on constructing a multi-omics dynamic biomarker system integrating metagenomics, metabolomics, and immunophenotyping analysis and designing clinical trials through precise patient stratification to facilitate the clinical translation of individualized treatment strategies based on gut-lung axis regulation."
41244407,"Fabrication of Disposable Thin-Film Electrodes via Shadow Mask Technique for Sensitive Point-of-Care Detection of C‑Reactive Protein, a Sepsis Biomarker.",2025,"Point-of-care testing for sepsis refers to diagnostic technologies that rapidly and effectively detect sepsis using specific biomarkers. The development of thin-film electrodes (TFEs) for biosensing applications has been frequently reported in recent years. Notably, TFEs have been employed to develop biosensors for C-reactive protein (CRP), a key biomarker of sepsis. This study presents a straightforward and rapid method for fabricating TFEs on substrates using a shadow mask technique. The process employs commercially available polyvinyl chloride sticker film, serving as a disposable shadow mask, to create a three-electrode system (working electrode (WE), counter electrode (CE), and reference electrode (RE) on a poly-(methyl methacrylate) substrate. The sequential deposition of 20 nm of titanium (Ti) and 120 nm of gold (Au) formed the WE and CE, while the RE was fabricated by depositing titanium and silver (Ag). The fabricated TFEs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, revealing notable differences in surface morphology and elemental composition. A specific aptamer for the CRP biomarker is immobilized on the surface of a TFE. The electrochemical biosensor demonstrated a linear range of 0.02-0.9 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 6.5 pg/mL, indicating high sensitivity for detecting the CRP biomarker."
41242037,Superiority of a combined antithrombin and activated protein C model for predicting coagulopathy and mortality in pneumonia-related sepsis: A prospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia-related sepsis is frequently complicated by coagulation disorders, which significantly increase mortality risk. The current ISTH criteria demonstrate limited sensitivity in diagnosing pneumonia-specific coagulopathy, and the mechanisms underlying clinical phenotypic heterogeneity remain poorly understood. There is a growing need to identify novel biomarkers that can enhance the early detection and stratification of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), particularly in its non-overt stages. AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (aPC) testing for predicting clinical deterioration and early DIC progression in adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 86 adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). All patients underwent testing of AT and aPC upon enrollment. The predictive value of this biomarker combination was evaluated for the development of overt DIC within 72 h and 28-day all-cause mortality using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Among 86 adults with severe pneumonia-related sepsis (median age 65 years; 56.9 % male), 18 (20.9 %) progressed to overt DIC within 72 h, and the 28-day mortality rate was 26.7 % (23/86). Compared with survivors, non-survivors exhibited significantly lower antithrombin activity (median 65 % vs. 78 %; P = 0.005) and higher activated protein C levels (median 127 pg/mL vs. 93.9 pg/mL; P < 0.001). Notably, the presence of overt DIC was the strongest predictor of mortality (OR = 144, 95 % CI: 18.66-1111.07). Similarly, patients with overt DIC exhibited markedly elevated aPC (P < 0.001). Among non-survivors, aPC was positively correlated with the 24-hour vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS; r = 0.567, P = 0.005). ROC analysis revealed that for predicting mortality, both aPC (AUC = 0.804, 95 % CI: 0.709-0.900) and the combined AT/aPC model (AUC = 0.814, 95 % CI: 0.714-0.913) significantly outperformed AT alone (AUC = 0.736, 95 % CI: 0.595-0.878).For predicting overt DIC, aPC (AUC = 0.859, 95 % CI: 0.778-0.939) and the combined model (AUC = 0.850, 95 % CI: 0.764-0.935) both demonstrated high accuracy. Notably, only the combined model effectively identified non-overt DIC (AUC = 0.850, 95 % CI: 0.768-0.932), whereas AT (AUC = 0.723) and aPC (AUC = 0.742) alone showed suboptimal performance. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this preliminary study identifies a combined AT/aPC model as a promising early predictor of DIC progression and mortality in pneumonia-sepsis. If validated in larger, multicentre cohorts, this simple two-biomarker approach provides a potential biomarker foundation for future studies investigating personalised anticoagulation strategies by identifying high-risk patients in the non-overt DIC stage."
41241236,Cytomegalovirus reactivation and the host immune response in patients with sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare host response profiles between sepsis patients who develop cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (reactivators) and those who do not (non-reactivators). METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study in CMV-seropositive sepsis patients from two Dutch ICUs. Reactivators (plasma CMV >/=100 IU/ml) were matched 1:1 to non-reactivators, based on length of stay until reactivation, disease severity, and other relevant criteria. We analysed 32 plasma biomarkers and whole-blood gene expression on the day of CMV reactivation (or matched time point for non-reactivators), three days prior, and at ICU admission. RESULTS: We compared 81 reactivators with 81 matched non-reactivators. In reactivators, six soluble immune checkpoint regulators increased longitudinally from three days before to the day of CMV viraemia onset. In contrast, biomarkers reflecting cytokine release, endothelial activation, coagulation, inflammation and organ damage remained stable. Structural equation modelling identified inhibitory checkpoint regulation as the only variable independently associated with CMV reactivation. Gene expression analysis three days before reactivation revealed upregulation of innate immunity, haemostasis, and CMV-related pathways, alongside downregulation of adaptive immunity and cytokine signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: CMV reactivation in sepsis is preceded by broad immune dysregulation. These data provide insight into antiviral immune mechanisms that are impaired prior to reactivation and may inform preventive strategies."
41240501,Associations of coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers with clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to acute infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the associations of coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers with clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. METHODS: Subjects (n=105) were selected from septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction treated between January 2022 and December 2024. Detection of coagulation function indicators [platelets (PLT), fibrinogen (Fib), and D-dimer (D-D)] and intestinal function impairment markers [endotoxin (ET) and d-lactate (d-Lac)] was completed on the day of admission. Patients were divided into two groups based on their 28 day survival status (dead or alive): a group of patients that died and survival group. RESULTS: The APACHE II score, SOFA score, D-D and d-Lac were influencing factors of clinical outcomes (P<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of Fib, D-D, ET and d-Lac alone and their combination for predicting death were 67.44%, 74.42%, 81.40%, 65.17% and 77.74%, and 75.81%, 74.19%, 67.74%, 75.81% and 83.87%, respectively, and the areas under the curves were 0.737, 0.815, 0.779, 0.748 and 0.868, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The coagulation function indicators and intestinal function impairment markers have associations with the clinical outcomes in septic patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction."
41240462,von Willebrand factor and fibrin monomer - induced septic shock coagulation typing: Clinical comparison between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - like syndrome and sepsis - induced coagulopathy with prognostic implications.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the pathological mechanisms, clinical features, and prognostic differences between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-like syndrome (TTP-like syndrome) and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) in patients experiencing septic shock. The findings will provide a basis for subtype-guided diagnosis and treatment of coagulation disorders. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort, 250 septic shock patients were divided into TTP-like syndrome (n = 101), SIC (n = 113), and control (n = 36) groups. Platelet count, vWF, FM, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and 28-day mortality were analyzed to compare coagulation phenotypes and outcomes. RESULTS: The TTP-like syndrome group was characterized by thrombocytopenia, with a median platelet (PLT) decline rate of 49.10 %. This group also exhibited markedly elevated vWF antigen levels, averaging 334.66 +/- 80.04 %. Additionally, all patients in this group presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at a rate of 100 %. In contrast, the SIC group demonstrated more severe platelet consumption, with a median PLT of 42 x 10(9)/L, elevated fibrinogen degradation product (FM) levels (median 9.22 mug/mL), and a significantly higher 28-day mortality rate (35.40 % vs. 11.88 % in the TTP-like group). The patterns of organ injury varied between the two groups; the SIC group displayed more pronounced liver (SOFA 1.43 +/- 1.08) and renal (SOFA 1.41 +/- 1.47) involvement, while the TTP-like syndrome group predominantly exhibited circulatory (SOFA 2.46 +/- 1.45) and respiratory (SOFA 2.53 +/- 0.76) dysfunction. vWF and FM had some predictive value for 28-day mortality, with area under the curve values of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. CONCLUSION: TTP-like syndrome and SIC represent heterogeneous coagulation phenotypes in septic shock, with differences in biomarkers, organ injury, and prognosis. A vWF- and FM-guided subtype classification may improve individualized treatment strategies and prognostic management."
41239342,Identification of protein biomarkers to differentiate between gram-negative and gram-positive infections in adults suspected of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is mostly caused by bacterial infections and requires a prompt diagnosis. There is a need for improved diagnostics by differentiating between gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. METHODS: The plasma levels of 285 unique proteins in patients with gram-negative infection (n = 154), gram-positive infection (n = 92), and in healthy controls (n = 35) were quantified using proximity extension assay. Three machine learning algorithms; random forest, recursive feature elimination, and adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were employed to identify discriminative proteins, with their effectiveness assessed using accuracy metrics. The selected proteins were further evaluated for their ability to differentiate between gram-negative and gram-positive infections through logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: We identified 55 discriminative proteins differentiating between gram-negative and gram-positive infections using the Lasso, the best performing algorithm. The discriminative proteins achieved AUROC values of 0.69 for gram-negative infections and 0.66 for gram-positive infections, both compared to the remaining groups, and 0.58 for differentiating between the two infection groups. Comparative statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in protein expression between gram-negative and gram-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 55 proteins with some discriminative potential between gram-negative and gram-positive infections. However, the overall predictive performance was low and did not exceed that of established single biomarkers. These findings highlight the challenges of applying a multimarker approach in infection classification and emphasize the need for further studies using larger and more diverse cohorts, as well as broader analytical methods, to explore their potential clinical utility. CLINICAL TRIAL: Not applicable. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-11973-5."
41239021,Predicting multiple organ failure after major orthopedic interventions is possible using only conventional laboratory tests.,2025,"PURPOSE: The decision to delay secondary, non-life-saving orthopedic surgery to reduce the risk of multiple organ failure (MOF) or sepsis is largely based on expert opinion. A decision-making tool may solve this problem by pre-operatively reflecting the patient's inflammatory/coagulation status. We aimed to determine whether the combination of readily available measures of inflammation and coagulation could predict MOF/sepsis in polytrauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-center study of adult trauma patients requiring pelvic/acetabular surgery. Patients were recruited from October 2011-January 2018. The primary outcome was postoperative MOF and sepsis. Full blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, complement C3 and C4, C-reactive protein, tryptase, cortisol, and interleukin-6 were collected preoperatively and 30 min, 1 day, and 3 days postoperatively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster the data within and across time. Logistic regression was used to predict MOF or sepsis using the top 4 principal components. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were recruited. The incidence of MOF and sepsis was 7% and 13%, respectively. PCA of preoperatively-collected immune and coagulation markers predicted MOF (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.94). Using routine tests alone predicted MOF with an AUC of 0.94. Sepsis was predictable with less accuracy than MOF from PCA (preoperative-AUC: 0.76). CONCLUSION: The routine clinical data available prior to non-life-saving definitive pelvic/acetabular surgery could predict MOF, and may serve as a tool for orthopedic surgeons to optimise the timing of surgery. Multi-centre, prospective investigation is required for validation."
41238749,Inflammatory markers predict bloodstream infections risk in hematological malignancy patients with chemotherapy induced neutropenia.,2025,"Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and febrile neutropenia (FN) significantly increase the risk of invasive infections, which can progress to septic shock or sepsis and may ultimately result in death. our purpose of this study is to construct a predictive model based on peripheral blood inflammatory markers to enable timely detection of bloodstream infections (BSI) and evaluation of infection severity in this population. A total of 112 patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) who developed BSI and 145 patients without BSI (NBSI) were included. Inflammatory marker levels were compared across subgroups. The Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for BSI within the training cohort. Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and diagnostic calibration curves. Patients with BSI had longer disease duration, a higher proportion of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and significantly lower levels of complete blood count and inflammatory markers compared to those without BSI. Univariate analysis identified prolonged disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, and reduced levels of NLR, MLR, PLR, SIRI, and SII as risk factors for BSI. A nomogram model was constructed incorporating disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, MLR, PLR, and SII. ROC and DCA indicated a broad threshold range for clinical applicability and a high net benefit of predictive model, supporting its clinical utility. Diagnostic calibration curves showed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test P-value of 0.3289. A nomogram model incorporating disease duration, hematologic diagnosis category, MLR, PLR, and SII was constructed and shown to provide a practical and effective tool for the assessment and early identification of BSI in patients with CIN."
41237320,Nanosensor-Based Pattern-Generating Probe Accelerates Sepsis Diagnosis.,2025,"Biomimetic optical sensor arrays hold promising potential in differentiating nuances within intricate mixtures and biosamples. Nonetheless, developing a standalone pattern-generating sensor for multianalyte identification in clinical biofluids, without the necessity of complicated synthesis, presents significant challenges. Here, we introduce a nanosensor-inspired sensor array (NanoSA), composed of a nanoassembly incorporating three sensors, that exhibits multiple intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effects. This pattern-generating nanoassembly, featuring six channels, parallel sensing, and rapid response, identifies 24 septic bacteria within 30 s (96.9% accuracy). Meanwhile, the nanoassembly shows excellent results in discriminating between multiplex bacterial infections, varying concentrations of bacteria, and those in diverse biofluids (serum and urine). Optimized by nine machine learning algorithms, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model achieved a 97.6% test accuracy in differentiating clinical sepsis samples infected by five distinct bacteria within 30 s, highlighting the potential of the NanoSA as a crucial tool for the rapid clinical diagnosis."
41237264,A LASSO-based integrative model of serum biomarkers and gene polymorphisms for predicting poor sepsis prognosis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The integration of serum biomarkers and gene polymorphisms may enhance early prognostic assessment in sepsis. Early and accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving survival. However, the clinical utility of combining genetic markers with conventional inflammatory indicators remains insufficiently validated. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort (n = 81; July 2022-July 2024), patients were grouped by 28-day outcome. Candidate genes (TLR4, PPARgamma, IL-12B, IL-27) were shortlisted from GSE54514. After data standardization and complete-case handling of < 5% missingness, ten-fold cross-validated LASSO selected predictors for multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by ROC AUC, Hosmer - Lemeshow (H - L) test, calibration plots, bootstrap optimism-correction (1,000 resamples), and decision-curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: 6 predictors were retained - PCT, CRP, lactate (LAC), lactate clearance rate (LCR), TLR4 rs4986790, and PPARgamma rs1801282. The nomogram achieved AUC 0.885 (95% CI 0.812-0.943) with sensitivity 88.6% and specificity 73.9%; calibration was good (H - L chi(2) = 9.191, p = 0.156). Bootstrap-corrected AUC was 0.872, with calibration slope 0.97 and Brier score 0.165. DCA indicated higher net benefit than SOFA or APACHE II across 0.05-0.40 threshold probabilities. In benchmarking, the integrative model outperformed SOFA and APACHE II (DeltaAUC 0.129 and 0.104; DeLong p = 0.004 and 0.009) and showed higher net benefit on decision-curve analysis across 0.05-0.40 threshold probabilities. CONCLUSION: This integrative biomarker-genotype model demonstrated strong internal performance and potential clinical utility for individualized risk stratification in sepsis. The results support combining genetic susceptibility and inflammatory biomarkers for enhanced prognostic precision, although external and multi-ethnic validation remains warranted before widespread adoption."
41236912,Diagnostic utility of procalcitonin for detecting bacteremia in persons who inject drugs.,2025,"AIM: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are prone to bloodstream infections, but diagnosis is often delayed. This study evaluated the utility of admission serum procalcitonin for early detection of bacteremia. METHODS: A total of 131 adult male PWID admitted with suspected sepsis were prospectively enrolled. RESULTS: Bacteremia was confirmed in 52 (39.7%) cases, primarily due to Staphylococcus aureus and S. haemolyticus. Infective endocarditis was the leading diagnosis among bacteremic patients. Procalcitonin levels >/=0.51 ng/mL demonstrated high sensitivity (88.5%) and negative predictive value (82.9%), but low specificity (36.7%), resulting in limited diagnostic utility (area under the curve [AUC] 0.613). C-reactive protein (AUC 0.680) and serum albumin (AUC 0.723) outperformed procalcitonin. In-hospital mortality was 35.1%. CONCLUSION: Admission procalcitonin has limited diagnostic value for detecting bacteremia in PWID."
41234615,Wearable vital-sign sensors for early detection of severe dengue and sepsis: Clinical applications and implementation in resource-limited settings.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Severe dengue and sepsis account for tens of millions of cases and deaths annually in low-resource settings, where spot-check vital sign monitoring misses early physiological deterioration. Affordable wearable sensors that stream continuous data and feed machine learning algorithms promise earlier detection and improved outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a structured narrative literature review of human studies on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar that evaluated wearable vital-sign devices for predicting severe dengue or sepsis in resource-limited areas. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted, and synthesized data on study design, devices, vital streams, predictive performance, and implementation barriers. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies (2019-2024) from Vietnam, Rwanda, Bangladesh, and South Korea tested photoplethysmography or single-lead electrocardiography wearables in intensive care units and emergency departments of hospitals. The algorithms achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83-0.86 for forecasting dengue shock up to 2 hours and sepsis deterioration up to 5-48 hours before conventional recognition. The precision reached 0.79 for the three-level dengue severity classification. Continuous monitoring reduces the time to intervention and matches or exceeds the accuracy of manual charting. CONCLUSION: Early evidence shows that low-cost wearable sensors can deliver clinically meaningful lead times for severe dengue and sepsis in developing countries' hospitals. However, generalizability, artifact suppression, power autonomy, and economic sustainability remain unproven. Multicentre pragmatic trials, edge-optimized algorithms, and full cost-effectiveness analyses are needed before routine adoption."
41234516,Personalized machine learning-based prognostic model for ICU-acquired bloodstream infections.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections (ICU-BSIs) are among the most prevalent healthcare-associated infections and a major cause of mortality among ICU patients. We developed a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict the prognosis of ICU-BSIs. METHODS: Adult patients with blood cultures drawn >/=48 hours after ICU admission were included: the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (AMU, China) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, USA). The AMU dataset was used for model training and internal validation, and the MIMIC-IV dataset served as the external validation set. The model incorporated routinely collected, easily obtainable clinical variables, including several representing the average rate of change in laboratory indicators. After comparing multiple algorithms, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was selected and optimized using cross-validation and grid search. RESULTS: A total of 1,903 patients from AMU and 3,496 from MIMIC-IV were included. In both cohorts, antibiotic duration, platelet count, serum creatinine, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were significantly associated with 28-day mortality (P < 0.001). The XGBoost model using 33 variables showed strong discrimination, with an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94) for training and 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.90) for internal validation. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified the 10 most important variables; a simplified model using these maintained good accuracy, with AUROC values of 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.85) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.70-0.73) for the internal and external validation sets, respectively. In pathogen subgroups, the internal AUROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.93) for Gram-positive (Gram+) and Gram-negative (Gram-) infections, with external validation AUROCs of 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.77) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.62-0.82), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a personalized ML-based prognostic model for ICU-BSIs using multicenter time-series data. This model may facilitate early identification of high-risk patients, enabling timely intervention and optimized ICU resource allocation."
41233414,Machine learning prediction of mortality in pediatric fungemia using the Candida score.,2025,"Pediatric fungemia in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) carries high mortality. We evaluated whether the Candida Score, combined with clinical variables, predicts mortality after diagnosis using a prespecified multivariable logistic regression (primary model) and benchmarked discrimination against Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine. We analyzed 85 pediatric fungemia cases from a PICU (2016-2020). The prespecified primary model was multivariable logistic regression with predefined covariates; Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine were exploratory comparators. Discrimination was evaluated on a held-out test set and by 10-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping. In 85 cases, the median age was 6 months and median weight 4.8 kg; 62.4% were male. Candida albicans was the most prevalent species (37.6%). Of the subjects, 39 (45.9%) died and 46 (54.1%) survived. On the held-out test set (n = 17), logistic regression achieved accuracy 0.735 and AUC 0.800. Random Forest achieved AUC 0.861 (precision 1.000; recall 0.778), and Gradient Boosting achieved AUC 0.847 (precision 0.875; recall 0.778). Internal validation (10-fold cross-validation and bootstrap resampling) supported model stability.Conclusion Integrating the Candida Score with clinical predictors shows potential for mortality risk stratification after fungemia diagnosis. In this single-center cohort, Random Forest yielded the highest discrimination on the test set. Findings are exploratory and require external validation in larger, multicenter studies before clinical use."
41231552,Dual-mode electrochemical-colorimetric immunosensor based on an integrated FeOOH-Au-MB probe for sensitive procalcitonin detection.,2025,"The integration of a dual-mode detection mechanism into immunosensing analysis technology can significantly enhance detection accuracy. However, the construction process is complex due to the differences in analysis principles, posing substantial technical challenges in the coordinated adaptation of multiple principles. We developed a novel dual-mode immunosensor based on ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) microboxes modified with gold nanoparticles and loaded with methylene blue into a multifunctional FeOOH-Au-MB probe which does not require any additional reagents. In the electrochemical detection mode, the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of the FeOOH microboxes prepared at room temperature can efficiently bind to the electron mediator methylene blue, achieving significant amplification of the electrochemical signal. In the colorimetric detection mode, the Fe(3+) ions released from the FeOOH microboxes react with ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](4-)) to form Prussian blue, resulting in a visible color change. The dual-mode self-calibration function can enhance the reliability and sensitivity of detection. Under optimal detection conditions, it exhibits a wide detection range from 1.0 pg mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1) for the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin (PCT), with detection limits of 0.28 pg mL(-1) (electrochemical mode) and 0.42 pg mL(-1) (colorimetric mode). The dual-mode immunosensor based on FeOOH-Au-MB could be used for clinical diagnosis, providing a potential tool for medical professionals."
41230775,Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II: Significantly Elevated in Obstructive Jaundice and Sepsis Patients Without Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,2025,"BACKGROUND: PIVKA-II is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC. However, a particular PIVKA-II variant can be abnormally elevated in patients with obstructive jaundice or sepsis, complicating its interpretation in HCC conditions. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the distribution and positive rates of serum PIVKA-II and AFP in patients with obstructive jaundice or sepsis, and to explore their relationships with laboratory tests, particularly coagulation function indexes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off, specificity and sensitivity of PIVKA-II in diagnosing HCC. RESULTS: In patients with obstructive jaundice and sepsis, PIVKA-II was significantly positively correlated with PT and INR. When the cut-off was 42.17 mAU/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of PIVKA-II in diagnosing HCC were 74.69% and 70.17%, respectively. There was no difference in PIVKA-II concentration between HCC and obstructive jaundice. PIVKA-II levels in obstructive jaundice and sepsis were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Except for healthy individuals, the positive rate of serum PIVKA-II was significantly higher than that of AFP among the other three groups, and patients with obstructive jaundice had the highest positive rate of PIVKA-II. CONCLUSIONS: The PIVKA-II produced by HCC may differ from that produced by obstructive jaundice and sepsis. Given that PIVKA-II levels are abnormally elevated in patients with obstructive jaundice and sepsis, the results should be interpreted with caution in patients with HCC combined with these diseases."
41229934,Lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio as a predictor of 28-day mortality in critically Ill patients with gastrointestinal cancers: Insights from machine learning and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LDAR) predicts 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies and to quantify its incremental value in machine learning (ML) models. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Medical Information Mart For Intensive Care IV (2008-2019). Adults with GI malignancies who met Sepsis-3 within 24 h of their first intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. LDAR was computed from laboratory results obtained within 24 h. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Associations were estimated with multivariable logistic regression; nonlinearity was evaluated using restricted cubic splines. Multiple ML classifiers (AdaBoost, XGBoost, random forest) were trained with a 7:3 split and 5-fold cross-validation. Discrimination (area under the curve-AUC), clinical utility (decision-curve analysis), and interpretability (Shapley additive explanation-SHAP) were assessed. Prespecified subgroup analyses stratified by metastatic status and infection site were performed. Covariates included age, sex, weight, vital signs, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and metastatic status. Missingness was handled with multiple imputation by chained equations. RESULTS: Among 1177 patients, 28-day mortality was 48.4%. Higher LDAR was independently associated with death; the adjusted odds ratio for Q4 vs Q1 was 5.15 (95% CI 3.52-7.61; P < 0.001). Spline analyses showed a steep risk rise above log2(LDAR) = 5.314 ( approximately 40). Effects were directionally consistent across subgroups with no significant LDAR x metastatic interaction (P = 0.084) and borderline heterogeneity by infection site (P = 0.051). The best ML model, AdaBoost, achieved an AUC of 0.835 and yielded the largest net clinical benefit across clinically relevant thresholds. SHAP ranked LDAR among the most influential predictors. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure codings produced concordant estimates. Model calibration was acceptable. CONCLUSION: LDAR is a simple, interpretable, and independently prognostic biomarker for 28-day mortality in ICU patients with GI malignancies. Incorporating LDAR into ML models improved discrimination and decision benefit over conventional severity scores, supporting LDAR-based early risk stratification. External multicenter validation and evaluation of dynamic LDAR trajectories are warranted, and transparent analytic reporting."
41229929,Decoding sepsis: A technical blueprint for an algorithm-driven system architecture.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in healthcare, requiring rapid detection and intervention. This paper presents a scalable, serverless machine learning (ML) operations architecture for near real-time sepsis risk-stratification in Emergency Department (ED) waiting rooms, where pathology data is often unavailable and recognising sepsis presents the biggest opportunity for timely treatment. METHODS: The system integrates HL7 message processing through MuleSoft in a secure Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment, leveraging AWS services such as Lambda for real-time data processing and SageMaker for ML model deployment. To optimise the model's performance, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate different cutoff thresholds of probability across different age groups (16-35, 35-65, and 65-115), aiming for >80% sensitivity and minimise false negatives. Processed data is stored in Aurora PostgreSQL Relational Database Service and visualised in an on-premises proprietary dashboard for clinical decision support. RESULTS: Despite high reliability, with 99.7% of HL7 messages successfully processed, limitations include occasional failures due to downtime and code set mismatches, as well as peak execution times of 10.5 s under heavy loads, highlighting areas for optimisation. Model development of eligible ED encounters (n =  484,617) using XG Boost was integrated as a real-time endpoint in SageMaker. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.84) and F1-score (0.80), with balanced sensitivity and specificity for our specified limited features within an ED. ROC for age groups (16-35, 36-65, 66-115), showed strong performance in all cohorts (AUCs: 0.864, 0.867, 0.806). CONCLUSION: This paper outlines the system's design, implementation, and potential for enhancing early sepsis risk-stratification through near real-time monitoring in the ED waiting room."
41229676,"Bidirectional Regulatory Roles in the Immune Modulation, Organ Dysfunction, and Therapy of Sepsis.",2025,"Exosomes have emerged as central mediators in sepsis pathogenesis and therapy. Exosomes play an important role in cell communication by transferring functional proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids to recipient cells. Recently, Low-immunogenic exosomes serve as novel biomarkers in sepsis, and they confer a 46% enhancement in survival benefit in animal models. However, exosomes drive the early inflammatory storm and late immune paralysis in sepsis. There are also limitations related to heterogeneity and translational barriers. Therefore, this review discusses the basic signaling pathways underlying the bidirectional effects of exosomes in the pathogenesis and treatment of sepsis, the interaction between organ dysfunction and exosomes in sepsis, the current progress in exosome therapy for sepsis, as well as the challenges and limitations faced in this field. In summary, exosomes have bright prospects in diagnosis and clinical translation, as well as the potential for standardized production."
41229649,From Crisis to Recovery: Life-Saving IgM-Enriched Immunoglobulin Rescue Therapy in Severe CAP and Refractory Post-Partum Septic Shock - A Dramatic 24-Hour Turnaround.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock in the postpartum period is a life-threatening condition associated with significant mortality. The physiological changes of pregnancy and the puerperium often complicate diagnosis and treatment, making timely, effective intervention critical. When conventional antimicrobial therapy fails, alternative therapeutic strategies become essential. Recent systematic reviews have highlighted the potential benefits of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin in reducing mortality among sepsis patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 25-year-old previously healthy woman who developed severe septic shock following caesarean section delivery. The clinical picture was complicated by influenza A pneumonia and a urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli. Despite administration of broad-spectrum standard antimicrobial treatments, the patient exhibited rapid clinical deterioration, with escalating vasopressor requirements and severe hyperinflammation. Biomarkers were profoundly elevated, including a procalcitonin level of 386.2 ng/ml and a C-reactive protein of 424 mg/l. Given the failure of standard therapy and the critical condition, IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin((R))) was administered as a rescue therapy. Within 24 hours of infusion, the patient demonstrated significant clinical and biochemical improvement, with normalisation of vital signs, reduced inflammatory markers and early weaning from vasopressors. She achieved full recovery and rapid hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential life-saving role of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin and its potential therapeutic value in managing refractory postpartum sepsis and severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While promising, the timing, dosage and patient selection for this therapy require further clinical investigation, particularly in obstetric populations. LEARNING POINTS: IgM-enriched immunoglobulin therapy represents a viable adjunctive option for refractory sepsis, particularly in hyperinflammatory presentations. Early therapeutic intervention within 24 hours of refractory status may optimise clinical outcomes.Phenotype-based therapy selection can identify patients most likely to benefit from immunomodulatory interventions. Postpartum patients may experience worse outcome due to pregnancy-related immune modifications.Biomarker monitoring including procalcitonin and C-reactive protein can guide therapeutic decisions and evaluate treatment response."
41229429,Diagnostic efficiency of inflammatory signatures to distinguish isolated candidemia from candidemia with bacterial co-infection.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: To identify the differences in inflammatory response between critically ill patients responding to combined bacterial-fungal sepsis and those with isolated fungal sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study compared ICU patients who were exposed (n=24) and unexposed (n=20) to candidemia. Two exposure modes were analyzed: isolated candidemia (C; n=12) versus candidemia with bacterial co-infection (BC; n=12). Targeted proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to examine differences in serum inflammatory proteome between groups. Differential inflammatory proteins served as input for a logistic regression model to validate their effectiveness in discrimination. RESULTS: Two major clusters-candidemia cases and controls-were identified based on differential protein expression analysis. In five-fold cross-validation, LAP-TGF beta-1 was identified as the main driver, effectively distinguishing isolated candidemia [AUC 0.95; 95% CI 0.853-1.000]. TRANCE and IL-17C showed potential as a diagnostic signature indicating bacterial co-infection in the context of candidemia. DISCUSSION: The three-protein logistic regression panel (LAP-TGF beta-1, TRANCE and IL-17C) differentiated cases with isolated candidemia from those with candidemia and bacterial co-infection [AUC 0.82; 95% CI 0.629-0.968]. A three-protein inflammatory signature distinguished isolated fungal sepsis from combined bacterial-fungal sepsis. This study is the first to explore the inflammatory response to differentiate isolated candidemia from candidemia with bacterial co-infection."
41229414,Circulating NETs enable early identification of thrombotic risk in sepsis at emergency care onset.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis involves a dysregulated host response to infection and is frequently complicated by coagulopathy, contributing to organ dysfunction and mortality. Early detection of coagulation disturbances in the emergency department (ED) remains clinically challenging. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have emerged as key mediators linking inflammation and thrombosis in sepsis, yet their prognostic value during early care is unclear. This study aimed to assess whether circulating NETs measured at sepsis onset are associated with inflammatory biomarkers, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) status, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 212 adult patients with sepsis recruited at the ED presentation. Plasma NETs, IL-6, and MR-ProADM were measured by ELISA. The ISTH SIC score was used to identify early-stage coagulopathy. RESULTS: Circulating NETs were detected in 61 patients (28.8%) and higher NETs levels were significantly associated with elevated D-dimer, LDH, IL-6, PCT, and hypocholesterolemia. NETs positive patients had increased odds of positive blood cultures (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), thromboembolic events (OR = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.0-19.0), and SOFA >/= 5 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-2.9). Among 202 patients with complete data to SIC evaluation, 49% met SIC criteria. Although NETs were not independently associated with SIC, their inflammatory and clinical impact was significantly amplified in SIC-positive patients, suggesting a synergetic interaction between NETosis and early coagulopathy. DISCUSSION: NETs quantification at ED presentation may help identify a high-risk immunothrombotic phenotype in sepsis and support earlier NETosis-targeted therapies alongside anticoagulation."
41228476,"Lactoferrin, a Natural Protein with Multiple Functions in Health and Disease.",2025,"Lactoferrin is a multifunctional glycoprotein showing multiple biological properties (antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, antigenotoxic, prebiotic, probiotic) that play an essential role in maintaining host physiological homeostatic condition by exerting immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Thanks to these biological properties, lactoferrin has widely been studied as a therapeutic agent in gastroenteric diseases, neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, lung diseases, and COVID-19, showing very heterogeneous results based on the disease considered and the population studied. Since lactoferrin is one of the main components of neutrophils' secondary granules, it has also been investigated as a potential disease-monitoring biomarker, especially for diseases in which inflammation is a key component. This narrative review offers updated and comprehensive insights into the available literature on lactoferrin biology, biological properties, and clinical utility."
41227253,Relationship Between Retinal Vascular Measurements and Anthropometric Indices in Patients Diagnosed with Persistent COVID-19.,2025,"Introduction: Persistent COVID-19 is associated with microvascular dysfunction, with retinal vessels as potential early biomarkers. Obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, contributes to this dysfunction; however, the body mass index (BMI) is limited in its ability to assess it. Therefore, more precise alternative anthropometric indices have been proposed, although their relationship with retinal vascular caliber in persistent COVID-19 has not been studied. Objective: To analyze the relationship between different anthropometric measurements and the caliber of retinal vessels in an adult population with persistent COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study and included individuals diagnosed with persistent COVID-19. Retinal images were obtained using a non-mydriatic retinograph. The anthropometric variables used included: waist and hip circumference, BMI, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), Body Roundness Index (BRI), Abdominal Volume Index (AVI), and body composition parameters measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: The sample included 284 participants (mean age: 52.7 years; 31.8% men). Men exhibited greater general and abdominal adiposity. The AV Index was negatively associated with various anthropometric indicators (BMI, BRI, waist circumference, and AVI), while venular caliber showed positive associations with all these indices, except for BMI (p < 0.05 for all). No significant correlations were found between anthropometric values and arteriolar caliber. These associations persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and pharmacological treatment. Conclusions: Individuals with obesity are associated with alterations in retinal vessels in patients with persistent COVID-19, evidenced by an increase in venous caliber and a decrease in the AV Index. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously."
41226345,Association of NOS Gene Polymorphisms with Sepsis-Related Complications in Secondary Peritonitis.,2025,"Secondary peritonitis (SP) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high complication rates and it often results in sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. This study investigated the association between four nitric oxide synthase (NOS) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-NOS3 c.-786T>C (rs2070744), NOS3 c.894G>T (rs1799983), NOS3 27 bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) (rs61722009), and NOS2 (rs2297518)-and sepsis-related complications in 202 patients with SP. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, Mannheim Peritonitis Index, and complications (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), multiple organ failure (MOF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis) were analyzed for associations with the NOS gene variants. Haplotype analysis was also performed. No SNP showed an association with in-hospital mortality. However, the NOS3 c.-786T>C TT genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of MOF (p = 0.008), and remained independently associated after multivariate adjustment (p(MOF) = 0.006). The T4bG haplotype was significantly more frequent among patients with MODS (p = 0.026), MOF (p = 0.048), and sepsis (p = 0.018). These findings suggest that NOS gene variants, particularly NOS3 c.-786T>C and the T4bG haplotype, may potentially serve as biomarkers for risk stratification in critically ill patients."
41225969,"Clinical Value of Galectin-9, Soluble TREM-1, and Soluble CD25 Among Critically Ill Patients with Organ Failure in the Emergency Department: A Prospective Observational Study.",2025,"Background/Objectives: This study investigated clinical value of galectin-9 (Gal-9), a soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), and soluble CD25 (sCD25) among critically ill patients with organ failure in the emergency department. Methods: Overall, 786 patients were enrolled and classified into non-infectious organ failure (NIOF, n = 331), sepsis (n = 266), and septic shock (n = 189). The diagnostic value of Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the biomarkers was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox proportional hazard model analyses. Results: Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 could discriminate sepsis from NIOF (Gal-9, area under the curve [AUC], 0.599-0.678; sTREM-1, AUC, 0.616-0.695; sCD25, AUC, 0.710-0.781) and septic shock from sepsis (Gal-9, AUC, 0.562-0.667; sTREM-1, AUC, 0.572-0.676; sCD25, AUC, 0.555-0.660), respectively. Sepsis patients with higher levels of biomarkers over their cut-off value showed higher 30-day mortality compared to those with lower levels below the cut-off value (Gal-9 >/= 14,391.80 ng/L, p < 0.001; sTREM-1 >/= 580.62 ng/L, p < 0.001; sCD25 >/= 1639.29 ng/L, p < 0.001; respectively) (log-rank test). sCD25 is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Conclusions: Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 showed diagnostic and prognostic value in critically ill patients with organ failure. sCD25 can predict the 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Gal-9, sTREM-1, and sCD25 could serve as auxiliary biomarkers to support clinicians in effective sepsis management."
41225524,Platelet parameters as potential biomarkers for sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a major global health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited diagnostic resources. This meta-analysis evaluates platelet index ratios (mean platelet volume-to-platelet count, MPV/PLT; platelet distribution width-to-platelet count, PDW/PLT; and platelet distribution width-to-plateletcrit, PDW/PCT) as cost-effective biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for studies evaluating platelet parameter ratios in sepsis. Inclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) cohort/case-control designs; (2) non-duplicated datasets; (3) available quantitative data for meta-analysis. Exclusion criteria included reviews, abstracts, letters to the editor, and studies with incomplete data. Synthesis methods employed random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) and diagnostic metrics (sensitivity, specificity, etc.), with heterogeneity assessed via I-squared statistics. Publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. The results revealed that MPV/PLT ratios were significantly higher in neonatal (SMD = 1.48, P = 0.004) and adult sepsis patients (SMD = 0.35, P < 0.001) than in controls. Survivors had significantly lower MPV/PLT ratios than non-survivors in both children/neonate (SMD = 0.67, P < 0.01) and adult group (SMD = 0.41, P < 0.01), with similar trends observed in longitudinal assessments. PDW/PLT was also lower in pediatric survivors (P = 0.009), while no significant differences were found for MPV/PCT in neonates or PDW/PLT in adults. For diagnosing sepsis, MPV/PLT had a sensitivity of 0.55 and specificity of 0.71 in adults, and 0.58 and 0.87 in neonates. For predicting mortality, neonatal sepsis showed higher sensitivity (89%) and specificity (73%) than adult sepsis (63%, 58%). In LMICs, MPV/PLT was elevated at admission in both age groups but was linked to survival only in neonates. CONCLUSION: The MPV/PLT ratio shows promise as a cost-effective biomarker for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis, particularly in neonatal patients, with important potential applications in LMICs. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: This study has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY) (Registration Number: INPLASY202540096). https://doi.org/10.37766/inplasy2025.4.0096 ."
41225313,The effectiveness of unfractionated heparin vs. low molecular weight (Enoxaparin) in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom (ARDS) and metabolic dysfunction: an old drug for new indication!,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a lung disorder defined by the acute onset of hypoxemia, the commonest being abdominal sepsis.Many biomarkers have been studied for diagnostic prognostication and ARDS pharmacotherapy. The current study aim to assess the protective effects of UFH versus Enoxaparin in sepsis-induced ARDS and related metabolic sequelae. METHODS: Sepsis was initiated through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Wistar rats were divided to: sham, CLP, CLP + unfractionated Heparin, and CLP + Enoxaparin and CLP + distilled water groups. Levels of serum Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leukotriene E4 (LTE4), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), interleukin-8 (IL-8), were quantified. Furthermore, mRNA expression of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) were assessed. Histopathological study was conducted to assess any lung injuries. RESULTS: Septic rats demonstrated higher levels of leukotriene E4, leukotriene B4, and interleukin-8, while treatment with unfractionated Heparin attenuated these levels but enoxaparin effectiveness on LTB-4 and IL-8 was not as significant as heparin while its was equally effective on LTE-4. Moreover, mRNA levels of RAGE and ANG-2 were enhanced in CLP rats. These elevations were mitigated by treatment with unfractionated Heparin and reduced by enoxaparin to a lesser extent. Treatment with unfractionated Heparin increased the lipoxin A4 and lipoprotein lipase levels but enoxaparin had no effect on the LPL level. Lung protective effect of unfractionated Heparin was further confirmed by histopathological observations of lung tissue samples. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that UFH can modulate ARDS and metabolic dysfunction in hyperinflammatory conditions like sepsis."
41224189,A novel Gasdermin D C-terminal neo-epitope as a biomarker for pyroptosis in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis, a critical component of the innate immune response, is triggered by pathogenic microbial infections and plays a key role in host defense mechanisms. This process involves the cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases, releasing carboxy-terminal fragments (GSDMD-CT). Monitoring GSDMD-CT levels represents a promising approach for inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). METHODS: We developed an immunoassay to measure plasma GSDMD-CT concentrations in 109 healthy individuals, 137 patients with SIRS, and 100 patients with sepsis. The diagnostic utility of GSDMD-CT in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS or healthy controls was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, alongside correlations with procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Plasma GSDMD-CT levels were significantly elevated in patients with sepsis compared to healthy control and SIRS groups. ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.870, with a sensitivity of 91.0% and specificity of 60.6% for differentiating sepsis from healthy controls. Comparable performance was observed in distinguishing SIRS from healthy controls. Diagnostic accuracy was further enhanced when GSDMD-CT was combined with CRP. Strikingly, GSDMD-CT mirrored the kinetic profile of PCT in antibiotic-treated patients with bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: The GSDMD-CT assay demonstrates high sensitivity as a biomarker, offering potential for early and differential diagnosis of sepsis across diverse pathogens."
41221805,Machine learning for personalized antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoints.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Infection diagnoses are critical to the personalized interpretation of EUCAST aminopenicillin breakpoints for Enterobacterales, but microbiology laboratories cannot predict diagnosis when specimens are received. Here, we assess whether machine learning could facilitate personalized antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoint reporting by predicting urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnoses. METHODS: XGBoost models were trained using open-source electronic healthcare record data to predict complicated UTI in patients with Enterobacterales bacteriuria and to predict UTI in patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia. These models were validated and used to provide simulated aminopenicillin dosing/regimen recommendations based on antimicrobial susceptibility results for patients with bacteriuria and bacteraemia in a holdout dataset. The main outcomes were the proportions of patients recommended appropriate aminopenicillin dosages/regimens according to EUCAST guidelines based on their diagnosis. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.62 for predicting both complicated UTI in patients with bacteriuria and UTI in patients with bacteraemia. In the simulation study, 79.3% (n = 276) and 72.7% (n = 8) of patients with ampicillin-susceptible Enterobacterales bacteriuria and bacteraemia, respectively, were recommended appropriate aminopenicillin dosages/regimens for their infection diagnosis according to EUCAST guidelines. Adjusting the probability threshold for predicting complicated UTI increased the proportion of appropriate recommendations in bacteriuria to 96.6% (n = 336). CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning models to predict the probability of complicated UTI in patients with bacteriuria and the probability of UTI in patients with bacteraemia resulted in appropriate aminopenicillin dosages/regimens being recommended in most cases. These results provide proof-of-concept for how machine learning could facilitate the personalized implementation of EUCAST aminopenicillin breakpoints."
41221756,A Case of Septic Shock Complicated by Abnormal Thyroid Hormone Levels.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe illness induces large changes in thyroid hormone economy. Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as low T3 syndrome, refers to thyroid hormone alterations induced by systemic or consumptive non-thyroidal diseases. These alterations strongly correlate with disease severity but are often overlooked in clinical practice. METHODS: Here we report a case of septic shock complicated by abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels. The patient presented with markedly reduced triiodothyronine (T3) and free triiodothyronine (fT3), profoundly suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and elevated free thyroxine (fT4) levels - a rare biochemical profile in clinical settings. Laboratory confirmation of significantly elevated rT3 levels established the diagnosis of low T3 syndrome. The transient fT4 elevation likely results from profound TSH suppression combined with sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokines, which directly inhibit D2 activity, alongside reduced thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels during the acute phase. The patient's TH levels normalized following resolution of sepsis symptoms. RESULTS: The patient exhibited markedly reduced T3 and fT3 levels with profoundly suppressed TSH and elevated rT3, consistent with NTIS rather than primary hypothyroidism. Transiently elevated fT4 may manifest in NTIS. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that when detecting reduced T3 with suppressed TSH in septic patients, clinicians should consider NTIS as a potential diagnosis. Measurement of rT3 and serial monitoring of TH levels are advised to avoid inappropriate therapeutic interventions."
41220037,Unravelling butyrate metabolism in sepsis: identification of key genes.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an infection-induced systemic inflammatory response. Given the potential link between changes in butyrate metabolism (BM) and sepsis development, this study aimed to preliminarily identify potential BM-related genes and explore their possible relevance to sepsis treatment strategies. METHODS: The GSE54514, GSE175453 and GSE65682 datasets, as well as BM-related genes (BMRGs), were obtained from public databases. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained through differential expression analysis were intersected with BMRGs to acquire candidate genes. The key genes were obtained using two machine learning algorithms and expression verification. A series of analyses of key genes were subsequently conducted, including Friends analysis, enrichment analysis, impact assessment on sepsis clinicals and survival, nomogram construction, immune infiltration analysis, molecular regulatory network, and molecular docking. In vitro experiments were conducted to establish a sepsis model in which THP-1 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to verify the differences in the expression of key genes. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of sepsis cells was analysed at the single-cell level. RESULTS: Three key genes (ID2, ZFP36L1, and ZNF148) were selected from among 11 candidate genes. ID2 had relatively strong functional similarity with the others. These genes were enriched in 9, 3, and 6 pathways, respectively, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and ribosome. Differences in ID2 expression were observed among the age subgroups. A difference in survival was observed between the high- and low-expression groups of the three genes in sepsis patients. The nomograms exhibited good predictive and clinical value. Four differentially expressed immune cell types were detected between the sepsis and control groups. The key genes showed potential regulatory relationships with multiple transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). For instance, bioinformatics analysis suggested that ID2 might be influenced by HOXA9, ZFP36L1 could be targeted by hsa-miR-27a-3p, and ZNF148 may be modulated by hsa-miR-365b-3p. Binding energies of -8.5 kcal/mol were observed between ZFP36L1 and amarogentin and andrographolide. In vitro experiments revealed significant variations in the expression levels of key genes-ID2, ZNF148, and ZFP36L1-in sepsis. These genes have potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis of this condition. Finally, neutrophils were identified as key cells, and the expression of key genes showed a dynamic distribution during their development. CONCLUSION: ID2, ZFP36L1, and ZNF148 may serve as potential candidate regulators of sepsis-associated butyrate metabolism, and the nomogram model showed preliminary predictive value for clinical assessment in sepsis patients. These findings provide exploratory insights that may aid in further investigations of the pathological mechanisms underlying sepsis. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

41220006,Protein acylation in inflammatory diseases: from mechanisms to therapeutic strategies.,2025,"Protein acylation, a critical subset of post-translational modifications (PTMs), serves as a dynamic regulatory mechanism linking cellular metabolism, epigenetic regulation, and inflammatory responses. This review systematically elucidates the roles of protein acylation modifications-including acetylation, lactylation, succinylation, propionylation, crotonylation, malonylation, butyrylation, S-palmitoylation, and myristoylation-in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. These modifications, orchestrated by acyltransferases (writers), deacylases (erasers), and recognition proteins (readers), regulate immune cell functionality and disease progression. In immune cells, specific acylation patterns govern inflammatory responses by modulating polarization, cytokine production, and signaling pathways. Furthermore, dysregulated protein acylation contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, periodontitis, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis through disrupting immune homeostasis, driving metabolic reprogramming, and impairing tissue repair. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting acylation-related enzymes or leveraging nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems show promise in restoring balanced PTM dynamics and alleviating disease progression. By systematically mapping protein acylation networks across immune and diseased cells, this review provides insights into novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for inflammatory diseases."
41219512,Alterations in Gut Microbiota and their Association with Colonic Permeability and Inflammation in LPS-induced Sepsis Mice.,2025,"Sepsis is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the gut microbiota and their mechanisms of action in a mouse model of sepsis. 20 mice were exposed to saline, while 70 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The diversity, structure, and composition of the gut microbiota were examined using 16S rRNA sequencing on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expressions of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin to assess intestinal barrier damage. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) to assess the degree of inflammation. Over time, mice exposed to LPS exhibited marked dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by changes in microbiota composition. This was primarily due to the colonization of pathogenic bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria, and a significant decrease in the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Additionally, the structure of the intestinal microbiota in LPS-treated mice was altered, resulting in a significant reduction in diversity. Bacteroides was identified as a biomarker through genus-level LEfSe analysis. The expressions of colonic occludin and ZO-1 were significantly downregulated, while the level of IL-17 was elevated in LPS-treated mice. The results of this study suggest that the gut microbiota undergoes changes during a week of sepsis in mice and that microbiota dysfunction may be closely related to intestinal barrier dysfunction and changes in the IL-17/IL-23 axis."
41218723,Calcitonin and procalcitonin: Revisiting the overlooked role of C cells.,2026,"Calcitonin (CT) is a hormone produced by C cells in the thyroid gland. Its primary function is to regulate bone turnover. However, it is believed to be of little importance to human physiology because its absence following thyroidectomy has no dramatic effects. It was used in the treatment of osteoporosis but has now largely been replaced by bisphosphonates and monoclonal antibodies. However, some studies suggest that CT may have additional functions, such as those related to bone structure, osteoprotection, and pain management. This review summarizes CT synthesis and function and discusses its role and that of its precursor, procalcitonin, as biomarkers. Procalcitonin detection has advantages over some established markers in sepsis management and due to its greater stability, it is also an alternative to CT for managing medullary thyroid carcinoma. Recent research has raised the possibility that procalcitonin could serve as a direct molecular target for treating sepsis. Potential roles of various regulatory peptides released by C cells that may contribute to paracrine fine-tuning of thyroid hormone secretion by follicular thyrocytes are considered. Health-care providers should inform patients that despite optimal thyroxine replacement therapy, subtle symptoms may still occur due to the absence of C cells."
41218493,"Integrating network toxicology, machine learning, and single-cell data to explore the mechanism of sepsis-related biomarkers associated with TCDD.",2025,"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection, has seen a rising incidence in recent years, partly attributed to environmental factors. Several studies have suggested that TCDD, a toxic environmental pollutant, may contribute to an elevated risk of sepsis. As a Class I human carcinogen, TCDD disrupts normal vascular and immune system functions-critical risk factors for sepsis onset. However, the key targets and underlying mechanisms by which TCDD influences sepsis remain unclear. Through network toxicology, transcriptomics, machine learning, and Mendelian randomization, the biomarkers PPARG and CASPASE-3 were identified, both of which are significantly associated with oxidative phosphorylation and other signaling pathways. These biomarkers also correlate with gammadeltaT cell infiltration in the immune response. Molecular docking studies confirm the stable interaction between TCDD, PPARG, and CASPASE-3, supporting their involvement in sepsis progression. A single-cell dataset was used to analyze the dynamic changes of key immune cells in sepsis pathogenesis, highlighting their connection to PPARG and CASPASE-3. The study conducted rigorous validation and in-depth analysis of the identified biomarkers by incorporating an external validation set and single-cell data, significantly strengthening the reliability of the results. This comprehensive approach offers valuable clues for identifying potential therapeutic targets for sepsis."
41217295,Prognostic utility of serial procalcitonin measurements in ICU sepsis: a laboratory-led modelling approach in a resource-limited setting procalcitonin modelling for sepsis mortality in a low-resource ICU.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Procalcitonin (PCT) is increasingly used to support sepsis diagnosis, but its role in predicting outcomes remains uncertain, particularly in low-resource settings. We evaluated whether single and serial PCT measurements were associated with 28-day mortality in critically ill adults with suspected sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with suspected sepsis and at least one PCT measurement at a tertiary hospital in South Africa (August 2022-July 2023). Baseline PCT was analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Among patients with >/=2 PCT values, we examined the association between PCT slope (from patient-level linear regression) and mortality. Latent class mixed models (LCMM) were used to identify PCT trajectory subgroups. RESULTS: Of 371 patients, 119 (32 %) died within 28 days. Higher baseline log-PCT was independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.58; 95 % CI 1.01-2.50). A rising PCT slope trended toward higher mortality (aOR 3.56 per unit/day; p=0.06). LCMM identified three trajectory classes with distinct mortality risks (class 2: aOR 4.53; class 3: aOR 4.35, vs. reference). These models were based entirely on laboratory data and did not assess clinical scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Both baseline and serial PCT measurements predicted mortality in ICU patients with suspected sepsis. Modelling approaches based on routine laboratory data may offer scalable tools for early risk stratification in resource-limited settings."
41217035,"A novel, standardised approach to balancing effectiveness, efficiency and utility of surveillance AI prediction models for hospitalised patients using sepsis prediction as an exemplar.",2026,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce a novel, standardised approach to evaluating AI prediction models in balancing effectiveness, efficiency and utility, using a sepsis prediction model case study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective patient data from electronic medical records of 7 public hospitals was used to retrain and evaluate a machine learning sepsis prediction model. Four conventional metrics-area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), sensitivity, positive predictive value, and specificity-were compared with a novel graphical display integrating metrics of predictive accuracy (effectiveness), alert burden (efficiency) and lead time of alerts relative to clinical events (utility) for different alert thresholds. RESULTS: The dataset comprised 977,506 inpatient admissions. The novel methodology produced a plot of four vertically aligned graphs that enables decision-makers to identify an alert threshold that optimally balances effectiveness, efficiency and utility (EEU) at the level of an entire admission, and which differs from that derived using conventional metrics. DISCUSSION: Conventional evaluation metrics do not consider alert timing relative to clinical events and are often applied to different evaluation datasets (sample and admission level), introducing bias and confusion. In contrast, the EEU methodology (i) generates admission level evaluations at different alert thresholds; (ii) measures alert timing relative to clinical events; and (iii) provides a visual display that enables identification of the alert threshold that optimally balances EEU factors. CONCLUSION: Evaluations of prediction models for adverse events in hospitalised patients should incorporate the EEU approach in assessing model suitability and selecting alert thresholds."
41216590,Future Management of Sepsis in Liver Cirrhosis.,2026,"Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, particularly those with underlying liver disease. The past decade has seen a paradigm shift in the understanding and management of sepsis, driven by refined definitions, improved risk stratification tools, and organ-specific therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the evolving landscape of sepsis pathophysiology, highlights emerging biomarkers, and integrates recent advances in artificial intelligence and precision medicine. We also provide a detailed discussion on organ-specific supportive strategies and potential future directions. Understanding these developments is critical for hepatologists and intensivists aiming to reduce sepsis-associated mortality."
41215611,CD4(+)CD28(+) T lymphocyte is associated with the 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a major health concern with high mortality, which is associated with immunosuppression. CD28, a co-stimulatory molecule on T lymphocytes, promotes T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production. CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells play an important role in immune activation and regulation. This study aimed to determine whether CD4(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes were associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 80 adult patients with sepsis admitted to the department of intensive care unit. Peripheral blood CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells were measured within 24 h of admission using flow cytometry. Independent predictors of 28-day mortality were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: In total, 80 patients with sepsis were included, of whom 15 (18.8%) died within 28 days. Most patients were older than 60 years (56/80, 70.0%) and male (52/80, 65.0%). The predominant sources of infection were the lung (47/80, 58.8%) and abdomen (28/80, 35.0%), with bacteria being the most common pathogens (68/80, 85.0%). Compared to non-survivors, survivors had lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, lower rates of septic shock and acute kidney injury (AKI), a higher proportion of CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells > 75.9%, and a lower proportion of CD8(+) CD28(+) T cells </=39.9%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis depicted that CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells (cutoff value was 75.9%) showed an area under the curve of 0.732, a sensitivity of 66.67%, and a specificity of 80.00%. The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly better survival in patients with CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells > 75.9% than in those with </=75.9%. In univariate Cox regression analysis, SOFA score >/=6, septic shock, AKI, CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells </=39.9%, and CD4(+)CD28(+) T cells </=75.9% were associated with 28-day morality in patients with sepsis. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that SOFA score >/=6, AKI, and CD4(+)CD28(+) T cell </=75.9% were independent risk factors for 28-day morality of sepsis patients. CONCLUSION: A low percentage of CD4(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes (</=75.9%) is an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis."
41214806,Unsupervised clustering based on a graph attention network reveals high-risk subgroups among ICU dementia patients for enhanced mortality prediction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Dementia presents a significant global health burden, with an increasing prevalence and considerable economic implications. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the number of dementia patients has steadily increased, highlighting the need for more accurate risk stratification. Traditional methods of patient classification often assume homogeneity, limiting their ability to identify subgroups at varying levels of mortality risk. This study explored the potential of graph attention networks (GATs) in addressing this gap, aiming to better characterize high-risk dementia subgroups in the ICU and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study utilized anonymized patient data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III datasets. Dementia patients were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, with exclusions based on specific admission criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 7904 patients. A comprehensive set of demographics, comorbidities, ICU severity scores, and laboratory parameters was selected. Three unsupervised clustering methods were employed: a graph autoencoder (GAE), a graph attention autoencoder (GAT), and K-means combined with UMAP-based dimensionality reduction. The optimal number of clusters (k = 3) was determined by maximizing the silhouette scores and Calinski-Harabasz indices. The GAT method quantitatively outperformed both the GAE and K-means methods, achieving superior cluster separation (MIMIC-IV: highest silhouette score: 0.090; Calinski-Harabasz: 345.501; Davies-Bouldin: 2.30; MIMIC-III: highest silhouette score: 0.210; Calinski-Harabasz: 380.620; Davies-Bouldin: 1.850). Three distinct subgroups were identified: Cluster 1 represented the highest-risk phenotype, characterized by advanced age, coagulopathy, anemia, and organ dysfunction, with a strikingly elevated mortality risk (HR = 21.58, p < 0.001). Compared with the unstratified cohort, the machine learning models trained on the MIMIC-IV and validated on the MIMIC-III cohort showed improved predictive performance (AUC up to 0.85 within clusters). SHAP analysis revealed cluster-specific drivers, including a prolonged length of stay, renal impairment, and inflammatory markers. Visualization of the subgroups was achieved via sunburst plots, radar charts, and boxplots. RESULTS: This study included 7904 patients, who were divided into two groups: the nonoccurrence group (n = 5,038) and the occurrence group (n = 2,866). Baseline characteristics, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors, significantly differed between the groups. Unsupervised clustering methods identified distinct patient subgroups, with the GAT algorithm outperforming K-means and GCN in clustering both cohorts. Cox regression revealed that the GAT identified high-risk groups, with mortality significantly higher in Cluster 1 (HR = 21.58, P < 0.001). Cluster analysis revealed that Cluster 1 had the highest mortality risk and was characterized by advanced age, severe renal dysfunction, and poor clinical outcomes. To validate the superiority of the GAT-based unsupervised clustering approach, we applied various machine learning algorithms, which demonstrated enhanced predictive performance across the identified subgroups. The feature distributions and interrelationships were visualized using radar plots, boxplots, and SHAP analysis. SHAP further revealed distinct risk profiles: Cluster 0 was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events and acute kidney injury; Cluster 1 reflected a high metabolic stress state indicative of early systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis; and Cluster 2 was primarily marked by severe renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of GAT-based clustering for identifying high-risk subgroups among dementia patients in the ICU. By providing more granular risk stratification, these models can support clinical decision-making and improve patient management. These findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing ICU care for dementia patients, with future research focusing on temporal validation and integration into clinical workflows to optimize outcomes."
41214769,Lactylation modulates immune infiltration in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multi-omics and machine learning study with experimental confirmation.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate lactylation-driven mechanisms in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Multi-cohort transcriptomic data sets (GSE10474, GSE32707, and GSE66890) were integrated with machine learning algorithms (LASSO, support vector machine, random forest) to identify differentially expressed lactylation-related genes (LRGs). Five hub genes (ALDH1A1, CALM1, CCNA2, HIST1H2BN, SH3GL1) were prioritized. Orthogonal experimental validation was performed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Subsequent analyses explored immune cell correlations (focusing on ALDH1A1), regulatory networks (transcription factors and miRNAs), and potential therapeutic drug candidates. RESULTS: Integration of bioinformatics analyses identified 25 differentially expressed LRGs and prioritized 5 hub genes. Experimental validation (qRT-PCR/Western blot) consistently demonstrated downregulation of all five hub gene proteins. Notably, this contradicted the bioinformatically predicted upregulation of CCNA2, HIST1H2BN, and SH3GL1, revealing a significant transcriptional-translational discordance. Further analysis revealed ALDH1A1-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cell and neutrophil correlations, a regulatory network comprising 68 transcription factors and 79 miRNAs, and 26 prioritized drug candidates. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a protein-verified lactylation-related gene signature with diagnostic relevance for sepsis-induced ARDS. Crucially, it highlights post-transcriptional regulation, evidenced by the discordance between mRNA levels and protein expression of key hub genes, as a key mechanistic feature in the pathogenesis of this condition. The identified regulatory networks and drug candidates provide potential avenues for further research and therapeutic development."
41213832,Advancing approaches to identify young children at risk for post-discharge mortality: Protocol for a prospective observational cohort study in Western Kenya.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Childhood mortality rates following hospital discharge may outpace inpatient mortality rates in some sub-Saharan African settings. Broadly validated risk assessment tools and biomarkers to identify children at risk for post-discharge mortality (PDM) are lacking. Moreover, clinical diagnoses (eg, pneumonia, sepsis, etc.) that confer high risk of PDM share a common pathobiology that culminates in endothelial dysfunction. The objectives of this study are to (1) externally validate existing risk assessment tools for PDM at 60 days and (2) test the association between a marker of endothelial dysfunction (ie, the global arginine bioavailability ratio [GABR]) and 60-day PDM among young children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, observational cohort study of neonates (aged 0-28 days, n=1000) and infants and children (aged 1-59 months, n=1000) consecutively discharged from two hospitals in Western Kenya (ie, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital [JOOTRH] and Siaya County Referral Hospital). Candidate variables for previously developed risk assessment tools identified through a systematic review and plasma samples will be collected on the day of hospital discharge. Caregivers of participants will receive telephone calls 30 days and 60 days following discharge to ascertain participants' vital status. Test characteristics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves will be calculated for each risk tool to determine their discriminatory value. Risk predictiveness and calibration of each tool will also be determined. Mean and median levels of GABR will be compared between cases and matched controls, and conditional logistic regression will be used to test the association between GABR and PDM. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has received clearance from the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific Ethics Review Unit, the JOOTRH Ethics Research Committee, and the Emory University institutional review board. Our results will be disseminated through scientific presentations at national and international conferences and peer-reviewed publications."
41212156,Serum heparin binding protein as a biomarker for sepsis in pyogenic liver abscess patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a severe infectious condition characterized by hepatic parenchymal pus accumulation, posing diagnostic and management challenges despite medical advances. Sepsis ensuing from PLA signifies a critical clinical scenario with notable morbidity and mortality implications. METHODS: A retrospective analysis encompassing 202 PLA patients over five years discerned 79 with sepsis (PLAS group) and 123 without sepsis (PLA group). Baseline characteristics, pathogen distribution, and serum heparin-binding protein (HBP) levels were assessed, alongside statistical analyses including multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in biliary tract disease prevalence, plasma procalcitonin (PCT), and blood lactate levels were noted between PLAS and PLA groups, suggesting potential sepsis indicators in PLA patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated among cultured pathogens, with no significant difference between septic and non-septic groups. Serum HBP levels were markedly elevated in PLAS patients, exhibiting positive correlations with sepsis severity and serving as an independent sepsis risk factor. ROC analysis demonstrated enhanced diagnostic performance for sepsis when combining serum HBP, PCT, and blood lactate levels. CONCLUSION: Serum HBP provides diagnostic and prognostic value for sepsis in PLA patients, and its combination with established biomarkers improves early detection and management."
41211916,Global longitudinal strain to early detect myocardial dysfunction in septic shock: a systematic review.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a common and reversible complication of septic shock that is often underdiagnosed due to the limitations of conventional echocardiography. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) derived from speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) may provide a more sensitive and load-independent marker of early myocardial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of GLS in patients with septic shock in the ICU. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guideline and published on PROSPERO (CRD420251034407). Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane) were searched without time or language restrictions (Sept-Oct 2024). Eligible studies included adults with sepsis or septic shock studied with GLS. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 24 studies, five studies were included (416 patients). GLS was significantly reduced in patients with septic shock, even with preserved LVEF. A GLS threshold between -13% and -15% predicted mortality and correlated with biomarkers (troponin I, NT-proBNP, lactate). Compared to LVEF, GLS showed higher sensitivity in detecting subclinical dysfunction and in monitoring myocardial recovery. GLS in a single view (apical four-chamber) was comparable to full-view assessment, suggesting feasibility at the bedside. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited number and observational nature of the available studies, GLS appears to be a promising tool for the early detection and monitoring of myocardial dysfunction in septic shock. Its integration into ICU practice could improve risk stratification and individualized treatment. Further multicenter studies are needed to standardize the cut-offs and confirm the clinical benefit."
41211659,Chest CT-derived body composition parameters for outcome prediction in sepsis patients with pneumonia.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the potential contribution of chest computed tomography (CT)-derived body composition parameters in predicting adverse events in sepsis patients with pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on sepsis with pneumonia cases who visited Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2023 to September 2024. We used chest CT scans to quantify skeletal muscle area (SMA) at the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4) and the first lumbar vertebra (L1) levels, as well as abdominal circumference (AC), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) at the L1 level. RESULTS: A total of 303 patients (203 men; median age 70 years, interquartile range 63-79) were included in the study. Fully adjusted models identified low SMA(T4), low SAT(L1), and high AC(L1) as independent risk factors for medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission, with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.795, 0.897, and 2.095, respectively. Low SMA(T4) (OR 0.880, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.800-0.967, p = 0.008) and high AC(L1) (OR 1.527, 95% CI 1.122-2.079, p = 0.007) were both independently associated with in-hospital mortality. High IMAT(L1) (beta: -2.360, p = 0.003) was associated with a greater decrease in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio during hospitalization. Models using chest CT-derived body composition parameters to predict MICU admission, septic shock, and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis were as effective as sequential organ failure assessment scores. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of frailty status and visceral obesity, determined by chest CT measurements of low thoracic muscle mass and elevated AC, is independently correlated with an increased risk of admission to the MICU and mortality among sepsis patients with pneumonia. This underscores the significance of CT-derived body composition as a critical imaging biomarker that reflects the physiological reserve of sepsis patients and their associated risk of adverse events."
41211644,Pancreatic Stone Protein levels reflect sepsis severity and bloodstream infections in critically ill children: a retrospective cohort analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) has been proposed as a sepsis biomarker, but its role in severity stratification in pediatric intensive care and its relation to infectious source have not been explored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 97 pediatric patients admitted to the PICU with new-onset sepsis (within 24h from diagnosis). Blood samples were collected within 24h to measure PSP levels and compared with microbiological culture results. RESULTS: Among 97 patients, PSP levels were significantly higher in those with positive blood cultures (n = 24; median 108 ng/mL) compared with negatives (n = 73; 82 ng/mL, p = 0.008). When combining blood molecular testing with cultures, PSP remained higher in positives (n = 31; 111 ng/mL) than negatives (n = 66; 85 ng/mL, p = 0.026). PSP levels also correlated with sepsis severity: Non-septic (n = 55, median 72 ng/mL), sepsis (n = 22, median 238 ng/mL), septic shock (n = 20, 375 ng/mL) (p = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that PSP had superior accuracy in predicting sepsis severity (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87) compared with C-reactive protein (C-RP, AUC 0.54, 95% 0.37-0.64) and procalcitonin (PCT, AUC 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: PSP is a promising biomarker for sepsis detection and severity prediction in critically ill pediatric patients. Further studies are required to validate its integration into diagnostic protocols."
41211027,Global Research Trends in Sepsis-Associated Coagulopathy: A Web of Science-Based Bibliometric Analysis (2000-2024).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a critical determinant of organ dysfunction and mortality in patients with sepsis. While research in this field is rapidly expanding, a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of its knowledge landscape is lacking. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis to delineate the global research status, identify thematic hotspots, and reveal emerging frontiers in the field of SIC from 2000 to 2024. METHODS: We retrieved publications related to SIC from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), with the final search conducted on May 27, 2025. Only original English-language 'Articles' were included. Bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping were performed using VOSviewer (v1.6.18) and CiteSpace (v6.2.R6) to analyze countries, authors, journals, co-cited references, and keywords. RESULTS: A total of 1715 publications were included. The annual publication volume showed an exponential growth trend, particularly after 2020. The United States was the leading country in publication output (471 articles, 27.5%), and Critical Care Medicine was the most productive journal (106 articles). The PROWESS trial published by Bernard GR et al (2001) was the most co-cited foundational document with 4,188 co-citations. Keyword analysis identified four major research clusters: (1) Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Endothelial Injury, (2) Diagnostic Biomarkers and Prognostic Assessment, (3) Anticoagulant Therapy and Clinical Management, and (4) Immunothrombosis and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, research on SIC has evolved from exploring fundamental coagulation pathways to investigating the intricate mechanisms of immunothrombosis. Current research hotspots focus on endothelial injury, NETs, and the development of precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This analysis provides a quantitative map of the knowledge structure and emerging trends in the SIC field, offering a valuable reference for future research priorities."
41210235,Machine learning-based time-to-event survival analysis in pediatric patients with severe sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critically ill children worldwide. Current approaches to sepsis prognosis rely on clinical criteria and biomarkers with variable performance. This study aimed to develop and validate time-to-event survival prediction models for pediatric sepsis using survival analysis machine learning algorithms. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 223 pediatric sepsis patients from a pediatric intensive care database (2010-2018). Five survival analysis machine learning algorithms were evaluated: CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis, HingeLossSurvivalSVM, GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis, RandomSurvivalForest, and ExtraSurvivalTrees. These algorithms predict survival time rather than binary outcomes. Model performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the curve (td-AUC), concordance index (c-index), Brier score, and calibration curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed for model interpretability, and zero-crossing point analysis identified clinically actionable thresholds. RESULTS: Among 223 patients, 200 (89.7%) survived with median ICU stay of 12.2 days for survivors vs. 2.3 days for non-survivors. RandomSurvivalForest achieved the highest performance with td-AUC of 0.97, while CoxPHSurvival and HingeLossSurvivalSVM showed comparable c-indices of 0.87. SHAP analysis identified calcium total and RDW as the strongest mortality predictors. Zero-crossing point analysis established clinical thresholds: calcium total <1.10 mmol/L, RDW >15.07%, sodium <131.68 mmol/L, and pH <7.32 were associated with increased mortality risk, with U-shaped relationships observed for creatinine and lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: RandomSurvivalForest demonstrated superior time-to-event prediction performance for pediatric sepsis. The survival analysis approach provides dynamic risk assessment and precise timing for clinical interventions. A web-based prediction calculator was developed to facilitate clinical implementation."
41209349,Metabolomics in neonatal sepsis: A critical appraisal of current evidence.,2025,"Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, timely and accurate diagnosis continues to present a significant clinical challenge. Current diagnostic methods, including blood culture and inflammatory markers, are limited by delayed turnaround times and a lack of specificity, often leading to overtreatment or missed opportunities for intervention. In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as a promising approach for discovering novel biomarkers that reflect the systemic metabolic disruptions characteristic of neonatal sepsis. This systematic review summarizes the existing evidence on changes in metabolites and metabolite classes associated with neonatal sepsis, with a focus on their potential as biomarkers. Eleven eligible studies were reviewed, covering various analytical techniques and biofluids, including serum, urine, and stool. Although a wide range of metabolite alterations was observed, particular attention was given to amino acid metabolism, energy substrates, and lipid derivatives. The findings emphasize both the potential and current limitations of metabolomics-based biomarker discovery in this area. The review identifies important gaps in the literature, including diverse study designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting, highlighting the need for rigorous, standardized research. The importance and clinical potential of metabolomics in neonatal sepsis are thoroughly discussed."
41209137,Sepsis-Related Cardiomyopathy: Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment.,2025,"Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) constitutes a critical myocardial impairment that substantially elevates mortality risk in septic patients. The structural and functional changes of SICM are accompanied by metabolic disturbances, including mitochondrial dysfunction and altered myocardial metabolism. Diagnostic advancements feature biomarkers, circulating microRNAs, and imaging tools, such as speckle-tracking echocardiography. Therapies extend from vasopressors to immunomodulators, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, and mesenchymal stem cell-based approaches. Despite progress, challenges related to heterogeneity and the need for long-term data persist. Thus, integrated approaches leveraging machine learning and omics are essential for optimizing personalized care and reducing the global burden of SICM."
41208955,Multi-omic analysis of PBMCs in sepsis reveals widespread cytotoxic dysfunction and an increased population of CD69 expressing naive CD4+ T cells.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally and the majority of those who survive have lasting health issues. A hallmark of sepsis is a deregulated inflammatory response to infection, with leukocytes playing a critical role. METHODS: This study utilised a targeted single-cell multi-omics approach to characterise peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and their transcriptomic profiles in an Irish cohort of people with (i) sepsis and (ii) bacteraemia without sepsis (defined as clinically significant positive blood culture without sepsis as assessed by the Clinical Microbiology service). RESULTS: Variable leukocyte distributions were identified, with decreased cytotoxic lymphocytes, including CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, CD56+ T cells, gammadelta T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, and increased T helper (Th) cell subsets within sepsis samples. Additionally, PBMCs from sepsis samples displayed an impaired expression profile in effector T cells, resulting in widespread suppression of PBMC cytotoxic activity. DISCUSSION: These results identify potential mechanisms underlying the functional impairment witnessed in sepsis. Such mechanisms may inform future diagnostic and treatment strategies."
41208642,Research Progress of Annexin A1 and Its Derived Peptides in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Circulatory Diseases.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, plays a critical role in regulating inflammation, apoptosis, immune responses, and vascular remodeling. It is increasingly recognized for its potential as a therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker in various circulatory diseases, including sepsis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disorders. ANXA1 and its derived peptides exert protective effects by modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in disease pathogenesis. AIM: This review summarizes the current research progress on ANXA1 and its derived peptides in the diagnosis and treatment of circulatory diseases, highlighting their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and other relevant databases. Articles published up to 2024 were included, with a focus on experimental studies, clinical reports, and reviews addressing the role of ANXA1 in circulatory diseases. Key themes included anti-inflammatory mechanisms, apoptosis regulation, immune modulation, and vascular protection. RESULT: ANXA1 and its mimetic peptides like Ac2-26, ANXA1sp, RTP-026 and so on demonstrate significant protective effects across multiple circulatory diseases. They attenuate inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, while promoting mitochondrial biosynthesis and immune regulation. These effects are mediated through receptors such as FPR2/ALX and pathways involving SIRT3, PI3K/Akt, and AMPK/mTOR. However, the role of ANXA1 can be context-dependent, exhibiting both protective and detrimental effects in specific conditions such as gestational hypertension and transient ischemic attack. CONCLUSION: ANXA1 represents a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for circulatory diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate its complex regulatory networks and validate its clinical applicability through multi-omics approaches and large-scale trials."
41207616,Metabolomic biomarkers enhance prediction of feeding intolerance in ICU septic patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of enteral feeding intolerance (ENFI) in septic patients remains challenging, as existing clinical tools show limited predictive value. METHODS: A prospectively cohort of 60 patients with sepsis (30 ENFI, 30 with feeding tolerance) and 20 healthy controls was enrolled. Serum samples were drawn for metabolomic profiling on the 1st day following sepsis. LC/MS was used to profile serum metabolites. The feeding intolerance outcome was collected at 14 days after ICU admission. Using a deep learning algorithm, we developed three ENFI prediction models: a metabolite-based model, a clinical risk model, and a new combined model integrating both feature types. RESULTS: The metabolite-based model included four key biomarkers-palmitic acid, histidine-threonine, glutamate-histidine, and dehydrobilirubin-and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. The clinical model, based on variables such as APACHE II score, intra-abdominal pressure, and albumin, achieved an AUC of 0.88. The combined model demonstrated the best performance, with an AUC of 0.94. It also showed higher accuracy, precision, F1-score, and net benefit in decision curve analysis, particularly when the risk threshold exceeded 4%. Statistical comparisons confirmed its superiority (Net Reclassification Index = 0.33, Integrated Discrimination Improvement = 0.31, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating metabolomics with clinical data significantly improves ENFI risk prediction in septic patients. External validation is warranted before clinical application."
41206374,Effects of Xuebijing combined with levosimendan on immune function and coagulation function in sepsis patients with myocardial injury.,2025,"We aimed to investigate the effects of Xuebijing (XBJ) combined with levosimendan on the immune function and coagulation function in patients with sepsis complicated by myocardial injury. This double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 88 sepsis patients with myocardial injury, split into control (n = 44, levosimendan plus conventional therapy) and combination (n = 44, control group's treatment plus XBJ injection) groups. Primary outcomes: coagulation parameters [prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet count (PLT), fibrinogen (Fib), and D-dimer (D-D)], immune function indicators (peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets: CD4+, CD8+, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio). Secondary outcomes: inflammatory markers [procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha)], vascular endothelial function markers [endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM)], myocardial function biomarkers [cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), and B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)], and hemodynamic parameter [heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP)]. Post-treatment, serum levels of PCT, CRP, TNF-alpha, ET-1, vWF, sTM, PT, APTT, D-D, CD8+, cTnI, CK-MB, BNP, and HR were lower in both groups, with further reductions in the combination group. Levels of NO, VEGF, PLT, Fib, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, MAP and CVP were higher in the combination group than in the control group (all P < 0.05). The combination of XBJ and levosimendan improves coagulation function, regulates immune function, enhances vascular endothelial function and hemodynamics, reduces inflammation, and alleviates myocardial injury."
41204568,Monocyte count predicts low-level viremia in people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"Low-level viremia (LLV) remains a clinical challenge in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), with its pathogenesis and predictors not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests a role for monocytes in HIV persistence and immune activation. However, the clinical significance of monocyte count (MONO) as a predictive biomarker for LLV has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate whether baseline (MONO) is associated with the risk of developing LLV in PLWH. We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 671 PLWH on ART at Ningbo Yinzhou No. 2 Hospital. Participants were categorized into tertiles based on baseline MONO. The primary outcome was the incidence of LLV. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the association between MONO and LLV, adjusting for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses were conducted stratified by baseline HIV viral load and ART regimen. In addition, MONO trajectories were analyzed using linear mixed models. During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the incidence of LLV was 14.2% (56.9 cases per 1000 person-years). Higher baseline MONO was independently associated with an increased risk of LLV (HR = 3.708, 95% CI: 1.918-7.169 for middle vs low tertile; HR = 4.695, 95% CI: 2.491-8.849 for high vs low tertile; both P < .001), regardless of baseline viral load or ART regimen. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings across different subgroups. LLV was associated with persistently elevated MONO. Monocyte count is an independent risk factor for the development of LLV in PLWH receiving ART. These findings provide preliminary evidence that MONO may serve as a readily accessible biomarker for identifying individuals at increased risk."
41204545,Association between red cell distribution width to albumin ratio and 28‑day mortality in older patients with sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is a novel biomarker and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with sepsis has not been extensively investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between RAR and prognosis in older patients with sepsis. We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing the eICU Collaborative Research Database to examine the relationship between the RAR and patient outcomes in sepsis cases. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 28 days of intensive care unit admission. To explore this association, we employed multivariate regression analysis and conducted subgroup analyses. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to assess prognostic value and survival differences, respectively. The study included 17,321 eligible patients. It was observed that the median of RAR was notably higher in patients who did not survive compared to those who did at the 28-day mark. Participants were categorized into 3 groups based on their RAR values, revealing a significantly increased risk of 28-day mortality in the group with elevated RAR. The association between RAR and 28-day mortality risk appeared potentially nonlinear. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that those in the higher RAR group experienced increased 28-day mortality. Our study shows that RAR is significantly associated with poor clinical prognosis in sepsis. The higher RAR is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in older patients with sepsis."
41204362,Recent advances in biomarkers for detection and diagnosis of sepsis and organ dysfunction: a comprehensive review.,2025,"Sepsis is life-threatening inflammatory disease, and its pathogenesis and prognostic factors remain unclear. In addition, the symptoms and signs of sepsis patients lack specificity, which makes the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation of sepsis extremely difficult. Recently, with the emergence and development of detection technologies, various sepsis-related biomarkers have emerged. Biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. Therefore, searching for reliable biomarkers and evaluating their role in sepsis is envisaged to aid clinical decision-making. This article reviews the advances in research on sepsis biomarkers and their application in the early prediction of organ dysfunction to improve our understanding of current sepsis biomarkers and provide a reference for the application of biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of sepsis. Besides, we propose that the combining multiple biomarkers is expected to be a more accurate and comprehensive strategy to evaluate the condition and prognosis of sepsis patients."
41199616,The utility of base excess in neonatal sepsis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific clinical presentation and limitations of current diagnostic approaches. Base excess (BE), derived from routine blood gas analysis, has emerged as a potential rapid biomarker reflecting metabolic disturbances associated with sepsis. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of BE in neonatal sepsis.Methods: A literature search was conducted across PubMed/MedLine, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EBSCOHost, and gray literature repositories from inception to July 2025. We included studies reporting BE measurement in neonatal sepsis. Two-by-two data were pooled using bivariate random-effects models to estimate sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Mortality risk was assessed using odds ratios. This study followed the PRISMA guideline, and evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE methodology. The protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42024601108).Results: Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. BE threshold </=-5 mEq/L from arterial/capillary blood demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 85.8% (95% CI: 59.9%-96.1%), a specificity of 82.9% (95% CI: 46.2%-96.5%), and an AUC of 0.909. Cord blood BE </= -10 mEq/L showed high specificity (96.7%, 95% CI: 91.5%-98.8%) but low sensitivity (10.3%, 95% CI: 6.5%-15.7%). Decreased BE levels were associated with increased mortality risk (OR 3.14; 95% CI: 1.34-7.36). The certainty of evidence was low.Conclusion: BE shows potential as a biomarker for neonatal sepsis. However, the low-certainty evidence underscores the need for further prospective validation and exploration of BE's role within combined biomarker algorithms before widespread clinical implementation."
41198560,"Metabolomics Profiling of Kidney, Spleen, Lung, and Liver Tissues in a Mouse Model of Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, often leading to multiorgan dysfunction. Despite their clinical importance, early diagnostic biomarkers that reflect organ-specific damage remain inadequately characterized. METHODS: Targeted metabolomic profiling of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, nucleosides, and kynurenine pathway metabolites was performed on lung, kidney, spleen, and liver tissues obtained from a lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse model of sepsis, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses (principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis) were performed to identify potential biomarkers, followed by pathway analysis to elucidate their biological relevance. RESULTS: Twenty-nine metabolites were significantly altered across the four tissues, exhibiting organ-specific metabolic signatures. Tyrosine, epinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and kynurenic acid in the kidney; serine, 4-hydroxyproline, normetanephrine, xanthosine, uridine, adenosine, succinic acid, cis-aconitic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosadienoic acid in the spleen; alanine, alpha-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, uridine, adenosine, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine, succinic acid, and cis-aconitic acid in the lung; and alpha-aminobutyric acid, pipecolic acid, uridine, inosine, adenosine, glycolic acid, and oxaloacetic acid in the liver were identified as potential biomarkers reflecting organ-specific dysfunction in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the distinct organ-specific metabolic alterations in sepsis and identifies candidate biomarkers that may reflect early organ dysfunction. These findings provide a foundation for the development of precise diagnostic and medical strategies for sepsis."
41197775,Phosphate-to-Albumin Ratio: A novel nutritional and prognostic marker in critically ill patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Both albumin and phosphate are important biomarkers, with albumin reflecting nutritional status and inflammation, while phosphate plays a vital role in cellular metabolism and signaling. The phosphate-to-albumin ratio (PAR) integrates these two parameters, potentially serving as a composite marker linking nutritional and metabolic dysfunction in sepsis. This study examines the association between PAR and 28-day mortality in Vietnamese septic patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients with sepsis or septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in Vietnam. Serum phosphate and albumin level were collected within the first 24 h of diagnosis to calculate PAR. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 333 septic patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 67.7 +/- 17.6 years, and 62.8 % were male. The median PAR was significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (5.42 vs. 3.85, p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for PAR in predicting mortality was 0.66 (95 % CI: 0.60-0.72, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PAR remained an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (OR: 1.114, 95 % CI: 1.021-1.215, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The phosphate-to-albumin ratio is an accessible, novel biomarker that reflects both nutritional and metabolic disturbances in septic patients and independently predicts 28-day mortality. Further research is needed to validate this finding."
41196905,Effects of Vitamin E on Redox balance in regulating thiol/disulfide homeostasis in sepsis: An antioxidant therapy perspective.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening condition resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, is associated with high mortality and remains a major global health burden. Sepsis is characterized by an imbalance between oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to disruption of thiol-disulfide homeostasis, hematological abnormalities, cytokine dysregulation, and widespread tissue injury. METHODS: An experimental sepsis model was established in thirty-two male Balb-C mice using lipopolysaccharide administration. Animals were randomized into four groups: control, vitamin E, sepsis, and sepsis plus vitamin E. Serum oxidative stress markers, thiol-disulfide parameters, and inflammatory mediators, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-40, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were measured. Hematological indices of systemic inflammation were evaluated (Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio), and lung, liver, and kidney tissues were examined histologically using a semi-quantitative scoring system. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis caused marked disruption of thiol-disulfide balance, characterized by reduced native and total thiol levels, elevated disulfide levels, increased cytokine release, and severe histopathological injury. Vitamin E supplementation restored thiol-disulfide homeostasis, decreased oxidative stress, and attenuated systemic inflammation. In the sepsis plus vitamin E group, serum thiol levels increased significantly, while disulfide levels declined. Interleukin-40 showed a 24.2% reduction and tumor necrosis factor-alpha a 9.8% reduction compared with untreated septic animals. Histopathological analyses confirmed reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular congestion, and tissue degeneration, particularly in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E demonstrated significant protective effects against sepsis-induced oxidative and inflammatory injury by preserving thiol-disulfide homeostasis and reducing cytokine production. The more pronounced effect on interleukin-40 compared with tumor necrosis factor-alpha suggests selective modulation of inflammatory pathways and highlights interleukin-40 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings support vitamin E as a promising adjunctive therapy in sepsis, although further studies are required to define optimal dosing strategies and assess clinical applicability."
41195755,Glycocalyx and Endothelial Biomarkers as Prognostic Indicators in Sepsis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction, marked by degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and activation of endothelial cells, plays a pivotal role in the progression to organ failure and mortality. Biomarkers reflecting glycocalyx damage have demonstrated prognostic potential; however, their associations with clinical outcomes remain variable. We systematically evaluated the prognostic utility of glycocalyx-associated biomarkers (syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, hyaluronate) and the endothelial activation marker endocan in sepsis with respect to mortality, organ dysfunction, and inter-study heterogeneity. We included 23 studies through May 2025 encompassing 4529 patients with sepsis. Two independent reviewers extracted data using standardized protocols, including biomarker concentrations and clinical outcomes such as mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and respiratory failure. Risk of bias was assessed using the NOS, with 75% of studies rated as low risk. Elevated syndecan-1 was significantly associated with increased mortality (nine studies, n = 2167; OR 2.04, 95% CI, 1.66-2.51; p < 0.05; I(2) = 84%). Similarly, elevated endocan predicted mortality with a stronger effect size (six studies, n = 435; OR 5.06, 95% CI, 2.52-10.18; p < 0.05) and low heterogeneity. In contrast, syndecan-1 levels were not significantly associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (OR 2.35, 95% CI, 0.93-5.94; I(2) = 94%) or respiratory failure (OR 1.05, 95% CI, 0.27-4.02; I(2) = 91%). The majority of studies were ICU-based (78.3%), primarily adult cohorts (91.3%), with syndecan-1 the most commonly assessed biomarker (65.2%). Syndecan-1 and endocan serve as prognostic biomarkers for mortality in sepsis, with endocan demonstrating greater inter-study consistency."
41195684,Integrating clinical guidelines with large language models for improved sepsis mortality prediction.,2025,"We develop and validate a clinical guideline-integrated LLM for enhanced sepsis mortality prediction. Using MIMIC-IV data from 24,237 ICU sepsis patients, we fine-tuned a large language model with Low-Rank Adaptation, embedding clinical guidelines into the training process. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Ablation studies assessed the specific contributions of clinical guideline integration. The guideline-enhanced fine-tuned LLM demonstrated moderately higher performance across all evaluation metrics including predictive accuracy (0.819), F1-score (0.815), sensitivity (0.815), specificity (0.822), and AUC (0.852) in predicting mortality risk for septic patients compared to traditional machine learning (highest accuracy: 0.774, AUC: 0.850) and deep learning methods (highest accuracy: 0.762, AUC: 0.841). Ablation experiments demonstrated that explicit integration of clinical guideline knowledge substantially improved performance over both direct prompting (accuracy: 0.709, AUC: 0.706) and fine-tuning without clinical guidelines (accuracy: 0.786, AUC: 0.801). These findings demonstrate that incorporating clinical guidelines into the fine-tuning of large language models outperforms both traditional and deep learning baselines across multiple metrics in sepsis mortality prediction, highlighting the value of explicit domain knowledge integration for clinical AI's robustness."
41195174,Machine learning-based nomogram for mortality risk stratification in cirrhotic patients with sepsis: a single-center predictive model.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a nomogram-based predictive model for in-hospital mortality among patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by sepsis, and to evaluate its predictive accuracy. METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively collected from patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and sepsis who were admitted to the Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College of Anhui Medical University between January 2018 and July 2025. Patients were classified into the Survivor group or the Non-survivor group. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). Potential predictors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and a predictive model was subsequently developed using Lasso regression. The model was visualized as a nomogram, and its performance was rigorously evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess its clinical utility. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were enrolled in this study. Among the 188 patients in the training set, 54 (28.7%) died during hospitalization, while 21 out of 76 patients (27.6%) in the validation set experienced in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified alcoholic cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, mechanical ventilation, TBiL and HR as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (all P < 0.05). The nomogram model demonstrated robust predictive performance, with ROC analysis showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75-0.81) in the training set and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) in the validation set. Calibration plots revealed that the model's predictions closely aligned with the ideal reference line. DCA showed that the model provided significant clinical net benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities. CONCLUSION: The nomogram model developed using Lasso regression appears to demonstrate promising predictive potential for in-hospital mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by sepsis. This tool may offer valuable support for clinical decision-making and could potentially aid in guiding early interventions for patients identified as higher risk."
41194045,Development and validation of machine learning models to predict in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with sepsis and chronic kidney disease.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality in this high-risk population remains a clinical challenge. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to predict in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with sepsis and CKD. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with both sepsis and CKD were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm. Multiple ML models were developed, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), along with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for comparison. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and average precision (AP). The best-performing model was externally validated in an independent cohort from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and further interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: A total of 4,686 ICU patients with sepsis and CKD were included in the development cohort. Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.911, AP of 0.771, specificity of 96%, and sensitivity of 62%. In the external validation cohort of 3,718 patients, XGBoost also achieved excellent predictive performance with an AUC of 0.855. Model calibration and decision curve analysis confirmed its clinical utility. The top 20 predictors were visualized and ranked based on SHAP values. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, can accurately predict in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with sepsis and CKD. These models may assist clinicians in risk stratification and decision-making for this vulnerable patient population.

41194044,FPR1-dependent Pro-inflammatory Ccl4(high) monocytes/macrophages drive and predict sepsis-induced acute lung injury.,2025,"The elusive pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) combined with the absence of reliable diagnostic biomarkers, significantly hinders the development of targeted therapies and precision medicine approaches for affected patients. In this study, we employed scRNA-seq to profile the transcriptional landscape of the lungs in well-established murine models of sepsis-induced ALI. These findings were further validated experimentally leading to the identification of tri-lineage candidate biomarkers for sepsis-associated ALI: SCGB3A2 (in epithelial cells), AKAP12 (in endothelial cells), and CCL4 (in monocytes/macrophages, Mo/Mphi). In pulmonary immune microenvironment of sepsis-induced ALI, Mo/Mphi were identified as the dominant contributors to pulmonary immune heterogeneity during the acute inflammatory phase of sepsis-induced ALI. Among these, the Ccl4(high) Mo/Mphi subpopulation exhibited disease-specific lung infiltration and a distinct proinflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, FPR1 was up-regulated in hyperinflammatory cluster of Ccl4(high) Mo/Mphi. Pharmacological inhibition of FPR1 in vivo selectively reduced pulmonary infiltration of Ccl4(high) Mo/Mphi and attenuated sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, we established a peripheral blood-based five-gene panel (CCL4, NFKBIA, IL1B, BATF, and XBP1) derived from signatures of Ccl4(high) Mo/Mphi, which robustly predicted sepsis-induced ALI in clinical cohorts. Collectively, our work delineates the transcriptional alterations of lungs in sepsis-induced ALI, identifies candidate biomarkers for sepsis-induced ALI, and establishes a clinically applicable diagnostic model for early detection. These findings enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of sepsis-induced ALI and offer new targets for its precision diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.

41193561,Circulating endotoxin is correlated with fatty acid binding protein 2 and leukocyte nuclear factor-kappaB activation in menopausal women.,2025,"Circulating endotoxin is mainly derived from gut microbiome and is frequently increased after meals. However, the interplay between endotoxemia and innate immune cells in systemic inflammation remains unclear. The aim was to investigate the role of endotoxemia in systemic inflammation, focusing on the immune responses in innate immune cells. Menopausal women (n = 174) were divided into 2 groups. Blood samples were collected from the participants of group 1 (n = 80), who fasted for at least 8 h, to analyze the correlation between endotoxin levels, fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), markers of systemic inflammation, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in leukocytes. The participants of group 2 (n = 94) fasted for at least 8 h and received oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Their fasting and post-OGTT blood samples were also collected to evaluate the impact of postprandial endotoxemia on the expression of NF-kappaB target genes in leucocytes. The study revealed that circulating endotoxin level was significantly associated with FABP2 level and NF-kappaB activation in leukocytes after fasting and within a 2 h-OGTT period. Variation in endotoxin levels (about 1 EU/ml) was sufficient to modulate NF-kappaB activation in leukocytes. These results provide clues for understanding the effects of postprandial endotoxemia on immune cell activation and inflammation induction. Our findings suggest that an increase in intestinal barrier permeability might be linked to endotoxemia-induced systemic inflammation in menopausal women."
41192742,Early lactate trajectories predict mortality in sepsis-associated acute lung injury: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (SALI) is a life-threatening respiratory condition with high mortality. Serum lactate is a key marker of oxygen metabolism and tissue hypoperfusion. This study aimed to investigate whether dynamic lactate trajectories in the early ICU period could predict 28-day mortality in SALI patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 340 patients with SALI from the MIMIC-IV database. Lactate trajectories over the first three ICU days were identified using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM). Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate the association between trajectory classes and 28-day mortality. The prognostic performance of SOFA score alone and in combination with lactate trajectory was compared using ROC curves. RESULTS: Three distinct lactate trajectory classes were identified: persistently elevated, low and stable, and initially elevated then declining. Patients in the low-stable and moderate-declining groups had significantly lower mortality risks compared to those with persistently high lactate. Adding lactate trajectory to SOFA improved AUC from 0.629 to 0.693 (P = 0.0074). CONCLUSION: Early lactate trajectory classification is an independent predictor of mortality in SALI patients and enhances prognostic performance beyond SOFA. Incorporating trajectory-based risk stratification may inform more personalized respiratory management strategies."
41192111,Identification and clinical assessment of novel biomarkers for sepsis-induced liver injury.,2026,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sepsis is marked by a dysregulated response to infection, causing circulatory dysfunction, organ failure, and high mortality. Liver dysfunction serves as an early indicator of sepsis severity. However, current interventions remain limited. This study aims to use LC-MS/MS to identify differential proteins, and preliminarily validate them as potential biomarkers for sepsis-induced liver injury (SILI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established SILI mouse models using Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection. And then ELISA, Western blot, and H&E staining were performed to analyze liver pathology and function. Through LC-MS/MS, we explored key proteins and their functional and biological characteristics. Next, we evaluated key proteins' performance in the validation cohort using ROC and external validation from external datasets (GSE60088, PRJEB20791, PXD037868, CNP0002611, PXD027485). Finally, CCK-8 and RT-PCR assays were performed on the LPS-induced in vitro SILI model. RESULTS: A total of 113 shared differential proteins were identified in the CLP model and LPS model. GO, KEGG and WikiPathways analysis highlighted their association with inflammation, protein cascade activation, and lipid metabolism. Among these, TRAF-interacting protein with Forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) were selected for their central roles in inflammation and documented involvement in liver diseases. Plasma TIFA and S100A9 levels were significantly elevated in SILI patients compared to healthy control (HC), with consistent results in external datasets. S100A9, but not TIFA, was also higher in SILI than in disease control (DC). ROC analysis showed that both markers distinguished SILI from HCs, and the combination of TIFA, S100A9 and PCT effectively differentiated SILI from DCs, with their expression positively correlated with liver dysfunction. RT-PCR analysis further showed the transcription levels of TIFA and S100A9 upregulated in the cell model. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate TIFA and S100A9 as potential biomarkers for SILI. And, we establish the combination of TIFA, S100A9 and PCT as a novel diagnostic model with high sensitivity and specificity, providing new insights into the SILI diagnosis."
41190763,Association Between Hemoglobin Glycation Index and Delirium Risk in Sepsis Patients in the Intensive Care Unit.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a prevalent complication in the sepsis population, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The relationship between the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) and delirium in sepsis patients in the ICU is not yet clearly established. AIMS: To investigate the relationship between HGI and delirium risk in sepsis patients admitted to the ICU. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 3.1 for the sepsis population in the ICU. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence in the ICU, whereas the secondary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality (ACM) after ICU admission. The patients were stratified into tertiles according to HGI levels: T1 (HGI < -0.612), T2 (-0.612 </= HGI < 0.008), and T3 (HGI >/= 0.008). The link of HGI to clinical outcomes in ICU patients was examined through logistic regression (LR), Cox proportional hazard models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) and threshold effect analyses. The robustness of our findings was rated through subgroup analyses and interaction tests. RESULTS: In total, 3,744 patients were encompassed in the final analysis. The LR model showed that delirium risk in the T1 group was 67.7% higher than that in the T2 group [odds ratio (OR) = 1.677, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.414, 1.992], while that in the T3 group was 24.8% higher than that in the T2 group (OR = 1.248, 95% CI: 1.048, 1.487). The Cox proportional hazard model indicated a 36.2% higher risk of 30-day ACM in T1 compared to T2 (hazard ratio = 1.362; 95% CI: 1.041-1.782). The RCS curve demonstrated an approximately U-shaped relation of HGI to delirium risk. The threshold effect analysis revealed an inflection point at HGI = -0.34. When HGI </= -0.34, each one-unit increase in HGI lowered the delirium risk by 36.2% (95% CI: 0.527-0.768). CONCLUSION: This study suggested an independent association between HGI and both delirium risk and short-term prognosis in particularly in patients admitted to the ICU. HGI may be used as a prognostic risk stratification biomarker."
41190599,Evaluation of model performance in predicting sepsis after intestinal obstruction surgery: a multicenter retrospective study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Intestinal obstruction surgery is a high-risk procedure associated with postoperative sepsis. In this multicenter retrospective study, we aimed to employ machine-learning methods to predict sepsis after intestinal obstruction surgery and visualize its driving mechanism to assist clinical decision-making. METHODS: The study included patients who underwent surgery for intestinal obstruction at three medical centers between 2013 and 2021, as well as patients with intestinal obstruction from the publicly available perioperative dataset INSPIRE. Various algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector classification (SVC), the Gaussian Bayesian classifier, gradient boosting machine, random forest, adaptive boosting, and multilayer perceptron, were tested. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values were utilized for model interpretation. RESULTS: Postoperative sepsis was observed in 60 patients (16.17%), 10 patients (20%), and 10 patients (15.15%) in three medical centers, as well as 7 patients (12.73%) in INSPIRE dataset. In the internal validation set, the SVC algorithm demonstrated favorable performance, with an AUC value of 0.876 (95%CI 0.799-0.939). The model was well-calibrated, with a Brier score of 0.108 and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p = 0.183). The SHAP analysis identified six influential features in the model: age, POSSUM physiology score, ASA classification, shock index at the end of surgery, intraoperative total volume of infusion, and intraoperative dose of furosemide. External validation sets showed AUC values of 0.873, 0.896, 0.926, and 0.879, respectively. CONCLUSION: We have developed a highly interoperable sepsis risk calculator based on the SVC model to assist postoperative clinical decision-making in patients with intestinal obstruction."
41190512,Diagnostic Accuracy of Procalcitonin in the Diagnosis of Sepsis in Cancer Patients Hospitalized for Infection.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening, dysfunctional body-response to infection. Procalcitonin (PCT) is considered a marker of sepsis due to bacterial infections and it has been extensively used as a guide to antimicrobial management in the general population. The clinical role of PCT in cancer patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) for infection is still little researched. METHODS: A prospective observational study enrolling all adult patients hospitalized for infection referred to the ED of IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna between February 1st, 2023 and July 31st, 2023 was conducted. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the accuracy of PCT in the diagnosis of sepsis (defined according to the latest guidelines) in patients with cancer in comparison to non-cancer patients. RESULTS: 1041 out of 1125 eligible patients were enrolled (559 males and 482 females), out of whom 289 (27.8%) had active cancer. PCT levels differed between cancer and non-cancer patients (1 ng/mL with IQR 5.85 vs. 0.6 ng/mL with IQR 2.7; p < 0.001). The AUROC of PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis in the entire enrolled population was 0.717 (95% CI 0.683-0.745), whereas it was 0.655 (95% CI 0.592-0.718) in cancer patients and 0.743 (95% CI 0.708-0.778) in non-cancer patients (p = 0.016). A PCT cut-off of 0.5 ng/mL (PCT >/= 0.5 ng/mL) confirmed its accuracy for predicting sepsis in non-cancer patients (sensitivity 71.5%, specificity 64.1%) but the specificity fell to 44.7% in cancer patients, although sensitivity remained good (sensitivity 78.9%). Conversely, a higher PCT cut-off of 1 ng/mL, as the most accurate threshold identified in the present study in the cancer population, showed a sensitivity of 66.9% and specificity of 61.2% in predicting sepsis in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the clinical role of PCT as a part of the diagnostic algorithm for sepsis but its diagnostic role is sub optimal in cancer patients."
41190079,Integrated immunodominant epitope discovery for dual-purpose rapid and economical diagnostic and immunoprotective applications against MRSA.,2025,"Current diagnostic and preventive strategies against Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) remain inadequate. Hence, we aimed to identify candidate epitopes as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. We focused on clinically validated targets and investigated four antigens (Hla, SEB, MntC, and IsdB) currently incorporated into phase III clinical trials of a recombinant five-antigen vaccine (termed rFSAV) and the recently identified leukocidin LukG. Using convalescent serum samples from patients with clinically confirmed MRSA, we identified 10 immunodominant epitopes through ELISA screening of overlapping 18-mer peptides, seven of which named MntC(55-72), MntC(121-138), MntC(271-285), SEB(37-54), LukG(30-47), LukG(235-252), and LukG(246-263) have not been previously reported. Immunoprotection trials showed that five epitopes Hla(168-185), IsdB(384-401), MntC(55-72), SEB(37-54), and LukG(235-252) elicited effective protection in a BALB/c murine sepsis model infected with MRSA252. The combination of these protective epitopes exhibited broad-spectrum efficacy against both the MRSA252 strain and phylogenetically distinct clinical isolates. Diagnostically, the performance of the epitope panel was superior to that of conventional culture methods with a sensitivity of 0.839 and specificity of 0.826 in a 3-h detection window, thus offering rapid and cost-effective advantages. Notably, bioinformatic analysis showed that all identified B-cell epitopes contained predicted CD4(+) T-cell epitope sequences, which suggests the potential to elicit combined T-B cell immune responses through MHC-II presentation. Thus, these immunodominant epitopes with dual functions that integrate both diagnostic and immunoprotective capabilities could function as a novel immunodiagnostic toolkit that enables rapid MRSA detection and aid in establishing a multi-epitope vaccine platform. These findings present an integrated strategy that bridges diagnostic development and vaccine design for MRSA management."
41189212,"Inflammatory pathways and immune dysregulation in pediatric postoperative septic shock: A study integrating transcriptomics, machine learning and molecular docking.",2025,"This study elucidates the molecular and immune regulatory mechanisms of pediatric postoperative septic shock. Transcriptomic data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the limma package, and gene co-expression modules were constructed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. Functional enrichment was performed via gene set enrichment analysis, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT. Mendelian randomization was applied to explore causal relationships between gene expression and septic shock. Feature genes were selected using machine learning algorithms, and a diagnostic nomogram model was constructed. Finally, molecular docking analysis was performed to screen and evaluate the binding affinity of traditional Chinese medicine monomers to core target proteins. A total of 1331 differentially expressed genes were identified, and the turquoise module was strongly correlated with septic shock. Enrichment analysis revealed significant activation of IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Immune infiltration analysis indicated suppressed immune scores and imbalances in neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Mendelian randomization confirmed causal associations for 6 genes, including PIM3. The predictive model based on feature genes demonstrated high diagnostic performance. Molecular docking suggested that quercetin and astramembrannin I could stably bind PIM3. This study systematically identified core genes, dysregulated immune pathways, and candidate small-molecule interventions in pediatric septic shock, providing novel insights for early diagnosis and targeted therapy."
41189164,Prognostic value of admission serum magnesium and systemic inflammation indices in septic ICU patients aged 85 years and older: A retrospective observational study.,2025,"This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of admission serum magnesium levels and systemic inflammatory indices, including C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and multiple inflammation index, for predicting key clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with sepsis aged >/= 85 years. This retrospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of admission serum magnesium and systemic inflammatory indices in critically ill patients with sepsis aged >/= 85 years. Patients were stratified by serum magnesium levels into hypomagnesemia (<1.8 mg/dL), normomagnesemia (1.8-2.4 mg/dL), and hypermagnesemia (>2.4 mg/d). The prognostic performance for intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, 28-day mortality, mechanical ventilation requirement, and prolonged ICU stay was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Among 381 patients aged >/= 85 years (mean age 89.2 +/- 3.2; 59.3% male) admitted to the ICU with sepsis, the ICU and 28-day mortality rates were 33.1% and 37.8%, respectively. Hypermagnesemia (>2.4 mg/dL) was observed in 18.9% of patients and was associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment (sequential organ failure assessment) scores (9.2 +/- 3.1), CRP (129.7 +/- 84.6 mg/L), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (15.2 +/- 10.8), and multiple inflammation index (564.3 x 10(3)), with an ICU mortality of 52.8% (P = .001) and 28-day mortality of 61.1% (P < .001). In ICU patients with sepsis aged >/= 85 years, hypermagnesemia at admission was a strong and independent predictor of mortality."
41189156,"Predictive model of the occurrence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in sepsis patients based on the combination of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and CD4+/CD8+ ratio.",2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a significant clinical challenge in sepsis patients, contributing to prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality. The dysregulated immune response and neuroinflammatory processes have been implicated in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for SAE based on a combination of immunological markers. A retrospective study was conducted at a single center from January 2020 to December 2023, involving 98 sepsis patients. Clinical, laboratory, and immunological parameters were analyzed. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic regression to identify independent risk factors, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the predictive performance of the combined model. The encephalopathy group had a significantly higher prevalence of pulmonary disease, vasopressor use, and elevated body temperature. Key laboratory findings included significantly lower levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (P < .001), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (P < .001), and a decreased CD4+/CD8 + ratio (P = .001) compared to the non-encephalopathy group. The logistic regression model confirmed these immunological markers as independent risk factors. The combined model of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and the CD4+/CD8 + ratio demonstrated a high predictive value with an AUC of 0.845. The combination of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and CD4+/CD8 + ratio provides a validated model for predicting SAE. These findings suggest that incorporating these immunological markers could improve risk stratification and early intervention. Future prospective, multicenter studies are recommended to validate this model for routine clinical practice."
41188325,Development and validation of an interpretable machine learning model for early prediction in patients with diabetes and sepsis.,2025,"We aimed to identify and validate key predictive factors influencing 28-day survival rates in patients with diabetes and sepsis and to develop a predictive model based on these factors to assist clinical decision-making. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined data from 303 patients with diabetes and sepsis treated at the Emergency Department of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, between June 2022 and November 2023. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method was employed to identify key predictive factors from 52 characteristics. A logistic regression model was then developed to create a nomogram for predicting 28-day survival rates. Model performance was assessed using calibration curves, Harrell's C-index, bootstrap validation, decision curve analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Six major predictive factors were identified: age, consciousness level, acid-base balance (pH level), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, myoglobin concentration, and the need for mechanical ventilation. The nomogram exhibited excellent concordance with the calibration curve, achieving a C-index of 0.833 and demonstrating robust discriminative capability, as validated through bootstrapping. Decision curve analysis indicated that the model provided a greater net benefit within a patient survival probability threshold ranging from 20% to 80%. ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.833, highlighting the model's strong discriminatory power. The predictive model developed in this study for the 28-day survival rate of patients with diabetes and sepsis demonstrates high predictive accuracy and serves as an effective clinical decision-making tool for healthcare professionals."
41187179,Interleukin-6 as a biomarker of sepsis and its clinical utility in predicting mortality: a prospective observational study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Majority of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) succumb to sepsis and its complications. However, currently available predictors fail to reliably gauge the severity of organ damage. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers that can accurately forecast outcomes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has emerged as a potential biomarker, with some studies suggesting its utility as an early predictor of multi-organ failure in sepsis. This study evaluated the role of IL-6 in predicting mortality in an Indian ICU setting. METHODOLOGY: This prospective observational study included adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and a quick SOFA score >/= 2. IL-6 levels, SOFA scores, and other clinical parameters were measured within 24 hours of admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: The overall ICU mortality rate was 39%. Multivariate analyses indicated that IL-6 levels, total SOFA scores, and number of antibiotics used were independently associated with mortality. The IL-6 levels showed strong positive correlations with the total SOFA score (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and individual organ dysfunction scores; particularly in cardiovascular (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), renal (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), and central nervous system (r = 0.6, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 levels, in combination with SOFA scores, provide a robust predictor of mortality in sepsis patients. The strong correlation between IL-6 levels and organ dysfunction scores suggests its potential as a biomarker for sepsis severity and progression."
41186206,"Sepsis Circulating Extracellular Vesicles: Associated Cytokine Profile, Cellular Proliferation, and Cytoprotective Activity Against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Cytotoxicity.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been linked with cytokine transportation and shown promising therapeutic and diagnostic potential in sepsis. Therefore, this study investigates the levels of cytokines associated with sepsis EVs and explores their therapeutic and diagnostic values. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty sepsis patients and ten healthy controls were included in this study. Plasma samples were used to isolate EVs using the Invitrogen Total Exosome Isolation Kit. EVs were fully characterized, and the cytoprotective activity and cytokine profile were determined using MTT and multiplex assays. RESULTS: Sepsis significantly increased the release, size, poly dispersion index, cellular proliferative and cytoprotective effects of isolated EVs, as well as altering the contents of their cytokines/chemokines and growth factors. Seven proteins were detected in EVs isolated from sepsis, but not healthy control patients. Two factors, IL-10 and basic FGF, were detected at significantly different levels in EV samples from sepsis vs. healthy control group. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the enrichment of IL-15, IL-10 and G-CSF in sepsis circulating EVs represents a biologically active protein signature with potential to both modulate the immune response and serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker."
41186083,Red Cell Distribution Width as a Predictor of Mortality in Neonates With Very Low Birth Weight: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Red cell distribution width (RDW) is recognised as a prognostic biomarker for predicting mortality in neonatal sepsis. However, its utility in forecasting 28-day mortality amongst very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates remains uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational, single-centre study involving neonates with a birth weight of less than 1500 g. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. RDW and the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-Perinatal Extension II (SNAPPE-II) were measured on Days 1 and 3 following admission to evaluate their predictive value for mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and corresponding areas under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the association between RDW and 28-day mortality, and to compare the predictive performance of RDW with SNAPPE-II. RESULTS: RDW levels were significantly higher in the non-survivor group (n = 35) compared to the survivor group (n = 70) on both Day 1 and 3 post-admission (p < 0.01 for both). Additionally, RDW was positively correlated with SNAPPE-II scores (r = 0.63 and 0.61, p < 0.01). ROC analysis revealed that RDW measured on Day 3 had a strong predictive value for 28-day mortality (AUC = 0.89, p < 0.01), which was significantly greater than the AUC for RDW on Day 1 (AUC = 0.73). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dynamic RDW changes (on post-admission Day 1-3) are a reliable prognostic biomarker for 28-day mortality in VLBW neonates, with predictive performance comparable to SNAPPE-II. It can serve as a low-cost, easily accessible tool for risk stratification in resource-limited settings.

41185489,Proteomic perspectives on platelet reactivity: towards precision thrombosis research.,2026,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in proteomics continue to expand our understanding of how protein systems regulate platelet function in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation. However, clinical translation of platelet proteomics findings remains limited. This review highlights recent studies of platelet proteomes and platelet function in development, aging, and disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have defined platelet proteomes associated with hypoactivity and hyperactivity across embryonic, neonatal, adult, and aging states. Phosphoproteomics has revealed signaling pathways linked to platelet dysregulation in aging, nutrient states, and specific diseases. Analyses of platelet secretomes and extracellular vesicles show agonist, therapy, and disease-associated signatures in diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Proteomic profiling of thrombi in myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis has uncovered distinct signatures implicating platelets in clot architecture, fibrinolysis resistance, and immune crosstalk. SUMMARY: Proteomics continues to define alterations in platelet composition shaped by development, aging, and disease, identifying molecular effectors of platelet function and pointing to biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Platelet proteomics is increasingly positioned to inform precision strategies in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders and to refine models of vascular biology and medicine."
41185477,Open data and artificial intelligence: a window of opportunity for septic patients in emergency departments.,2025,"Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in emergency departments (EDs). Despite advances in definitions and management protocols, early identification continues to be a critical challenge due to the nonspecific presentation of the disease. Early management is based on 3 fundamental pillars: source control, antibiotics, and hemodynamic resuscitation, all of which require early intervention. Tools such as the SOFA score, biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate), and protocols like the Sepsis Code have improved detection and management. However, the clinical heterogeneity of sepsis and limitations of current models hinder their universal implementation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key tool to improve early detection of sepsis through the analysis of large volumes of clinical data. Open data, following FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), facilitate the development of robust and personalized algorithms, minimizing bias and enhancing scientific collaboration. Spain generates vast amounts of clinical data in its EDs but lacks a unified database. The creation of an open system with data use agreements would enable the development of predictive models specific to its population. The use of A.I. in combination with specific databases promises to improve treatment personalization, reduce mortality, and optimize resources in sepsis care, changing the current paradigm of clinical management."
41181555,Construction and validation of a mortality prediction model for patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy: Interpretable machine learning approach.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a prevalent complication among critically ill sepsis patients with poor outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for predicting mortality in SAE patients to support clinical decision-making. METHODS: The study utilized two large critical care databases: the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 3.1) database for model construction and internal validation, and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD, version 2.0.1) for external validation. The XGBoost model was trained to predict patient mortality at 28 and 90 days after ICU admission, and performance was assessed by indicators including the area under the curve (AUC). To improve the interpretability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed key features affecting prognosis at both population and individual levels. RESULTS: A total of 4922 SAE patients were included, with 39 variables selected for model development. The XGBoost model performed best, with internal validation AUCs of 0.930 (95% CI: 0.917-0.942) and 0.906 (95% CI: 0.891-0.919) for 28-day and 90-day predictions, respectively. Notably, external validation achieved AUCs of 0.771 (95% CI: 0.748-0.792) and 0.759 (95% CI: 0.736-0.782), respectively. The Shapley value analytical framework was systematically applied to decode feature importance patterns and illuminate individual prognostic determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Validated across two large critical care databases, the interpretable XGBoost model serves as a reliable tool for mortality prediction in SAE patients, which may help clinicians identify high-risk SAE patients early and optimize management to improve patient outcomes."
41181367,Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Early Mortality Prediction in Septic Patients Using Routine Post-Diagnosis Clinical Data: A Multicenter Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of high-risk patients is crucial for improving outcomes. This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict early 7-day mortality in sepsis patients based on routine clinical data obtained immediately after diagnosis. METHODS: Data were collected from four tertiary hospitals across diverse regions in China. Seven ML algorithms were employed to construct the prediction model. Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC), calibration curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and clinical application. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the model and identify key predictors. RESULTS: Among 8729 patients, 752 (8.6%) died within 7 days after admission. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.767 (95% CI: 0.748-0.787) in training set, outperforming traditional scoring systems such as APACHE II (AUROC: 0.710, 95% CI: 0.698-0.721) and SOFA (AUROC: 0.718, 95% CI: 0.707-0.729). This performance was consistent in the test set. Key predictors of early mortality included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), blood chloride, and albumin levels. The SHAP analysis provided interpretable insights into the model. CONCLUSION: We developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of early 7-day mortality in sepsis patients based on routine clinical data obtained immediately after diagnosis and validated its potential as a clinically reliable tool, achieving an AUROC of 0.767 in the training set. The use of SHAP-based interpretation enhances model interpretability, enabling clinicians to better understand the factors influencing mortality, identify high-risk patients early, and implement timely interventions to improve outcomes."
41181338,Neonatal Sepsis in Low-Resource Emergency Settings: Evidence-Based Strategies for Early Recognition and Management.,2025,"This review highlights challenges in recognition, diagnosis, and management of neonatal sepsis in low-resource emergency settings. It discusses actionable, resource-adapted strategies to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using peer-reviewed research articles and global health guideline addressing neonatal sepsis. Neonatal sepsis is the leading cause of newborn deaths, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 99% of cases. Since limited access to blood cultures, biomarker testing, and antibiotic availability delay diagnosis and management. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance, poor infection control, and socioeconomic barriers worsen outcomes. However, emerging interventions including Point of care diagnostics, Kangaroo Mother Care, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence-based technologies demonstrate effectiveness. Early recognition and evidence-based management should be supported through affordable, feasible diagnostics, refined antibiotic use, and strengthened health infrastructure. Future initiatives must focus on innovations and international collaborations aimed at enhancing neonatal survival and health."
41180608,PTGDS: As a Specific Biomarker for Septic Cardiomyopathy.,2025,"PURPOSE: Screening specific biomarkers for Septic Cardiomyopathy (SCM) to provide research targets for early identification and prognosis assessment. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 20 sepsis patients and 10 healthy volunteers were collected for RNA sequencing. Subsequently, an intersection was taken between the differentially expressed genes in sepsis and the heart-specific expressed genes. This intersecting gene set was subjected to PPI analysis, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis. Survival analysis was employed to screen for potential hub gene and assess the relationship between the gene and prognosis. ROC curve was used to determine the diagnostic value of the hub target. Single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized to identify the cellular localization of the core gene, aiding in the selection of reliable cell lines for experimental validation. RESULTS: The sepsis differential gene intersected with 1000 heart-specific genes for 40 targets. Survival analysis identified PTGDS as a potential core gene, with its expression levels positively correlating with the prognosis of sepsis patients. Notably, PTGDS emerged as a promising candidate, achieving an AUC of 0.898 in ROC curve analysis for diagnosing sepsis. It is important to note that these findings are based on an initial, proof-of-principle cohort with a limited sample size. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that PTGDS is primarily expressed in NK cells and T cells. A violin plot showed that the expression of PTGDS was lower in the sepsis group compared to the normal group. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies PTGDS as a novel diagnostic biomarker for sepsis with potential involvement in SCM. These results highlight the potential of PTGDS as a target for future diagnostic development and mechanistic research, paving the way for improved clinical stratification of septic patients at risk of cardiac complications."
41180419,Significance of Serum Neuron-Specific Enolase in Patients With Sepsis and Its Association With Inflammatory Biomarkers.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Although survival rates in sepsis cases have improved, functional outcomes remain poor in many cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance and interrelationship of serum neurological and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Patients with sepsis who had good activities of daily living before admission were included. The following biomarkers were examined at 0, 1, and 3 days after admission: neuron-specific enolase (NSE); S100beta; high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1); interleukins 1, 6, and 8 (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8); interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma); and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Functional outcomes were defined using the modified Rankin Scale, with scores of 1 and 2 categorized as favorable outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 53 patients, 5 (9%) were non-survivors, and 8 (15%) were survivors with favorable outcomes. Biomarker analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of NSE, HMGB1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-gamma in non-survivors; however, no difference was observed in functional prognosis. On day 3, a significant association was observed between NSE and HMGB1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NSE levels were observed in non-surviving patients with sepsis, and NSE levels on day 3 were significantly correlated with the other inflammation-related biomarkers. These findings suggest that the progression of brain damage due to sepsis may be associated with inflammation, highlighting a potential target for future therapeutic strategies."
41180093,Corticosteroids in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a major health and socioeconomic burden worldwide. Although international guidelines have helped reduce crude mortality rates from sepsis by optimizing infection control and support of vital organ function, there are still no specific therapies for sepsis, other than corticosteroids. The aims of this narrative review were to provide readers with the most recent data on corticosteroids, as well as up-to-date evidence regarding their effects in patients with sepsis. Corticosteroids regulate the function of most cell types involved in host response to infections, through both genomic and non-genomic effects, reprogramming immune cells (via regulation of mitochondrial metabolism) toward anti-inflammatory types, restoring endothelial cell function and endothelium integrity, facilitating epithelium repair, and restoring vascular smooth muscle function, as well as organ perfusion. In patients with sepsis, these effects are achieved using supraphysiological doses of corticosteroids, equating to approximately 200 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent for 5-15 days, depending on the clinical context. The molecular and cellular effects of corticosteroids translate into prevention and reversal of the need for vasopressor, respiratory, and renal supportive therapies, as well as acceleration of organ function resolution, shorter intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and improved short- and mid-term survival. Remaining gaps in knowledge and evidence to inform practice include insufficient data about the effects of corticosteroids in children, a lack of reliable biomarkers to distinguish those patients who can benefit from treatment, and inadequate information about the effects of corticosteroids on the long-term sequelae of sepsis."
41180006,Persistent Subclinical Inflammation and Long-term Functional and Cognitive Outcomes After Dengue Shock and Septic Shock in Vietnam.,2025,"BACKGROUND: There have been no studies reporting functional, cognitive, inflammatory or endothelial outcomes after dengue shock (DS), or septic shock (SS) in Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study to follow-up adult survivors of DS and SS. At hospital discharge, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up, we measured health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), endothelial function (EndoPAT), and plasma biomarkers of inflammation (ferritin, IL-6, CRP) and endothelial activation (Ang1, Ang2, VCAM-1). RESULTS: Participants included survivors of DS (n = 130), SS (n = 26), and healthy controls (n = 25). Survivors of DS had median EQ-5D-5L visual analogue score (VAS) > 90/100 at all time-points, and mildly impaired MoCA scores at hospital discharge, which had normalized by 3 months (normal >/= 26, median [25th;75th centile] 23/30 [20;26] at discharge, 27/30 [25;29] by 3 months). Survivors of SS had lower median EQ-5D-5L VAS at all time-points (median [25th;75th centile] 80/100 [70;95] at discharge, and 90/100 [80;95] by 6 months), but MoCA scores never returned above the normal threshold (median 17/30 [13;19] at discharge, 20/30 [17;21] at 6 months). We found higher IL-6 and ferritin at all post-discharge time points in both DS and SS groups versus healthy controls (P < .01 for all comparisons). After 6 months, 38% with DS and 62% with SS still had ferritin levels >95th percentile of the healthy control distribution. There was little evidence of simultaneous endothelial activation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of persistent subclinical inflammation after DS, and SS in Vietnam; further research is required to determine the duration and clinical significance of this phenomenon."
41178622,Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells Promote Sepsis-Induced Immunosuppression in Alveolar Macrophages via Exosomal lncRNA Rmrp Release.,2026,"Secondary pneumonia, a common complication of sepsis-induced immunosuppression (SII), is closely linked to alveolar macrophage (AM) dysfunction primarily due to impaired glycolytic activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, it is found that exosomal RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (Rmrp), derived from type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-IIs), drives glycolytic defects and immune tolerance in AMs following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Targeted depletion of Rmrp in either AEC-IIs or AMs alleviated SII and secondary pneumonia induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 48 h post CLP. Mechanistically, Rmrp interacts with and inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of the RNA-binding protein zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36). This results in ZFP36 upregulation, subsequently accelerating the decay of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (Pfkfb3) mRNA by binding to its AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region. The degradation of Pfkfb3 mRNA leads to impaired glycolysis and suppresses immune responses in AMs after sepsis. Additionally, it is found that exosomal Rmrp levels are correlated with AM immune tolerance and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. These findings highlight the critical role of AEC-II-derived exosomal Rmrp in the pathogenesis of SII and secondary pneumonia. Importantly, the study suggests that exosomal Rmrp may serve as a biomarker for predicting and managing SII in clinical settings."

The findings highlight AI's growing potential in enhancing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes through data-driven and genomics-based innovations."
41177457,"Potential utility of the new ISTH overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring system for mortality risk assessment of patients with sepsis, hematopoietic neoplasms, and solid cancers: a nation-wide database study in Japan.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by systemic activation of coagulation pathways within the microvasculature, ultimately resulting in multiorgan dysfunction. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) subcommittee has recently introduced the 2025 overt DIC scoring system for clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the 2025 ISTH overt DIC scoring system and its proposed cutoff values for the mortality risk assessment in patients with diverse underlying diseases. METHODS: Patient data were extracted from the Japan Medical Data Center database, focusing on individuals diagnosed with sepsis, hematopoietic neoplasms, or solid cancers. Patients were included only if baseline levels of fibrinogen, platelets, prothrombin time (PT), and fibrin-related markers were available on the day of admission. Restricted cubic spline models were applied to evaluate nonlinear associations between coagulation parameters and in-hospital death. RESULTS: Data from 8181 patients with sepsis, 7548 patients with hematopoietic neoplasms, and 11 614 with solid cancers revealed a marked increase in mortality associated with fibrinogen < 2 g/L, platelets < 100 x 10(9)/L, PT >14 seconds, and D-dimer > 3 mg/L. Among these, PT prolongation and elevated D-dimer demonstrated the strongest associations with mortality. Across all 3 disease groups, in-hospital mortality showed a consistent positive correlation with the ISTH DIC sum score. CONCLUSION: These findings support the prognostic utility of the 2025 ISTH overt DIC scoring system and its proposed cutoff values in evaluating mortality risk among patients with sepsis, hematopoietic malignancies, and solid cancers."
41177118,Clinical value and pro-inflammatory mechanism of miR-503-5p as a novel diagnostic biomarker for Sepsis.,2025,"AIMS: Explore the expression of miR-503-5p in sepsis and its influence on the inflammatory response. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with sepsis were retrospectively selected as the research subjects, and 80 healthy individuals were simultaneously selected as the control group. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of miR-503-5p and related genes. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationships between variables, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to analyze the risk factors associated with sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of serum miR-503-5p levels for sepsis. Sepsis-model cells were created in vitro for the purpose of exploring the possible action mechanism of miR-503-5p in the context of sepsis. RESULTS: The expression of miR-503-5p in the serum of patients with sepsis is significantly upregulated, and it is positively correlated with the severity of the patients' condition and inflammatory indexes. miR-503-5p has a good diagnostic potential in sepsis. Furthermore, miR-503-5p exhibited a notable increase in expression within lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells, which facilitated the inflammatory process. Mechanistically, miR-503-5p exacerbates the inflammatory response in sepsis via targeted suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA). CONCLUSIONS: During sepsis, miR-503-5p shows elevated expression, and it facilitates the inflammatory response through the targeted suppression of PPARA."
41176813,Analysis of the time-course change of acute-phase energy metabolism in critically ill patients using untargeted metabolomics.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Critically ill patients are believed to experience a dynamic progression of energy metabolism according to the severity and phase of the illness. Although optimizing nutrition and physical therapy to the metabolic profile is recommended for better outcomes, the mechanisms for disease-related metabolic changes remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate key metabolites and pathways associated with time-course metabolic changes and clinical parameters in acute-phase critically ill patients using untargeted metabolomics. METHODS: We conducted a single-center prospective case series study on critically ill adults expected to require mechanical ventilation for at least 7 days in our intensive care unit. Data collection was started within 48 h of ICU admission, and daily serum samples from day 1 to day 7 were collected. Untargeted metabolomics was performed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included principal component analysis, (orthogonal) partial least squares discriminant analysis, and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Ten patients were analyzed during the study period from July 2021 to September 2022. A total of 123 metabolites were annotated by untargeted metabolomics, with significant time-course changes in galactonic acid, ornithine, and l-arginine. Pathway analysis indicated alterations in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. A subgroup analysis showed distinct metabolic profiles for sepsis and non-sepsis patients, with creatine phosphate, uric acid, and creatinine being significant markers. In sepsis patients, metabolic changes strongly correlated with the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. CONCLUSION: Using untargeted metabolomics, we annotated several metabolites and metabolic pathways strongly associated with time-course changes in the metabolic profile. In addition, it is suggested that nutritional therapy can be optimized according to specific pathophysiology."
41175845,"Early prediction of septic shock in ICU patients using machine learning: development, external validation, and explainability with SHAP.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a severe and life-threatening complication of sepsis associated with high mortality. Early identification remains challenging due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation of patients, incomplete real-world ICU data, and the dynamic pathophysiological progression of sepsis. This study aimed to develop and externally validate machine learning (ML) models to predict the progression to septic shock in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: Data were extracted from two large critical care databases: MIMIC-IV (training set) and eICU-CRD (validation set). Variable selection was performed using LASSO regression. Six ML algorithms-random forest (RF), XGBoost, support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, and naive Bayes-were trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset and externally validated on the eICU dataset. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy. Model interpretability was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: A total of 11,383 septic patients were included, of whom 2,259 in the training cohort and 1,212 in the validation cohort developed septic shock. The RF model achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.785, balanced accuracy of 0.717, and an F1 score of 0.511. SHAP analysis identified SOFA score, heart rate, creatinine, SAPS II, and OASIS as the most influential predictors. CONCLUSION: The proposed ML model enables early prediction of septic shock using routinely collected ICU data. SHAP-based interpretation enhances transparency and clinical interpretability. This approach may assist in timely risk stratification, support data-driven decision-making, and ultimately improve outcomes in patients with sepsis."
41175281,"Transforming cytokine diagnostics: AI, multiplexing, and point-of-care biosensing technologies.",2025,"Cytokines are central regulators of immune responses and have emerged as key biomarkers in diverse pathological conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Conventional laboratory methods for cytokine detection, while accurate, often lack the speed, portability, and multiplexing capacity required for timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in biosensor technology-particularly at the point-of-care (POC)-are reshaping this landscape by enabling rapid, decentralized, and sensitive detection of cytokine panels in complex biological samples. AI-enabled multiplex POC platforms now achieve limits of detection as low as 0.01-100 pg/mL, with dynamic ranges spanning 3-4 orders of magnitude, using 1-50 microL of sample and delivering results within 5-30 min. Compared with centralized single-plex workflows, these systems provide faster, lower-volume, and more clinically actionable testing. Artificial intelligence further strengthens performance by providing calibrated predictive outputs, uncertainty estimates, and drift monitoring. This review highlights the convergence of multiplexed biosensing strategies with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the analytical performance, interpretability, and clinical utility of cytokine diagnostics. We first discuss the evolution from traditional platforms to portable and miniaturized systems, and then summarize emerging review literature addressing cytokine biosensing in contexts such as sepsis, metabolic disorders, and systemic inflammation. Next, we examine experimental studies demonstrating POC-compatible platforms for multiplexed cytokine detection, and finally focus on next-generation biosensors that integrate machine learning (ML) algorithms-including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision-tree models-for autonomous signal processing and decision support. Despite challenges in validation, hardware integration, and explainability, these technologies hold transformative potential for real-time immune monitoring, precision medicine, and global health applications."
41175248,2D Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene nanozymes based electrochemical MicroRNA biosensor and application to early diagnosis of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"MicroRNA detection-based molecular diagnostic methods offer a favorable pathway for the early diagnosis of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), which is crucial for reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. In this work, a highly sensitive electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for the determination of serum miR-452-5p, an emerging biomarker for SA-AKI, leveraging the novel Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene nanozymes and catalytic hairpin assembly isothermal amplification. Surprisingly, the two-dimensional Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene nanozymes demonstrated remarkable electro-catalytic activity towards choline, wihch was attributed to the strong adsorption interaction between the oxygen atoms on the Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene surface and the hydroxyl group of choline. Based on above-mentioned characteristic of Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene nanozymes, a cascading catalytic amplification strategy by integrating Ti(3)C(2)T(x) MXene with alkaline phosphatase using phosphorylcholine chloride as the substrate was designed, thereby achieving highly efficient electrochemical signal amplification. The electrochemical biosensing approach exhibited remarkable sensitivity for miR-452-5p detection, with a linear response over a concentration range from 0.1 fM to 10 nM and a low detection limit of 0.09 fM. Additionally, the developed electrochemical biosensor for direct serum miR-452-5p detection present a diagnostic efficiency of 96% in clinical samples analysis, highlighting its strong potential for the early detection and risk assessment of SA-AKI."
41173335,"Nanomotion-based technology for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing among adult patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital with Gram-negative bacteraemia: a prospective, single arm, comparative diagnostic accuracy study.",2026,"OBJECTIVE: Investigate performances and turnaround time of Resistell Phenotech antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), a device using the new nanomotion technology, compared with reference methods. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, and comparative diagnostic accuracy study including adult patients, who signed informed consent, hospitalized at a single 1200-bed tertiary-care centre in Switzerland, with Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia from 18 June 2021 to 19 February 2024. Outcome measures were categorical agreement (very major discrepancies, major discrepancies, and minor discrepancies), as well as time from positive blood cultures to AST results, from matrix-assisted laser desoprtion ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identification to AST results and AST start to end. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were also assessed. VITEK 2 (Biomerieux) and Kirby-Bauer were used as reference directly on positive blood cultures per laboratory routine. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05002413). RESULTS: We included 253 adult patients, hospitalized with E. coli or K. pneumoniae bacteraemia. Resistell Phenotech AST showed 97.6% (95% CI, 94.6-99.0) (98.0% [95% CI, 94.2-99.3]) overall sensitivity compared with Kirby-Bauer (and VITEK 2). Concerning susceptibility, for both ceftriaxone-pathogen combinations, sensitivity reached 100% compared with Kirby-Bauer (E. coli 95% CI, 95.8-100.0; K. pneumoniae 95% CI, 89.0-100.0) (and VITEK 2 [E. coli 95% CI, 93.9-100.0; K. pneumoniae 95% CI, 85.7-100.0]); specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 73.0-99.0) (91.7% [95% CI, 64.6-98.5]) for E. coli and 100% (72.2-100.0 Kirby-Bauer; 67.6-100.0 VITEK 2) for K. pneumoniae. Ciprofloxacin-E. coli reached 94.6% (95% CI, 87.9-97.7) (95.5% [95% CI, 87.6-98.5]) sensitivity and 83.3% (95% CI, 66.4-92.7) (79.2% [95% CI, 59.5-90.8]) specificity. The Resistell Phenotech AST analysis was >10 hours faster than reference method, averaging 15.7 hours (SD +/- 6) from blood culture positivity to results, 10.9 (SD +/- 7.3) from MALDI-TOF MS identification to AST, and 4.1 (SD +/- 0.1) from start to end of AST. CONCLUSIONS: Nanomotion enables rapid AST with strong ceftriaxone results but needs improvement for ciprofloxacin. Further device developments are required, including multi-channel device and sensitive at high dose category."
41171477,The ferroptosis-related gene MAFG screened by machine learning is associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis.,2025,"Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death induced by ferrous ions and lipid peroxidation. However, the mechanisms of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in sepsis have not been studied thoroughly. We performed differential analysis using GSE65682, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were intersected with FRGs to obtain the differentially expressed FRGs. We constructed a random forest model to explore characteristic FRGs for sepsis diagnosis using the training set and verified its predictive efficacy using the testing set. There are 43 differentially expressed FRGs and the top five FRGs in the model are MAFG, QSOX1, KLF2, TXN, and PEBP1. Meanwhile, three genes remained after the univariate Cox analysis, survival analysis and nomogram, but only MAFG was validated to be associated with sepsis prognosis. MAFG was selected as the most diagnostically and prognostically significant FRG based on the following evidence: (1) consistently significant overexpression across multiple datasets, (2) the highest MeanDecreaseGini score in the random forest model, (3) the largest hazard ratio in univariate Cox regression analysis, (4) a strong association with patient survival demonstrated by the nomogram, and (5) an AUC of 0.64 (p < 0.05) in GSE185263 in the ROC analysis for sepsis prognosis. Subsequently, TXN was predicted as a ferroptosis-related potential target for the transcription factor MAFG, and their elevation in sepsis was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Ultimately, we discovered that MAFG was mainly localized in monocytes by single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, which was significantly upregulated in sepsis and non-survivors of sepsis. In this study, we identified MAFG as a potential candidate FRG related to the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis, although further validation is required, which broadens novel insights into the therapeutic targets of sepsis and the role of ferroptosis in sepsis."
41169829,NGAL Superiority to Creatinine in the Diagnosis of Renal Injury in a Pediatric Tertiary Hospital Setting.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is related with higher death rates, longer hospital admissions, and an increased chance of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Serum creatinine, a conventional biomarker for AKI diagnosis, has limitations since it rises slowly after renal injury and is dependent on muscle mass and hydration state. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has emerged as a promising early biomarker, appearing in urine and plasma within two hours of kidney injury. This study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of NGAL against serum creatinine in diagnosing AKI in pediatric patients. The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of *NGAL in diagnosing AKI in pediatric patients compared to serum creatinine. By assessing the reliability of NGAL, the study aims to enhance early detection and management techniques for AKI in children. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional analytic study was carried out over a 12-month period at a tertiary hospital's pediatric nephrology department. The study included 200 children aged 1 month to 18 years who had been admitted with symptoms that put them at risk for AKI, such as sepsis, dehydration, and nephrotoxic medication exposure. Blood samples were taken at admission and 24 hours later to determine serum creatinine and NGAL levels. An enzymatic colorimetric technique was used to determine serum creatinine, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect NGAL. Data was analyzed with SPSS software, and diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULT: NGAL revealed superior diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 against 0.72 for creatinine. NGAL demonstrated greater sensitivity (92% vs. 68%) and specificity (88% vs. 62%), especially in infants. The ROC curve demonstrated NGAL's excellent diagnostic performance in all pediatric age groups. Conclusion: This study shows that NGAL is a more reliable early biomarker for AKI in pediatric patients than serum creatinine. Its implementation in clinical practice could lead to early diagnosis and treatments, lowering the risk of severe kidney injury and improving pediatric patient outcomes."
41169421,Stage prediction of acute kidney injury in sepsis patients using explainable machine learning approaches.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and serious complication among sepsis patients, closely associated with high mortality rates and substantial disease burden. Early prediction of AKI is vital for prompt and effective intervention and improved prognosis. This research seeks to construct and assess forecasting frameworks that leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to anticipate AKI progression in high-risk sepsis patients. METHODS: This study utilized the MIMIC-IV database, a large, publicly available critical care dataset containing comprehensive, de-identified electronic health records of over 70,000 ICU admissions at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to extract sepsis patient data for model training and test. Following feature selection, various machine learning algorithms were employed, including Decision Tree (DT), Efficient Neural Network (ENet), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Multinomial Mixture Model (Multinom), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A five-fold cross-test strategy was implemented to minimize bias and assess model performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to interpret the results. RESULTS: A total of 6,866 critically ill sepsis patients were analyzed, of whom 5,896 developed AKI during hospitalization The RF model demonstrated superior performance, attaining an average AUC score of 0.89 on the ROC curve. SHAP analysis provided detailed insights into feature importance, including urine output, BMI, SOFA score, and maximum blood urea nitrogen, enhancing the clinical applicability of the model. CONCLUSION: The machine learning models developed in this study effectively predicted the stages of AKI in severely ill sepsis patients, with the Random Forest model demonstrating optimal performance. SHAP analysis offered crucial insights into the risk factors, facilitating timely and personalized interventions within a clinical setting. Additional multi-center research is essential to confirm the validity of these findings and to ultimately improve patient outcomes and quality of life."
41169382,ADAM8 in macrophages exacerbates sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by impeding efferocytosis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is a life-threatening complication characterized by acute cardiac dysfunction during sepsis., and macrophages play a crucial role in SICM pathogenesis. ADAM8 has been implicated in inflammation-driven diseases, yet its role in SICM remains uncharted. METHODS: Mouse models of SICM were established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Macrophage-specific ADAM8 knockout (CKO) mice were generated. RNA transcriptome sequencing was conducted on left ventricular tissues sourced from ADAM8 CKO mice, as well as on RAW264.7 cell lines that were treated with both ADAM8 knockdown (KD) lentivirus and LPS. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ADAM8 expression is significantly upregulated in cardiac macrophages of SICM mice using single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence. Macrophage-specific ADAM8 CKO mice exhibited preserved cardiac function, reduced myocardial injury markers, attenuated apoptosis (decreased Bax/Bcl2 ratio), and enhanced survival in both LPS-induced and CLP sepsis models. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of cytokine-cytokine receptor pathways in CKO hearts, suggesting diminished inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, ADAM8 deficiency promoted macrophage efferocytosis by increasing phagocytic receptors (MerTK) while reducing soluble Mer (sMer) generation. Conversely, sMer administration abolished the cardioprotective effects in CKO mice, exacerbating cardiac dysfunction and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify ADAM8 as a critical regulator of macrophage-mediated inflammation and impaired macrophage efferocytosis in SICM. Targeting ADAM8 or its downstream effectors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis-induced cardiac complications."
41169360,Prognostic value of presepsin in sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Presepsin, an innate immune activation biomarker, shows potential for predicting the prognosis of sepsis, but its predictive accuracy remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate its efficiency for predicting the risk of mortality in sepsis and septic shock. METHODS: Per PRISMA guidelines, four databases were searched until January 2025. Sixteen observational studies with 2,066 patients were included. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC were calculated using bivariate random-effects models. The sources of heterogeneity were explored via subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Study quality was assessed with QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Presepsin showed moderate accuracy for predicting the risk of mortality (pooled AUC 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76-0.83). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 76% (95% CI: 69-82%) and 70% (95% CI: 59-78%), respectively. Sensitivity was notably higher in patients with septic shock (90%) compared to those with sepsis (75%), whereas specificity was comparatively lower (50% vs. 77%). Substantial heterogeneity stemmed from threshold variability and geographic differences (particularly in Korean cohorts). Prospective studies had higher sensitivity (80%) than retrospective studies (60%). No publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin is a pragmatic biomarker for predicting the risk of mortality, with enhanced sensitivity in septic shock. Presepsin may be integrated into clinical decision-making for early intervention. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, identifier CRD42025639268."
41168271,The significance and role of the receptor and inflammatory factors in acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2025,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and severe hypoxemia, with mortality rates remaining high despite advances in supportive care. Cytokine dysregulation and genetic susceptibility are thought to play central roles in its pathogenesis, but data in Chinese populations remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the associations of circulating cytokine levels and genetic polymorphisms with ARDS risk. We enrolled 240 patients with ARDS and 420 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Serum concentrations of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were quantified by ELISA. Selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR and cytokine genes were genotyped using PCR-RFLP with rigorous quality control, including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checks. Associations with ARDS risk were estimated using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Multiplicity was addressed with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). ARDS patients exhibited significantly elevated serum concentrations of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-alpha compared with controls (all p < 0.05), with IL-1 and TNF-alpha remaining significant after FDR correction. Several genetic variants were strongly associated with ARDS susceptibility, including TLR2 - 196 to - 174 del (OR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.77), TLR9 rs352140 AA (OR = 2.97; 95% CI, 2.16-4.08), IL-1B + 3954 TT (OR = 5.01; 95% CI, 2.85-8.81), IL-10 - 1082 GA/AA, TNF-alpha - 308 AA, and IFN-gamma + 874 TT. After FDR control, significant associations persisted for TLR2 - 196 to - 174 del, TLR9 rs352140, and IL-1B + 3954. Sensitivity analyses stratified by ARDS etiology (pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, other) yielded consistent results. Both inflammatory dysregulation and host genetic variation contribute to ARDS susceptibility in Chinese patients. Elevated cytokines (IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-10) and specific polymorphisms (TLR2 - 196 to - 174 del, TLR9 rs352140, IL-1B + 3954) may serve as candidate biomarkers for risk stratification. These findings warrant validation in larger multicenter cohorts and exploration of their prognostic value in clinical practice."
41166072,Toward Standardized ICU Trauma Resuscitation via Markov Decision Processes.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Guideline-based recommendations for post-hemostasis resuscitation in trauma patients remain limited. This study aimed to define an interpretable Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model intensive care unit (ICU) trauma resuscitation and evaluate its potential to support clinical decision-making using a previously established framework from sepsis care. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: High-volume, Level I academic trauma center. PATIENTS: Adult trauma patients admitted to the ICU between 2012-2019 with lactate >/= 2 mmol/L. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was framed as a sequential decision-making problem using an MDP and focused on intravenous fluid (IVF) and vasopressor (norepinephrine and vasopressin) administration. Resuscitation was defined as concluding 1-hour after the last intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus (>/=250 ml) or vasopressor administration within the first 48 hours of ICU admission. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent was trained to recommend IVF and vasopressor treatments. Learned policy actions were compared to observed clinical practice using McNemar's test, and model performance was evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: 4,305 subjects were included; 3,027 (70%) met the resuscitation endpoint (median resuscitation time: 22 hours). The learned policy aligned with clinical practice but differed significantly in vasopressor use, recommending norepinephrine less often (4%+/-6% vs. 12%, p<0.001) and vasopressin more frequently (13%+/-12% vs. 4%, p<0.001). IVF >/=250ml was recommended in 19%+/-12% of decisions vs. 13% in observed practice. Offline evaluation estimated the learned policy underperformed the behavior policy, consistent with prior findings in sepsis. CONCLUSION: This study presents a clinically grounded MDP framework for trauma resuscitation that enables RL to be applied retrospectively in critical care. The learned policy mirrored trends previously observed in sepsis, aligning with clinician behavior while exposing variation in vasopressor use. These findings validate the relevance of the proposed MDP in trauma care, demonstrate feasibility of applying RL in this context, and establish a foundation for future modeling, evaluation, and decision support."
41165291,Critical care challenges after gastrointestinal surgery.,2025,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review addresses the critical care challenges encountered after gastrointestinal surgery, emphasizing the high incidence of postoperative complications and the pivotal role of early recognition and management in improving patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite advances in minimally invasive surgery, postoperative morbidity following major gastrointestinal procedures remains substantial. Anastomotic leaks, particularly after esophagectomy and colorectal resections, are among the most feared complications, with significant clinical and economic consequences. Infectious complications, such as pneumonia and intra-abdominal sepsis, continue to drive ICU admissions and prolong recovery. General complications including acute kidney injury and postoperative delirium are prevalent, especially among frail and sarcopenic patients. Predictive models and early warning tool, including machine learning algorithms, are emerging to assist clinicians in anticipating complications. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, laparoscopic approaches, and multimodal analgesia have shown efficacy in reducing morbidity and hospital length of stay. SUMMARY: Postoperative critical care in gastrointestinal surgery must integrate risk stratification, vigilant monitoring, and evidence-based interventions. Optimizing perioperative pathways through ERAS protocols, tailored nutrition, and modern analgesic techniques can improve outcomes. Ongoing research into predictive models and individualized care strategies will further enhance the safety and effectiveness of gastrointestinal surgical care."
41163637,Acute Fatty Liver in Pregnancy: Literature Review.,2025,"Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening obstetric emergency that typically arises in the third trimester. Although uncommon, its rapid onset, multisystem involvement, and historically high mortality make it an essential condition for clinicians to recognize and manage promptly. Its pathogenesis has been linked to defects in fatty acid metabolism and an abnormality in mitochondrial beta oxidation is a recognised cause of AFLP in a subset of cases. The clinical significance of AFLP lies in its dramatic course and overlap with other hepatic disorders of pregnancy such as haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, preeclampsia, and viral hepatitis. Misdiagnosis or delayed recognition can result in rapid maternal and fetal deterioration. Early suspicion, timely diagnosis, and expedited delivery have transformed outcomes over the past few decades in reducing maternal and perinatal mortality. AFLP is associated with multi-organ dysfunction. Hepatic complications include jaundice, coagulopathy, hypoglycaemia, and fulminant liver failure. Systemic complications frequently reported are acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pancreatitis, sepsis, and encephalopathy. Obstetric complications include postpartum haemorrhage and preterm delivery, while fetal complications range from intrauterine growth restriction and hypoglycaemia to intrauterine death. Intensive care admission is often required, and in rare cases liver transplantation may be necessary when hepatic failure does not reverse after delivery. Despite its severity, prognosis has improved dramatically with heightened clinical awareness and advances in perinatal and critical care. Maternal survival rates now improve especially in tertiary centres with timely diagnosis and intervention. Fetal prognosis is closely tied to early delivery, usually by induction or caesarean section depending on maternal and fetal stability. Fetal prognosis remains more guarded, with outcomes influenced by gestational age at diagnosis, intrauterine compromise, and neonatal complications of prematurity. AFLP represents a rare but critical complication of pregnancy, demanding rapid recognition and multidisciplinary management. Its importance is underscored not only by its acute threat to maternal and fetal survival but also by its link to underlying metabolic disorders with intergenerational implications. Literature over the recent few years demonstrates significant progress in survival outcomes, yet ongoing challenges include improving diagnostic accuracy, clarifying genetic risk, and standardizing management strategies across diverse healthcare settings. Continued research into early biomarkers, targeted therapies, and global epidemiological patterns will be vital for further improving prognosis and reducing preventable maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality."
41162939,Development and validation of a machine-learning model for predicting prognosis in critically ill patients undergoing major surgery.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Major surgery can result in elevated mortality rates, poorer prognoses, and extended hospital stays. This study sought to develop and validate an effective machine-learning model capable of accurately forecasting outcomes in critically ill patients who have undergone major surgery. METHODS: Using the publicly accessible Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, we developed and validated multiple machine-learning(ML) models to predict postoperative outcomes in critically ill patients who had at least an overnight ICU stay after major surgery. The primary outcome of the present study was the 28-day mortaliy. The secondary outcome were defined as hospital mortality. Seven predictive models were tested to forecast prognosis, with the highest-performing model selected based on its accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An advanced model, eXtremely Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), was created using all variables, followed by a streamlined model built from 10 features chosen for their importance and clinical applicability. The performance of both models was assessed using Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), while survival analyses distinguished high- and low-risk groups within the validation sets. RESULTS: A cohort of 2,335 critically ill patients who had undergone major surgery were included in the MIMIC-IV cohorts. The full XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 80.6% and an AUC of 0.828 (95% CI:0.769-0.887), indicating high predictive power. A more practical selection model with 10 features demonstrated a slightly lower AUC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.762-0.886) but offered advantages in clinical usability. The ten key features were identified based on their feature importance, which included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, mechanical ventilation, ARDS and sepsis complications, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), respiratory rate, and marital status. The DCA indicated that at low thresholds(<20%), utilizing the XGBoost model to predict patient prognosis would yield a net benefit. Additionally, survival curves showed a clear distinction between high- and low-risk groups based on predictions from both the full and selection XGBoost models, highlighting the models' effectiveness in distinguishing patient outcomes. A cohort of 223 critically ill patients who had undergone major surgery in a university teaching hospital was analyzed. The AUC of the compact model in the external validation was 0.749 (95% CI:0.670-0.827). CONCLUSIONS: This study developed two XGBoost model variants that outperform other ICU predictive methods for forecasting the prognosis of patients undergoing major surgery. These models have the potential to assist healthcare providers in making more informed decisions, thereby improving clinical outcomes in the ICU setting. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

41160668,Identifying correlates of viral rebound timing and viral control in SHIV-infected infant macaques after ART interruption.,2025,"Evaluation of HIV cure strategies requires antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption, but ethical and clinical considerations make this difficult in children. Here, we used a pediatric preclinical model of simian-HIV (SHIV) infection to uncover features associated with time to viral rebound (TTR) and posttreatment control (PTC) of rebound viremia after ART interruption to inform the design of studies testing cure interventions. We assessed 141 variables in SHIV-infected infant rhesus macaques in three staggered ART initiation groups and during subsequent analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Viral rebound occurred in 25 of 30 macaques within 7 to 98 days of ATI, with TTR delayed in the early ART group compared with the intermediate and late ART groups. Peak plasma viral load pre-ART was the most important correlate of TTR, with increased model performance through the successive inclusion of six additional viral and immune variables. The odds of PTC were reduced with higher SHIV RNA in rectal CD4(+) T cells pre-ATI; conversely, higher frequencies of Ki67(+) effector memory CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes increased the likelihood of PTC. RNA sequencing of CD4(+) T cells pre-ATI revealed a down-regulated metabolic and immune gene signature in macaques with PTC. Analysis of the early ART group alone implicated transforming growth factor-beta signaling genes in lack of viral rebound off ART. This comprehensive investigation reveals major determinants of viral rebound dynamics after ART interruption that should be validated and explored as potential biomarkers to screen children with HIV being considered for ATI."
41160228,The diagnostic and prognostic utility of complete blood count (CBC)-derived indices in dogs with sepsis caused by canine parvoviral infection.,2025,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of complete blood count (CBC)-derived indices incorporating red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) parameters in dogs that met the criteria for sepsis due to canine parvovirosis (CP). Fifty-two client-owned dogs with CP and ten healthy controls were enrolled in this study. CBC-derived indices, along with serum CRP and albumin concentrations, were evaluated before (T0) and after treatment (T1 and T3). Dogs meeting the criteria for sepsis exhibited statistically significantly higher RDW/L (P < 0.001), MCV/L (P < 0.001), MPV/L (P < 0.001), PLT/L (P < 0.001), PCT/L (P < 0.001), and PDW/L ratios (P < 0.001) compared to the control group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed high diagnostic and prognostic performance for MCV/L (AUC: >0.949) and MPV/L (AUC: >0.961). In conclusion, CBC-derived indices incorporating RBC and PLT parameters can provide useful information about the diagnosis and prognosis in dogs with sepsis produced by parvovirus. These findings, if corroborated in larger studies, would support their integration into clinical practice to enhance the early detection and risk stratification in canine sepsis."
41159224,Usefulness of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in enhancing diagnostic accuracy of infection among severely ill patients presenting to the emergency department.,2025,"Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality and continues to pose substantial diagnostic challenges in its early stages. Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW), a parameter automatically integrated into complete blood counts by next-generation haematology analysers, has emerged as a promising biomarker. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of MDW compared with traditional markers (C-reactive protein and leukocyte count) and clinical scoring systems (SOFA and NEWS) in a cohort of critically ill patients presenting to a hospital emergency department, with the aim of distinguishing those with infection from those whose severity was attributable to other causes."
41158653,Assessment of the influence of vitamin D in patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to extensively estimate the interrelation between vitamin D (VD) and clinical results among both pediatric and adult sepsis patients. METHODS: A search was implemented through four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) up to February 2025. Meta-analysis was implemented utilizing Stata 15 and Meta-Disc software. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies were included, encompassing 1,208 pediatric and neonatal sepsis patients, and 60,566 adult sepsis patients. The results showed that the average VD level in neonates with sepsis was 12.99 (95% CI: 8.11, 17.87), and the average VD level in children was 24.84 (95% CI: 21.34, 28.33). Their VD levels were considerably lower relative to healthy individuals or those without sepsis, with statistical distinction (p < 0.05). The aggregated prevalence of VD deficiency and insufficiency was 54%. When VD levels were <30 ng/mL, the aggregate prevalence of deficiency and insufficiency was the highest at 76%. A considerable interrelation between VD deficiency and mortality was identified, contrasted with the control group (p < 0.05). Among adults with sepsis, the average VD level was 17.12 (95% CI: 14.19, 20.05). Relative to the healthy cohort, VD levels substantially declined, with statistical distinction (p < 0.05); relative to those without sepsis, there was no statistical distinction in VD levels (p = 0.05). The pooled prevalence of VD deficiency and insufficiency was 55%. The deficiency of VD was considerably correlated with both the incidence and mortality of sepsis (p < 0.001). Supplementation with VD did not reduce the length of ICU stay (p = 0.67), but it can considerably reduce the risk of death (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of VD to forecast mortality among adult sepsis patients were 81 and 31%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D status in both pediatric and adult sepsis individuals was predominantly in a deficient state, and the prevalence of VD deficiency and insufficiency is relatively high. VD deficiency was considerably linked to elevated mortality among pediatric sepsis individuals and also the incidence and mortality of adult sepsis individuals. VD may serve as a valuable biomarker to forecast mortality among adult sepsis individuals. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420250651346, CRD420250651346."
41158471,Potential of interleukin-7 in sepsis as a biomarker and therapeutic agent: a narrative review.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the dynamics of endogenous interleukin-7 (IL-7) and its associated regulatory factors in sepsis, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which exogenous IL-7 may confer therapeutic benefits. The ultimate objective is to evaluate its dual potential as a clinical biomarker and as a novel therapeutic agent. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to April 24, 2025, using terms such as Interleukin-7, CD127, CYT107, interleukin-7 receptor, sepsis, septic shock, and lymphopenia. RESULTS: In sepsis, endogenous IL-7 levels rise from a low baseline and may remain elevated for a prolonged period. Exogenous IL-7 can enhance immune function, regulate inflammation, and exert anti-apoptotic effects. Endogenous IL-7 levels may represent a potential prognostic indicator in sepsis. Exogenous IL-7 may modulate immune function in patients with clinical sepsis but does not reduce mortality. CONCLUSION: Endogenous IL-7 is closely associated with sepsis, whereas exogenous IL-7 shows promise for aiding the recovery of patients with sepsis, although further research is required."
41157249,AI-Powered Early Detection of Sepsis in Emergency Medicine.,2025,"Sepsis remains a critical medical emergency caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection, with timely detection and intervention being essential for improving survival rates. Traditional methods often rely on clinician intuition and structured scoring systems, which may be time-intensive and prone to variability. To address these limitations, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative, bringing precision and efficiency to sepsis detection. This study investigates both white-box and complex black-box ML models applied to patient data collected across the continuum of care, including monitoring at the urgent care, en route in ambulances, and diagnostics conducted within hospital emergency department settings themselves. White-box models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, are valued for their interpretability, allowing healthcare providers to understand and trust the reasoning behind predictions. Meanwhile, black-box models like deep neural networks and support vector machines deliver superior accuracy but pose challenges in clinical transparency. This trade-off between explainability and performance is explored in detail, supported by experimental results aimed at identifying the most effective computational strategies for early sepsis recognition across diverse healthcare environments."
41157235,"Oral Treatment with the Vimentin-Targeting Compound ALD-R491 Mitigates Hyperinflammation, Multi-Organ Injury, and Mortality in CLP-Induced Septic Mice.",2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition driven by a dysregulated host response to infection, with high mortality and few treatment options. Decades of failed drug development underscore the urgent need for therapies with novel mechanisms of action. Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, acts as a network hub that senses and integrates cellular signals. Its involvement in key sepsis pathologies, including infection, hyperinflammation, immunosuppression, coagulopathy and metabolic dysregulation, positions it as a potential therapeutic target. This study evaluated the efficacy of ALD-R491, a novel small-molecule vimentin modulator, in a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice received ALD-R491 prophylactically or therapeutically, alone or with ceftriaxone. The treatment significantly reduced serum levels of key biomarkers of sepsis, including C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate (Lac), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and dose-dependently improved the survival of septic mice. Organ-specific analysis confirmed the effects of ALD-R491 in mitigating hyperinflammation and multi-organ injury. The treatment reduced pulmonary edema and inflammation; preserved liver tissue architecture and improved hepatic function with lowered alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST); decreased kidney tubular damage; and improved renal function with lowered creatinine/blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These preclinical findings indicate that the vimentin-targeting agent ALD-R491 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for sepsis and merits further clinical investigation."
41157190,The 15th Anniversary of Life-Sepsis Trials.,2025,"Clinical trials of drugs specifically targeting the sepsis response have frequently produced negative or inconclusive results. This has largely been due to the broad heterogeneity of enrolled patient populations, particularly when inclusion was based on the presence of the non-specific systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. The heterogeneity may have diluted any possible treatment effect: while some patients may have benefited from the intervention under investigation, others will have been harmed, resulting in an overall null-effect. Furthermore, an underlying infection is not always required for immune-modulating interventions to be effective; for example, patients with severe acute pancreatitis, but no infection, may still benefit from such therapies. There is therefore a need for better patient stratification or subphenotyping to identify those most likely to benefit from a particular therapy. Several trials have already adopted this approach using prognostic and/or predictive enrichment strategies. For example, measurements of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) could be used to identify candidates most likely to respond to anti-TREM therapies, or patients with coagulopathy or specific inflammatory patterns could be selected for treatments like thrombomodulin or activated protein C. However, challenges remain, including the need for more rapid tools that can be used at the bedside to inform real-time treatment decisions given the rapidly evolving nature of the sepsis response. Nevertheless, the era of broad-spectrum ""sepsis drugs"" is now giving way to more selective, personalized interventions tailored to individual biological profiles, offering a more promising pathway for future therapeutic development-even in the absence of infection."
41155752,Laboratory and Microbiological Considerations in Sepsis-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction.,2025,"Introduction: Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction (SICD) is a transient cardiac disfunction, with variable described prevalence and uncertain prognostic. This study aimed to characterize the laboratory and microbiological findings in critically ill patients with sepsis who developed left ventricular (LV) or biventricular systolic dysfunction. Methods: Patients who required intensive care unit hospitalization for sepsis were screened retrospectively. Only patients with positive cultures and echocardiography performed within 24 h from admission were included. The exclusion criteria were infective endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, history of cardiomyopathy, severe valve disease, end-stage organ or oncological disease. Cardiac function was appreciated on transthoracic echocardiography, using LV ejection fraction for the left ventricle and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) for the right ventricle. SICD was confirmed if the systolic dysfunction found upon admission was reversible within 7-10 days. Results: A total of 100 patients with positive cultures were included. The median age was 73 and 55% were male. SICD was diagnosed in 14% of patients. Patients with SICD were more likely to develop septic shock and had longer hospital and intensive care unit stay. In-hospital mortality was 44% with no significant difference between SICD and non-SICD patients. Laboratory markers upon hospital admission showed that SICD patients had significantly higher values of lactate and transaminases. Cardiac (troponin and NT-proBNP) and inflammation markers (leukocytes, neutrophils, NLR, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) had higher values in patients with SICD but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Streptococcal infections and polymicrobial cultures were risk factors for developing SICD. Higher rates of infections with Enterobacterales were seen in the SICD group but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: SICD patients had higher lactate, inflammation, and cardiac biomarkers levels upon admission and significantly higher rates of streptococcal infections and polymicrobial cultures."
41155423,Variation of Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory Factors in Severe Burns: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Burn injury triggers a complex inflammatory cascade in which the interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators determines recovery or progression to sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or multi-organ dysfunction, and mortality. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published between 2006 and 2024, identifying 1883 records. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After screening and eligibility assessment, 24 studies covering both pediatric and adult populations met the inclusion criteria. Data on cytokines, acute-phase proteins, complement fragments, and systemic inflammatory indices were synthesized narratively. The evidence indicates that the inflammatory response to burn injury is not a linear sequence of events but a dynamic and unstable equilibrium, where outcomes are determined less by the initial magnitude of cytokine release and more by the persistence of dysregulated inflammation or failure of compensatory mechanisms."
41155261,Prediction of Hyperinflammatory Phenotypes in Critically Ill Patients via Routine Clinical Data and IL-6: Towards Personalized Anti-Inflammatory Therapy.,2025,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a central mediator of systemic inflammation and is markedly elevated in critical illnesses, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hyperinflammatory syndromes. Patient responses to immunomodulatory therapies vary, highlighting the need to better understand IL-6 regulation and its clinical implications. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit in a quaternary academic center with a comprehensive cancer program, extracting clinical and laboratory data, including inflammatory markers and plasma IL-6 levels. Plasma IL-6 concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Survival analyses, multivariable adaptive Lasso regression, Bayesian logistic regression, and latent class analysis were performed to define determinants of IL-6 regulation, mortality, and inflammatory phenotypes. IL-6 levels were substantially elevated in sepsis (median 1150 pg/mL) and neutropenia (median 7866 pg/mL), with extreme concentrations exceeding 20,000 pg/mL when both were present. Although IL-6 across its full range was not independently predictive of intensive care unit mortality, dichotomized thresholds (>/=200 pg/mL) correlated with lower survival. Advanced modeling defined a hyperinflammatory phenotype characterized by IL-6 >/= 100 pg/mL and predicted mortality >40%, showing mortality of 58%, alongside distinct latent subgroups with heterogeneous inflammatory activity and outcomes. These results emphasize the prominent role of sepsis and neutropenia in driving IL-6 elevations and reveal inflammatory phenotypes with potential for risk stratification and targeted anti-cytokine therapy in critical illness."
41155249,Precision Profiling of Disease Progression in Murine Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock.,2025,"Septic shock has an unacceptably high mortality rate and unmet need for new therapeutics. Murine models are crucial for research, yet methodologies often differ. This study characterised standard- and high-grade caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine models of septic shock by integrating ultraminiature arterial telemetry with comprehensive plasma biomarker analysis. Standard-grade and high-grade CLP was performed in 8-10 week old, male C57BL/6 mice (n = 98), with a subset implanted with arterial telemetry to monitor real-time circulatory function. Plasma markers of inflammation and organ damage were measured at multiple intervals up to 168 h post-CLP. Standard-grade and high-grade CLP showed distinct progressions; episodes of hypotension began 5-6 h after CLP in 30% of standard-grade and all high-grade CLP mice, with respective 168 h mortality of 40% and 71%. Recurrent episodes of hypotension 5-39 h after CLP were universally lethal. The coincidence of hypotension and elevated plasma lactate defined the onset of septic shock after high-grade CLP, which was always lethal. Inflammatory cytokines and markers of liver, renal, and cardiac damage were markedly elevated to 168 h after high-grade CLP, in contrast to standard-grade CLP, which returned to baseline by 48 h. Elevated plasma IL-6, TNFalpha, and corticosterone, along with reduced albumin, were significantly correlated with mortality. In conclusion, this research refines murine CLP models by providing a precise, dynamic map of the progression to septic shock. The high-grade CLP model consistently models early and late-stage physiological deterioration and serves as a robust model for evaluating the efficacy of novel therapies aimed at human septic shock."
41154281,Endotoxin Activity Assay-Guided Patient Selection for Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion: Lessons from the TIGRIS Trial and Future Directions.,2025,"Sepsis and septic shock remain leading global causes of mortality, with endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria playing a central role in their pathophysiology. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) was developed as an adjunctive therapy to directly remove circulating endotoxin in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Early clinical trials yielded conflicting results, largely due to challenges in patient selection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) has been investigated as a biomarker to identify patients most likely to benefit, but its limitations include indirect measurement, variability, and poor specificity. The recently completed TIGRIS trial, which enrolled septic shock patients with intermediate EAA values (0.60-0.89) and high organ dysfunction, demonstrated a significant survival benefit, thereby validating a targeted, precision medicine approach. This review critically appraises the role of EAA in guiding PMX-HP, highlights the lessons learned from the TIGRIS trial, and discusses complementary strategies such as integrating additional biomarkers, organ dysfunction scoring, and clinical phenotyping. Future research should embed EAA within multi-dimensional frameworks to optimize patient selection and establish PMX-HP as a precision therapy for endotoxemic sepsis and septic shock."
41154232,Healthcare 5.0-Driven Clinical Intelligence: The Learn-Predict-Monitor-Detect-Correct Framework for Systematic Artificial Intelligence Integration in Critical Care.,2025,"Background: Healthcare 5.0 represents a shift toward intelligent, human-centric care systems. Intensive care units generate vast amounts of data that require real-time decisions, but current decision support systems lack comprehensive frameworks for safe integration of artificial intelligence. Objective: We developed and validated the Learn-Predict-Monitor-Detect-Correct (LPMDC) framework as a methodology for systematic artificial intelligence integration across the critical care workflow. The framework improves predictive analytics, continuous patient monitoring, intelligent alerting, and therapeutic decision support while maintaining essential human clinical oversight. Methods: Framework development employed systematic theoretical modeling integrating Healthcare 5.0 principles, comprehensive literature synthesis covering 2020-2024, clinical workflow analysis across 15 international ICU sites, technology assessment of mature and emerging AI applications, and multi-round expert validation by 24 intensive care physicians and medical informaticists. Each LPMDC phase was designed with specific integration requirements, performance metrics, and safety protocols. Results: LPMDC implementation and aggregated evidence from prior studies demonstrated significant clinical improvements: 30% mortality reduction, 18% ICU length-of-stay decrease (7.5 to 6.1 days), 45% clinician cognitive load reduction, and 85% sepsis bundle compliance improvement. Machine learning algorithms achieved an 80% sensitivity for sepsis prediction three hours before clinical onset, with false-positive rates below 15%. Additional applications demonstrated effectiveness in predicting respiratory failure, preventing cardiovascular crises, and automating ventilator management. Digital twins technology enabled personalized treatment simulations, while the integration of the Internet of Medical Things provided comprehensive patient and environmental surveillance. Implementation challenges were systematically addressed through phased deployment strategies, staff training programs, and regulatory compliance frameworks. Conclusions: The Healthcare 5.0-enabled LPMDC framework provides the first comprehensive theoretical foundation for systematic AI integration in critical care while preserving human oversight and clinical safety. The cyclical five-phase architecture enables processing beyond traditional cognitive limits through continuous feedback loops and system optimization. Clinical validation demonstrates measurable improvements in patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and clinician satisfaction. Future developments incorporating quantum computing, federated learning, and explainable AI technologies offer additional advancement opportunities for next-generation critical care systems."
41153844,"Clinical and Therapeutic Insights into Sepsis: A Retrospective Observational Study of Inflammatory Markers, and Outcomes.",2025,"Introduction: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by dysregulated host responses to infection, leading to organ failure and high mortality. Early recognition, especially in vulnerable populations, remains challenging due to variable presentations. Key biomarkers like CRP, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) aid in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis. Rapid identification and targeted therapy are critical, particularly amid rising antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to analyze the relationship between early biomarker levels and patient outcomes, focusing on mortality risk prediction within the first week of hospitalization. Methods: A retrospective study of 198 sepsis patients hospitalized in Bucharest, Romania, between January and December 2024, analyzing inflammatory biomarkers at admission-T0, 48-72 h-T1, and one week-T2, to identify predictors of clinical outcomes. Results: In patients under 65 years old, fibrinogen, CRP, and NLR significantly decreased from T0 to T2, especially in survivors. In contrast, patients over 65 years old showed less consistent biomarker changes, with higher mortality associated, with comorbidities such as heart failure and cancer. Overall, early reductions in inflammatory markers correlated with better outcomes, highlighting their prognostic value in sepsis management. Conclusions: In sepsis patients over 65 years old, a stable or rising neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and fibrinogen levels after the first week of hospitalization may indicate a poor prognosis, whereas decreasing levels suggest a better chance of survival."
41153807,"Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Infectious Diseases in Older Adults: Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Applications.",2025,"Background: Older adults are highly vulnerable to infectious diseases due to immunosenescence, multimorbidity, and atypical presentations. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising opportunities to improve diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and continuity of care in this population. This review summarizes current applications of AI in the management of infections in older adults across diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and preventive domains. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed studies retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on AI-based tools for infection diagnosis, risk prediction, antimicrobial stewardship, prevention of healthcare-associated infections, and post-discharge care in individuals aged >/=65 years. Results: AI models, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques, have demonstrated high performance in detecting infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, and healthcare-associated infections (Area Under the Curve AUC up to 0.98). Prognostic algorithms integrating frailty and functional status enhance the prediction of mortality, complications, and readmission. AI-driven clinical decision support systems contribute to optimized antimicrobial therapy and timely interventions, while remote monitoring and telemedicine applications support safer hospital-to-home transitions and reduced 30-day readmissions. However, the implementation of these technologies is limited by the underrepresentation of frail older adults in training datasets, lack of real-world validation in geriatric settings, and the insufficient explainability of many models. Additional barriers include system interoperability issues and variable digital infrastructure, particularly in long-term care and community settings. Conclusions: AI has strong potential to support predictive and personalized infection management in older adults. Future research should focus on developing geriatric-specific, interpretable models, improving system integration, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure safe and equitable implementation."
41153764,"sTREM-1, HMGB1, CRP, PCT, sCD14-ST, IL-6, IL-10, sHLA-G, and Vitamin D in Relation to Clinical Scores and Survival in SIRS/Sepsis.",2025,"Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and remains a major cause of mortality in intensive care units. Methods: We analyzed plasma levels of sTREM-1, CRP, PCT, sCD14-ST, HMGB1, IL-6, IL-10, vitamin D (VD), and sHLA-G in patients with SIRS/sepsis, and assessed their relationships with APACHE II, SOFA scores, and survival. Results: Septic patients showed significantly elevated sTREM-1, CRP, PCT, sCD14-ST, and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, while VD levels were markedly reduced. Logistic regression identified CRP and PCT as the strongest univariate predictors of sepsis, but after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, CRP lost significance, whereas VD and sCD14-ST remained independent predictors. Prognostically, higher IL-10 levels significantly correlated with 7- and 28-day mortality and with SOFA scores, while higher VD concentrations predicted better survival. Conclusion: CRP, PCT, and sCD14-ST are reliable diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis, with sTREM-1 providing additional value for disease monitoring. After adjustment for clinical covariates, VD emerged as an independent protective factor, whereas elevated IL-10 significantly predicted 7- and 28-day mortality. These findings underscore the utility of combining inflammatory and immunoregulatory biomarkers to improve sepsis diagnostics and prognostication, warranting validation in larger multicenter cohorts."
41153763,The Involvement of Endothelin-1 in Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction-A Novel Biomarker in Patient Assessment.,2025,"Sepsis represents a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and is considered a medical emergency. Therefore, quick diagnosis and treatment are required in order to improve survivability. Currently, patient evaluation in sepsis is based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to determine the severity of the disease; however, novel biomarkers are also actively researched with the aim to develop quicker diagnostic tools and better therapy. Endothelin-1 is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors found in the human body and is involved in the pathophysiology of both sepsis and other conditions involving organs that make up the SOFA score. In this narrative review, we aimed to gather information of this peptide's multiple effects and to help determine whether or not it could prove a valuable biomarker in the evaluation of patients with multi-organ dysfunction in sepsis."
41153671,Immune Dysregulation in Sepsis. A Narrative Review for the Clinicians.,2025,"Immune dysregulation presents a significant clinical challenge due to its rapid progression and complex interplay between hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses. Different responses from the innate and adaptive immune systems can result in diseases such as immunoparalysis, cytokine storms, and secondary infections. Current diagnostic methods remain non-specific and time-consuming, delaying targeted interventions. A compartmentalized approach to immune monitoring, distinguishing innate and acquired immune response functional differentiation, is essential for distinguishing between hyperactivation and suppression. Key biomarkers, including cytokines, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), and CD4/CD8 counts, as well as Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PDL-1) and V-type immunoglobulin domain-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) regulators, can guide personalized treatment strategies. Although they need more clinical validation, novel therapeutic methods such as cytokine inhibitors, immunological stimulants, and immunomodulators have demonstrated promise. Early diagnosis and precision medicine developments could lead to better patient outcomes. Advances in non-coding RNAs have led to specific diagnostic panels based on microRNA (MiRNA) levels. A deeper understanding of immune imbalance in sepsis is critical for optimizing treatment and reducing mortality rates. This review highlights emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to address the multifaceted nature of sepsis-related immune dysregulation."
41153617,Beyond Acute Coronary Syndromes: Troponins as Diagnostic and Prognostic Tools in Heart Failure.,2025,"Heart failure (HF) is a challenging syndrome, affecting 64 million people worldwide, and is associated with high mortality rates. There are several potential biomarkers that help us diagnose the disease as well as help us assess the prognosis. Cardiac troponins I and T are effective tools for predicting poor outcomes in HF. Cardiac troponins are intracellular proteins responsible for regulating and conducting muscle contractions. They indicate cardiomyocyte injury caused by ischemia, toxins, inflammation, wall stress, and other factors. Some of these injuries may be reversible. The blood level of troponins is influenced by various factors, both physiological-such as sex, age, and weight-and pathological, including microbiological organisms, autoantibody complexes, and conditions like pulmonary embolism, stroke, sepsis, or kidney disease. Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of troponin measurement in prognostication for patients with acute and chronic HF. However, it has been found that many patients with chronic heart failure have undetectable serum levels of cardiac troponins, leading to the adoption of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTn). Expanding this knowledge is crucial for enabling more intensive stratification and early identification of patients with poorer prognoses."
41153411,Non-Protein-Coding RNA and Acute Kidney Injury: New Developments from Pathogenesis to Potential Biomarker.,2025,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a critical medical condition characterized by a sudden and significant decline in renal function over a short timeframe. Commonly triggered by factors such as sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or nephrotoxic agents, AKI is linked to substantial rates of morbidity and mortality. In recent years, small non-coding RNAs have gained attention as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis and potential treatment of AKI. Among them, microRNAs (miRNAs)-short RNA sequences of 21-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression via sequence-specific binding-stand out due to their remarkable stability in biological fluids such as plasma and urine. Notably, certain miRNAs, including miR-21, miR-30, miR-494, and miR-29, have shown the ability to detect AKI earlier than traditional biomarkers like serum creatinine, offering the potential to enhance clinical decision-making. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent findings regarding the involvement of non-coding RNA, in particular microRNAs, in both the early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for AKI. By highlighting their potential as sensitive biomarkers and novel treatment targets, this review seeks to contribute to advancing clinical approaches that improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, a deeper understanding and utilization of microRNAs could lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and targeted therapies for AKI, helping to prevent progression to chronic kidney disease and reduce associated mortality rates. However, further clinical studies and translational applications are still needed to validate these findings and implement them in patient care."
41153306,Prognostic Value of Tryptophanyl-tRNA Synthetase in Sepsis Combined with Kidney Dysfunction or Urinary Tract Infection: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"Background: Although tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS) is a novel biomarker released during bacterial and viral infections, its prognostic value in sepsis has rarely been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic performance of WRS in patients with sepsis in the emergency department (ED). Methods: This prospective, observational study included 243 patients with sepsis. Blood samples were collected to measure full-length WRS levels. The prognostic value of WRS was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The WRS levels were higher in patients with septic shock than in those without shock (p = 0.018). WRS could predict 30-day mortality (area under the curve, 0.648; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.569-0.726; sensitivity, 56.7%; specificity, 73.3%; cut-off value, 84.15 microg/L; p < 0.001). Patients with WRS levels of >/=84.15 microg/L showed higher 30-day mortality than those with WRS levels of <84.15 microg/L. Among patients with WRS levels of >/=84.15 microg/L, those with positive urine culture results had higher 30-day mortality than those with negative urine culture. Patients with renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of >/=1 had higher 30-day mortality than those with renal SOFA score of 0. WRS was an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality (hazard ratio = 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; p = 0.014). Conclusions: WRS effectively predicted clinical outcome in patients with sepsis and could be more useful in those with kidney dysfunction or urinary tract infection."
41153245,Early Sepsis Detection in Adult Patients with Suspected Sepsis in an Emergency Setting: A Sequential Strategy of Monocyte Distribution Width and Presepsin.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Monocyte distribution width (MDW) is a US FDA-cleared early sepsis indicator for adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Presepsin, a soluble CD14 subtype, is another sepsis biomarker reflecting innate immune activation. We explored the clinical utility of sequential MDW and presepsin testing for early sepsis detection in the ED. Methods: In a total of 281 adult ED patients with suspected sepsis (including 128 patients with confirmed sepsis), MDW was measured on a DxH 900 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA), and presepsin level was measured using the HISCL Presepsin assay (Sysmex, Japan). Diagnostic performances of MDW, presepsin, and their combination (MDW followed by presepsin) were compared using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: MDW, presepsin, and their combination were comparable for diagnosing sepsis (AUC ranges: 0.52-0.65). Compared with MDW and presepsin, their combination increased diagnostic sensitivity (90.6%, 89.8%, and 98.4%, respectively). Moreover, the sequential strategy significantly reduced false-negative results compared to each biomarker (2 [1.6%] for the sequential strategy vs. 12 [9.4%] for MDW vs. 13 [10.2%] for presepsin, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with individual measurement of MDW and presepsin, the sequential strategy of MDW followed by presepsin would improve early sepsis detection in ED patients by significantly reducing false negatives. This approach would ensure timely and effective triage for ruling in septic patients, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes."
41152846,Biomarkers trajectories in critically ill patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: insights from latent class growth analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common condition requiring intensive care, with limited effective treatments due to its clinical and biological heterogeneity. Efforts in critical care medicine have identified ARDS sub-phenotypes, hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory, which suggest underlying heterogeneity in patient responses. Studies have detected a low prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype in ARDS patients related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To identify targeted therapeutic interventions, this study applied growth mixture models to longitudinal biomarker data to determine specific latent trajectory groups. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cohort study on patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to an Italian intensive care unit (ICU) with at least two assessments of inflammatory marker levels within 28 days of admission. Plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were analysed, with a total of 201 level assessments performed. None showed hyperinflammatory phenotype within 48 h of ICU admission. Latent class growth analysis identified distinct trajectories for sTNFR-1, ICAM-1, and sRAGE, with sTNFR-1 class 1 including 39.7% of patients showing elevated levels escalating during ICU stay. Compared to sTNFR-1 class 2, class 1 patients were older (63.8 +/- 14.7 versus 58.4 +/- 12.7, P = 0.0486), had higher baseline inflammatory marker levels (IL-6, IL-8, sRAGE, and sTNFR-1), higher proportions of prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy utilization, and a higher mortality rate (56.5% versus 28.6%, p = 0.0333). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19, we identified distinct latent trajectories based on longitudinal data of inflammatory markers. sTNFR-1 levels identified a subgroup with a hypoinflammatory phenotype, demonstrating a mortality rate comparable to that typically observed in ARDS hyperinflammatory phenotype. These findings point out the criticality of delineating distinct patient subgroups within the context of ARDS and COVID-19, enhancing clinical management and optimizing patient prognosis.

41148729,"URO-RESIST: A Real-World Retrospective Study on Multidrug-Resistant Sepsis with Urinary Tract Infection, Clinical Predictors, Inflammatory Biomarkers, and Patient Outcomes.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis with Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality, increasingly complicated by multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are key to improving outcomes and limiting antimicrobial resistance. The URO-RESIST study aimed to assess the relationship between clinical features, inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, CRP and PCT, respectively), microbiological profiles, and outcomes in patients with sepsis with UTI. A secondary aim was to compare microbiological patterns between institutionalized patients and those living at home without known MDR risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 231 patients with sepsis with UTI. admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Chieti Hospital, Italy, between 2014 and 2024 (excluding 2020-2021). Data on clinical, laboratory, and microbiological variables were collected. MDR organisms were defined per European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) criteria. Analyses included non-parametric tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: MDR pathogens were identified in over 40% of cases. Patients from long-term care facilities had higher CRP levels and a higher prevalence of MDR infections. Carbapenems were frequently used, though empirical treatment was sometimes inappropriate. PCT did not differ significantly between MDR and non-MDR groups and had limited prognostic value. CRP and MDR presence were both associated with worse outcomes and longer hospital stays. Functional dependence and dementia were strongly linked to MDR infections. Age correlated with comorbidities but was not an independent predictor of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: MDR infections worsen the course of sepsis with UTI. CRP may outperform PCT in assessing severity, especially in institutionalized patients. Functional and cognitive impairments increase vulnerability to MDR pathogens. These findings support the need for rapid diagnostics, targeted antibiotic use, and personalized care strategies."
41148534,Positive and unlabeled learning from hospital administrative data: a novel approach to identify sepsis cases.,2025,"In positive and unlabeled (PU) learning problems, only positive examples are labeled. Unlabeled data contain both positive and negative examples. Studies show that positive examples of (secondary) diagnoses, and clinical conditions, such as sepsis, are present in unlabeled hospital administrative data, potentially distorting hospital reimbursement systems, and negatively affecting hospitals' revenue and profitability. We investigate whether PU learning is suitable for improving the quality of hospital administrative data. We train three models on 313,434 hospital cases using hospital cost features: two based on the two-step ""spy"" approach and one using a robust PU learning method. For model evaluation, we rely exclusively on positive examples due to the PU setting. To further assess model performance, we perform an external validity check: We relabel unlabeled sepsis cases, derive new sepsis rates, and compare them to those reported in medical record review studies. All models identify true positives well in unseen data. External validity checks show, however, that only the robust PU learner effectively discriminates between positives and negatives in the unlabeled data, yielding new sepsis rates within the range of sepsis rates reported in medical record review studies. PU learning can improve the quality of hospital administrative data, but its effectiveness depends strongly on the choice of learning approach and classifier. The output of a PU learner can potentially improve hospital reimbursement systems, hospital revenue and profitability management, and sensitivity analyses in healthcare management science, health economics, health services research, and disease surveillance."
41146542,[Proteomics reveals biomarkers for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective multicenter cohort study].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To identify and validate novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and precise continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using proteomics. METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. Patients with sepsis admitted to five hospitals in Taizhou City of Zhejiang Province from April 2019 to December 2021 were continuously enrolled, based on the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Sepsis patients were divided into SA-AKI group and non-SA-AKI group, and healthy individuals who underwent physical examinations during the same period were used as control (NC group). Peripheral blood samples from participants were collected for protein mass spectrometry analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified, and functional enrichment analysis was conducted on these proteins. The levels of target proteins were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the predictive value of target protein for SA-AKI were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve). Additionally, sepsis patients and healthy individuals were selected from one hospital to externally verify the expression level of the target protein and its predictive value for SA-AKI, as well as the accuracy of CRRT treatment. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients with sepsis (including 19 with AKI and 18 without AKI) and 31 healthy individuals were enrolled for proteomic analysis. Seven proteins were identified with significantly differential expression between the SA-AKI group and non-SA-AKI group: namely cystatin C (CST3), beta (2)-microglobulin (beta (2)M), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), complement factor I (CFI), complement factor D (CFD), CD59, and glycoprotein prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in immune response, complement activation, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil degranulation. ELISA results demonstrated specific expression of each target protein in the SA-AKI group. Additionally, 65 patients with sepsis (38 with AKI and 27 without AKI) and 20 healthy individuals were selected for external validation of the 7 target proteins. ELISA results showed that there were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of CST3, beta (2)M, IGFBP4, CFD, and CD59 between the SA-AKI group and non-SA-AKI group. ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) values of CST3, beta (2)M, IGFBP4, CFD, and CD59 for predicting SA-AKI were 0.788, 0.723, 0.723, 0.795, and 0.836, respectively, all exceeding 0.7. Further analysis of patients who underwent CRRT or not revealed that IGFBP4 had a good predictive value, with an AUC of 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: Based on proteomic analysis, CST3, beta (2)M, IGFBP4, CFD, and CD59 may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of SA-AKI, among which IGFBP4 might be a potential biomarker for predicting the need for CRRT in SA-AKI patients. However, further clinical validation is required."
41146513,[Research progress in clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy].,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common complication of sepsis, referring to a diffuse brain dysfunction caused by sepsis in the absence of direct central nervous system (CNS) infection. SAE occurs in up to 70% of patients with sepsis. Globally, the annual incidence of sepsis ranges from 30.0 to 48.9 million cases, resulting in approximately 11 million deaths per year, which accounts for 20% of all global mortalities. SAE is identified as an independent risk factor contributing to the increased mortality rate among these patients. Early diagnosis of SAE and related cerebral protection interventions hold significant clinical importance. Currently, the main indicators of brain function for sepsis patients include Glasgow coma score (GCS), confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU), electroencephalogram (EEG), brain CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other related imaging changes, which have the problems of low sensitivity, poor specificity, and non-objective evaluation of the results of the diagnosis of SAE. This article focuses on the latest progress in the pathogenesis of SAE and systematically reviews potential biomarkers related to the onset of SAE from multiple aspects, including inflammatory markers, endothelial and neuronal injury markers, and metabolic markers. This will provide new insights for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of SAE."
41146232,High-density lipoprotein: a biomarker and therapeutic target in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that stems from a dysregulated host response to an infection, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and death. Sepsis has a remarkably high global burden and accounts for 20% of all deaths worldwide. Nonetheless, possibilities for treatment are limited mainly to early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and providing fluid resuscitation. Innovative strategies that target the excessive inflammatory response while supporting the immune system to clear the infection are highly warranted. It is well-established that sepsis significantly impacts lipoprotein metabolism, leading to a substantial decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as observed in both experimental and clinical studies. Meanwhile, a high HDL level is associated with better sepsis-related prognosis, indicating that strategies aimed at raising HDL could be beneficial in combating sepsis. In this review, we describe changes in lipoprotein metabolism that occur during sepsis, address the various protective functions of HDL based on its endotoxin-neutralizing, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties, as well as demonstrate modulation of HDL as a potential therapeutic strategy in sepsis.

41146169,"Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF1alpha), Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+, NADH), and Nitric Oxide (NO) interplay in critically ill patients, with implications for patient safety and targeted therapies: a review.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Critical illnesses such as sepsis, trauma, and multi-organ failure initiate complex molecular cascades that disrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to poor outcomes. Key among these mediators are Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH), Nitric Oxide (NO), and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF1alpha), each playing crucial roles in redox regulation, immune modulation, and tissue adaptation to hypoxia. REVIEW: This review examines the individual and interrelated roles of NAD+, NO, and HIF1alpha in critically ill patients. We explore how imbalances in NAD+/NADH ratio impair mitochondrial metabolism, how dysregulated NO signaling alters vascular tone and immune responses, and how HIF1alpha stabilization governs transcriptional programs under hypoxia. By mapping the biochemical crosstalk among these molecules, we identify potential feedback loops that influence inflammation, cellular energetics, and patient outcomes. A central theme is the safety and therapeutic relevance of modulating these mediators, with specific focus on the timing, context, and molecular profile of patients in critical care. CONCLUSION: Understanding the dynamic interplay among NAD+, NO, and HIF1alpha offers new opportunities for precision medicine in critical illness. We propose a hypothesis that phase-specific modulation of these pathways-through NAD+ precursors, NO donors/scavengers, or HIF1alpha stabilizers-could improve outcomes if guided by real-time molecular profiling. Prioritizing patient safety through targeted, biomarker-informed interventions may prevent progression to multi-organ failure and enable more personalized and effective treatments."
41145479,Hmox1 expression indicates distinct injury phenotypes of proximal tubule cells in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI) is the most common organ dysfunction in sepsis and a significant contributor to high mortality rates. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying pathogenesis of SAKI remains unclear, and effective therapies are currently lacking. This study aims to identify specific biomarkers for SAKI diagnosis by integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from renal tissues in the SAKI model. We analyzed changes in mRNA/protein expression and cellular localization in kidney tissues affected by SAKI and confirmed that Hmox1 has potential as an indicator of proximal tubule (PT) injury in SAKI. Further validation across mouse models, and patient samples confirmed the role of Hmox1 in SAKI. Notably, we observed that Hmox1 high- and low-expressing PT cell subsets exhibit distinct phenotypes in SAKI. The Hmox1(hi) PT cells are the principal cells undergoing injury and metabolic alterations, while Hmox1(low) PT cells exert a major pro-inflammatory role through interactions with macrophages."
41145063,Association of the soluble form of the endothelial Tie2 receptor with organ failure and mortality in patients with sepsis and ARDS.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Tie2 is an endothelial surface receptor critically involved in angiogenesis, cell-integrity, and survival. During inflammatory disorders such as sepsis and ARDS, the receptor is shed from the endothelial surface, contributing to a reduction of its protective downstream signaling ultimately contributing to endothelial permeability and thereby capillary leakage. This study investigates the association of the soluble form of Tie2 (sTie2), with multiorgan failure, requirement of dialysis and mortality. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a biomarker study using serum samples from sepsis and/or ARDS patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of Hannover Medical School. sTie2 was quantified by Multiplex Luminex Assay in serum samples collected on the day of ICU admission. Correlations between sTie2 levels and baseline SOFA-score, duration of vasopressor therapy, and duration of mechanical ventilation were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compare sTie2 levels between individuals with and without renal replacement therapy, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. Cox regression models were applied to assess the independent association of sTie2 with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: sTie2 levels showed an inverse correlation with the SOFA-score (R = -0.2, p = 0.003) and were lower in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (17.4 [12.25-22.48] vs. 21.35 [14.91-29.08] ng/ml, p = 0.003) and in non-survivors (14.54 [10.96-15.02] vs. 21.01 [15-28.12] ng/ml, p < 0.001). No correlation was found between sTie2 and the number of days requiring vasopressor therapy or mechanical ventilation. Using multivariable cox regression, sTie2 was independently associated with mortality at 28-days (sTie2, log(ng/ml) - HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.57, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study of severely ill ICU patients, sTie2 was inversely related to severity of disease and to outcome. If the decrease in sTie2 is adaptive or maladaptive remains unclear but future investigations are required analysing the exact pathophysiological role of sTie2 to evaluate the biomarker as a potential target for the treatment of capillary leakage in patients with sepsis and/or ARDS."
41145017,Effect of ultrashort-acting beta-blocker on the mortality of patients with sepsis or septic shock: A systematic review and trial sequential meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Adrenergic responses, particularly tachycardia, play a role in sepsis-related complications. Ultrashort-acting beta-blockers have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for their impact on sepsis outcomes, but conflicting results have been reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide an updated perspective on the impact of ultrashort-acting beta-blockers on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from inception to January 12, 2024. RCTs investigating the clinical effects and safety of ultrashort-acting beta-blockers in sepsis or septic shock were included. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to evaluate the reliability of cumulative evidence. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 2253 patients involved in 27 RCTs were included. Ultrashort-acting beta-blockers significantly reduced the 28-day mortality rate (31.6% versus 48.4%; risk ratio [RR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.56-0.78). TSA provided robust evidence for the 28-day and in-hospital mortality benefit. The survival benefit remains evident in subgroups of patients with septic tachycardia (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.93), septic cardiomyopathy (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83), Chinese populations (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.76), and those treated with esmolol (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56-0.73). For patients with septic shock, only those with tachycardia demonstrated a statistically significant difference in mortality rates (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant ultrashort-acting beta-blocker therapy demonstrated potential benefits in improving survival for patients with sepsis or septic shock. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the potential benefits of adjuvant ultrashort-acting beta-blocker therapy for the treatment of sepsis or septic shock in terms of enhanced survival and other clinical advantages, including reduced heart rate and cardiovascular biomarkers. Furthermore, such therapy did not appear to impair cardiac function and hemodynamic stability."
41144909,Development of an Explainable Machine Learning Model to Predict Mortality Risk in Sepsis Patients: insights from a real-world clinical data.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a severe systemic inflammatory response, typically triggered by infection. When the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated, it can result in organ dysfunction, tissue damage, and even death. Sepsis can affect people of all ages, but older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic illnesses are at greater risk. Timely diagnosis and immediate intervention are essential to enhance the chances of survival. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a mortality risk prediction model for sepsis patients utilizing tree-based ensemble classifiers, with post-hoc interpretation through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to support clinical decision-making. METHODS: Clinical data of sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were collected. The mice package was used to handle missing data, and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) algorithm was applied to oversample the minority class to address data imbalance. We applied seven models, including Random Forest(RF), k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic_Lasso Regression (Logistic_Lasso), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and compared their prediction performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Precision-Recall Curve (PR), and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Based on these models, we applied both global and local interpretation approaches to elucidate model predictions and explore prognostic risk factors in sepsis patients. RESULTS: The RF model showed the best performance among the seven Machine Learning (ML) models, achieving an AUC of 0.9816. Both global and local explainability techniques were applied to interpret the decision-making mechanisms of the ML models. CONCLUSION: Local explanation methods can interpret how ML models make predictions for individual outcomes. Global interpretation techniques help reveal how ML models respond across the entire feature landscape."
41143611,"The Relationship between Thioredoxin-2, Systemic Immune-inflammatory Index, and Short-term Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Septic Cardiomyopathy.",2025,"To explore the relationship between thioredoxins (Trx) -2, systemic-immune inflammatory index (SII), and short-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in septic cardiomyopathy (SCM). A retrospective study was conducted on 98 SCM patients admitted to Affiliated Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) from July 2022 to June 2024. Patients underwent routine blood tests and data assessment upon admission. Based on the occurrence of MACE by day 28, patients were divided into the MACE group and the non-MACE (N-MACE) group. Clinical data were collected, and logistic regression, along with restricted cubic spline models, analyzed the relationships between SII, Trx-2, and MACE risk in SCM patients. Among the 98 SCM patients included, there were 35 (35.71%) in the MACE group and 63 (64.29%) in the N-MACE group. Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated SII and serum Trx-2 levels correlated with an increased risk of MACE within 28 days post-admission for SCM patients. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a linear dose-response relationship between both SII and Trx-2 levels with short-term MACE risk in SCM. The ROC curve showed AUC values of 0.869 for LVEF, 0.881 for SII, while combining SII + Trx-2 yielded 0.926 (95% CI: 0.862-0.989), with specificity at 83.98 % and sensitivity at 98.80%. The abnormal increase of serum SII and Trx-2 levels in SCM patients is related to the occurrence of MACE within 28 days after admission. The risk of MACE increases with the increase of serum SII and Trx-2 levels."
41142807,Integrated bioinformatics and molecular docking analysis reveal potential hub genes and targeted therapeutics in sepsis-associated acute lung injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (SA-ALI) is a severe complication of sepsis with high mortality. This study aimed to identify key diagnostic genes and potential therapeutic drugs for SA-ALI. METHODS: Transcriptomic data from GSE10474 and GSE32707 were integrated for differential expression and WGCNA analysis. Hub genes were screened using PPI network construction and three machine learning algorithms, and validated by Western blot. Functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction (DSigDB) were performed, followed by molecular docking. RESULTS: Six hub genes (PGM3, GDF15, GART, GFOD2, E2F2, ATP1B2) were identified and validated with elevated expression in SA-ALI. These genes were enriched in inflammation, immune regulation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling pathways, and showed significant correlations with specific immune cell subsets. Five candidate small molecules were predicted; molecular docking revealed Celastrol had the strongest binding to all six proteins, particularly GDF15 (-9.988 kcal/mol), while Thiostrepton showed strong binding to PGM3, GFOD2, and GDF15. CONCLUSION: Six diagnostic hub genes and two priority candidate drugs, Celastrol and Thiostrepton, were identified for SA-ALI, providing potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
41142406,Use of artificial intelligence in predicting in-hospital cardiac and respiratory arrest in an acute care environment-implications for clinical practice.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can augment clinical decision-making, including prediction, diagnosis, and treatment, in all aspects of medicine. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The current systematic review aims to provide a summary of existing data about the role of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and respiratory arrest. METHODS: The study was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science without any restriction were searched to extract relevant manuscripts until October 20, 2023. Additionally, the reference list of all potential studies was searched to identify further relevant articles. Original publications were regarded as eligible if they only recruited adult patients (>/=18 years of age), employed AI/ML algorithms for predicting cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and respiratory arrest in the setting of critical care, used data gathered from wards with critically ill patients (ICUs, cardiac ICUs, and emergency departments), and were published in English. The following information was extracted: first author, journal, ward, sample size, performance and features of ML and conventional models, and outcomes. RESULTS: ML algorithms have been used for cardiac arrest prediction using easily obtained variables as inputs. ML algorithms showed promising results (AUC 0.73-0.96) in predicting cardiac arrest in different settings, including critically ill ICU patients, patients in the emergency department and patients with sepsis, they demonstrated variable performance (AUC 0.54-0.94) in predicting respiratory arrest in COVID-19 patients, as well as other clinical settings. CONCLUSION: ML algorithms have shown promising results in predicting in-hospital cardiac and respiratory arrest using readily available clinical data. These algorithms may enhance early identification of high risk patients and support timely interventions, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity rates. However, the prospective validation of these algorithms and their integration into clinical workflows need further exploration."
41142133,Targeting proBDNF in neutrophil subsets: Sepsis biomarker discovery and insights into mitochondrial hyperactivation.,2025,"Sepsis, characterized by dysregulated immune responses, necessitates biomarkers and therapies. We conducted a prospective multicentric observational study involving sepsis patients and control groups. The proportions and brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (proBDNF) expression of blood neutrophil subsets were detected, and their clinical value was evaluated via correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. ProBDNF was significantly upregulated in immature neutrophils (CD16(int) Neu) in sepsis patients and slightly elevated in mature Neu (CD16(hi) Neu). ProBDNF expression in CD16(int) Neu showed promising diagnostic value for sepsis, with a specific positive correlation with disease severity, prognosis, and organ dysfunction. CD16(hi) Neu from sepsis patients presented hyperactivated mitochondria, as shown by their increased mitochondrial membrane potential and length, which was reversed by neutralizing proBDNF. ProBDNF expression in circulating CD16(int) Neu may be a promising biomarker of sepsis. Targeting proBDNF in CD16(hi) Neu has the potential to control mitochondrial hyperactivation during sepsis."
41142005,Accurate prediction of sepsis from pediatric emergency department to PICU using a machine-learning model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Timely identification of pediatric sepsis remains a critical challenge in emergency and intensive care settings due to the heterogeneous clinical presentations across age groups. Existing scoring systems often lack temporal resolution and interpretability. We aimed to develop a real-time, machine learning-based prediction framework integrating static and dynamic electronic health record (EHR) features to support early sepsis detection. METHODS: This retrospective study included pediatric patients from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (GWCMC; n = 1,697) and an external validation cohort from the MIMIC-III database (n = 827). Irregular time-series data were imputed using a correlation-enhanced continuous time-window histogram with multivariate Gaussian processes (CTWH + MGP). We compared the predictive performance of XGBoost and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based RNN models over a 12-h window prior to clinical diagnosis. Model outputs were validated internally and externally using AUROC, AUPRC, and Youden index, with SHAP-based interpretability applied to identify key clinical features. RESULTS: The CTWH + MGP-XGBoost model achieved the highest AUROC at diagnosis time (T = 0 h; AUROC = 0.915), while the GRU-based model demonstrated superior temporal stability across early windows. Top contributing features included lactate, white blood cell count, pH, and vasopressor use. External validation confirmed generalizability (MIMIC-III AUROC = 0.905). Simulation of real-time alerts showed a median lead time of 6.2 h before clinical diagnosis, with kappa = 0.82 agreement against physician-confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a dual-model ensemble combining interpolation-based preprocessing and interpretable machine learning enables robust early sepsis detection in pediatric populations. The system supports integration into EHR platforms for real-time clinical alerts and may inform prospective trials and quality improvement initiatives."
41140695,Is dexmedetomidine superior to non-dexmedetomidine sedatives (particularly propofol) for sedation in critically ill patients with septic shock? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and propofol (PROP) are both recommended as first-line short-acting sedative-analgesic agents for sepsis patients. However, existing studies have reported inconsistent clinical outcomes potentially attributable to their distinct hemodynamic profiles. The aim of our study was to systematically evaluate the comparative clinical efficacy and safety of DEX vs. non-Dexmedetomidine sedatives (particularly Propofol) in patients with septic shock. METHODS: The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024626139). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting eligibility criteria were systematically searched up to December 2024. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was employed to determine the required sample size. RESULTS: 17 RCTs were enrolled with 1,422 patients. Compared with non-DEX group, DEX group presented significantly reduced 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.94, p = 0.02), lower IL-6 (mean difference [MD] -3.11 ng/L, 95% CI -5.32 to -0.90, p = 0.006) and TNF-alpha (MD -0.21 ng/L, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.12, p < 0.001). Importantly, the incidence of adverse effects did not increase compared to non-DEX groups, as evidenced by delirium (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.97, p = 0.66), bradycardia (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.78, p = 0.40), and hypotension (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.19, p = 0.46). In the subgroup analysis, PROP showed no significant differences over DEX for key clinical outcomes, including: 28-day mortality and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU LOS), etc. Regrettably, existing RCTs lacked sufficient data regarding inflammatory biomarkers and adverse event profiles above in direct comparisons between DEX and PROP. TSA on 28-day mortality between DEX and PROP indicated that a minimum of 1,269 additional participants would have required to achieve conclusive evidence (alpha = 0.10; beta = 0.30; relative risk reduction [RRR] = 12.5%). CONCLUSION: DEX demonstrated superiority over non-DEX sedatives in critically ill patients with septic shock without increasing hemodynamic adverse events. However, current evidence showed no significant differences between DEX and PROP, warranting further high-quality RCTs for definitive conclusions."
41140665,Is calprotectin a reliable marker in surgical ICU settings? A clinical evaluation of its role in sepsis and mortality prediction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Calprotectin, a neutrophil-derived protein, has emerged as a potential biomarker for inflammation and infection. This study evaluated the utility of serum calprotectin levels in diagnosing sepsis and predicting mortality in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 124 patients admitted to the surgical ICU at Usak Training and Research Hospital between 2022 and 2024. Data on demographics, serum calprotectin, CRP, PCT, lactate levels, and clinical scores (SOFA, APACHE II) were collected. ROC analysis was used for predictive accuracy; Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients assessed associations. RESULTS: No significant associations were found between serum calprotectin and SOFA/APACHE II scores, CRP, or lactate. However, calprotectin correlated positively with PCT in sepsis (r = 0.428, p = 0.002) negatively in postoperative subgroups (r = -0.48, p < 0.001). Calprotectin showed poor prognostic accuracy (AUC = 0.472). Mortality was significantly associated with high CRP and severity scores, but not with calprotectin levels. CONCLUSION: Calprotectin alone lacks sufficient diagnostic or prognostic power for sepsis in surgical ICU patients. It may serve as a complementary marker alongside PCT in specific subgroups."
41140320,Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Respiratory Failure in Patients With Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury (SA-AKI) Within 48 Hours of Admission.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To identify patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) at high risk of respiratory failure within 48 h of admission and enable timely intervention to improve patient prognosis. METHODS: Data from SA-AKI patients admitted to Dongyang People's Hospital between June 2012 and October 2024 were collected, including gender, age, and blood biochemical indicators at admission. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation groups. Independent risk factors for respiratory failure were identified in the training group, and a nomogram prediction model was developed. The model's discriminative ability was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and its calibration was evaluated using the GiViTi calibration plot. Clinical effectiveness was examined using decision curve analysis (DCA). Cross-validation was performed to test the model's stability using kappa value. The model was subsequently validated in the validation group. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)-based, National Early Warning Score (NEWS)-based, and various other machine learning models were also established and compared with the proposed model using DeLong's test after Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: A total of 702 patients were included in the study. Independent risk factors for respiratory failure included D-dimer, lactate, pro-BNP, albumin, globulin, transcutaneous blood oxygen saturation, and pulmonary infection. The AUC values for the training and validation groups were 0.818 and 0.795, respectively, with calibration plot p values of 0.973 and 0.864. The DCA curves for both groups indicated superior clinical utility compared with extreme scenarios. This model owned a kappa value of 0.628, indicating for good stability. The SOFA model achieved AUC values of 0.583 (training group) and 0.763 (validation group), while the NEWS model had AUC values of 0.628 (training) and 0.618 (validation). DeLong's test confirmed that the proposed model outperformed SOFA and NEWS models (p < 0.05). In the validation group, the AUC values for SVM, C5.0, XGBoost, and integrated models were 0.781, 0.757, 0.759, and 0.778, respectively, with comparable discriminative ability to the nomogram (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study based on D-dimer, lactate, pro-BNP, albumin, globulin, transcutaneous blood oxygen saturation, and pulmonary infection was found to effectively predict respiratory failure risk in SA-AKI patients within 48 h of admission."
41139765,Development of a gene panel for immune status assessment in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, with a balance between hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, which determines the patient's immune status. Real-time monitoring of the immune status in sepsis is crucial for guiding immunotherapy. However, reliable biomarkers are lacking. This study aims to identify a panel of biomarkers for rapid bedside assessment of immune status in sepsis to guide immunotherapy decisions. RESULTS: TBX21, GNLY, PRF1, and IL2RB represent the immune status in sepsis. These genes demonstrated discriminatory power in the external validation, with area under the curve values ranging from 0.891 to 0.909 across several machine learning models. 99 double-blind randomized patients with sepsis were clustered into two endotypes on the basis of the expression of the four-gene panel. Higher 90-day mortality was observed in patients with sepsis treated with hydrocortisone (Odds ratio 12.46, 95% confidence intervals 3.11 to 65.72) or thymosin (Odds ratio 4.17, 95% confidence intervals 1.13 to 16.51) within the high-expression 4-gene panel endotype, but not in another endotype. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the potential utility of a four-gene panel to assess immune status and guide immunotherapy; further prospective validation and translational studies are warranted.

41138937,Targeting gut microbiotasu-derived butyrate for Ferroptosis inhibition in Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a critical complication of sepsis, and ferroptosis has been identified as a key contributor to its pathogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that sepsis profoundly disrupts the gut microbiota composition, leading to dysbiosis. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut microbiota, has been implicated in ferroptosis regulation; however, its role in SIMD remains controversial. This study aims to elucidate the protective effects of gut microbiota-derived butyrate against SIMD through ferroptosis modulation. METHODS: This study assessed cardiac function using echocardiography and quantified myocardial injury biomarkers via ELISA. Myocardial iron deposition was evaluated using Prussian blue staining. The gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Ferroptosis-related protein expression in SIMD heart tissues and H9C2 cardiomyocytes was examined via western blotting to determine the regulatory role of butyrate. RESULTS: Sepsis-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis was characterized by a significant reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. Echocardiographic assessments (CO, EF), myocardial injury markers (BNP, cTnI), histopathological analysis (H&E staining), and cardiomyocyte ultrastructure (TEM) demonstrated that butyrate administration significantly alleviated myocardial injury in SIMD. Mechanistically, butyrate mitigated oxidative stress by increasing GSH levels and reducing MDA levels. Furthermore, butyrate treatment reversed the sepsis-induced downregulation of GPX4 and suppressed the upregulation of ACSL4 and PTGS2, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the protective role of butyrate in SIMD, with ferroptosis inhibition serving as a key cardioprotective mechanism. Targeting gut microbiota-derived butyrate may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis-induced myocardial injury."
41138617,Hybridized artificial intelligence system for reducing neonatal mortality in Nigeria.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal diseases represent the leading cause of death in Nigeria, ranking the country second globally in neonatal mortality rates. Early and accurate diagnosis remains challenging, leading to delayed interventions and increased mortality. AIM: To develop an artificial intelligence system capable of detecting multiple neonatal diseases using local datasets and advanced machine learning techniques to facilitate early intervention and reduce neonatal mortality in Southwest Nigeria. METHODS: Clinical records from 4,027 previously treated neonatal patients were collected from five tertiary hospitals across three Southwest Nigerian states. The dataset underwent comprehensive analysis, balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and preprocessing before training three deep learning models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a novel hybrid LSTM-ANN architecture. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics with rigorous subject-wise validation and statistical testing. RESULTS: The hybrid LSTM-ANN model demonstrated superior performance with 82 % accuracy, 88 % precision, 82 % recall, and 86 % F1-score, significantly outperforming both standalone ANN (80 % accuracy) and LSTM (77 % accuracy). Disease-specific classification revealed exceptional performance for sepsis (precision: 0.90, F1-score: 0.88), birth asphyxia (0.88, 0.85), jaundice (0.86, 0.83), and prematurity (0.82, 0.80). McNemar's test confirmed significant hybrid superiority over ANN (chi2 = 12.45, p < 0.001) and LSTM (chi2 = 15.67, p < 0.001), whilst Friedman test (chi2 = 18.42, p < 0.001) validated the 5-6 % accuracy improvement. CONCLUSION: The hybrid LSTM-ANN model establishes a valuable diagnostic tool for early neonatal disease detection. However, external validation and prospective clinical trials are necessary before clinical deployment."
41137071,Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Lactate, traditionally viewed as a biomarker of hypoxia and severity in critical illness, has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic agent. Its roles extend beyond energy metabolism to include anti-inflammatory and signaling functions. This review explores the evolving evidence supporting lactates therapeutic application in critical care settings. MAIN BODY: We synthesize current knowledge on lactate physiology, including its production, transport, and metabolism across organs. Experimental models and clinical studies data suggest that exogenous lactate, particularly in the form of hypertonic sodium lactate (HSL), improves hemodynamics, reduces inflammation, and enhances organ function in sepsis, acute heart failure, and brain injury. Lactate administration shows promise in restoring metabolic homeostasis, improving microcirculation, and supporting cardiac and cerebral recovery. However, clinical studies in critical care remain limited, largely because lactate is predominantly regarded as a marker of poor prognosis rather than as a potential energy substrate with therapeutic value. CONCLUSION: Lactate-based therapy represents a paradigm shift in the management of critical illness. While preclinical data are promising, larger, well-designed randomized trials are needed to establish its safety, efficacy, and optimal indications. The therapeutic repositioning of lactate could complement or replace current resuscitation fluids and metabolic modulators in intensive care unit (ICU)."
41136950,"The combined effect of statin and vitamin C in patients with pulmonary septic shock: a single-center, double-blind clinical trial.",2025,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treating septic shock requires a multifactorial plan, such as anti-inflammatory drugs and newer drugs to reduce inflammation. This study investigated the effect of a combination (statin and vitamin C) on septic shock mortality and disease symptoms. METHODS: In this double-blind clinical trial study, 60 patients with septic shock hospitalized in the intensive care unit were assigned into two groups: intervention (1 gram of vitamin C was prescribed once a day for 5 days, and atorvastatin 40 mg daily) and control (routine treatment). Inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum ferritin (SF) and lactate), patient conditions, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were monitored and recorded on the fifth and seventh days of hospitalization, and the day of discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: While mortality had no difference between the groups (p > 0.05), the duration of receiving inotrope was significantly shorter in the intervention group (p < 0.05). After the intervention, the measures of SOFA score, CRP, LDH, SF, and Lactate in the intervention group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Besides, the measures of the biomarkers, including CRP, LDH, and SF, were significantly different in the intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the simultaneous use of statin and vitamin C can reduce inflammation indicators in ICU-admitted sepsis patients; however, this short-term intervention had no effect on mortality in the patients."
41135872,Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as a sensitive and specific biomarker for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in pre-term infants.,2026,"PURPOSE: Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) levels have been shown to be elevated in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We hypothesized that plasma I-FABP is a specific biomarker for NEC that can differentiate NEC from other common diseases with similar presentations in neonates. METHODS: With IRB approval, neonates born at <34 weeks' gestation had residual plasma samples scavenged from routine blood draws. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients diagnosed with NEC and other pathologies (sepsis, feeding intolerance, and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP)). Samples collected within 7 days preceding and 7 days after diagnosis were utilized for plasma I-FABP quantification by ELISA. Healthy age-matched patients were selected as controls. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with mixed effects analysis in this case-control study. RESULTS: Over a ten-month period 69 patients were enrolled, of which 7 were diagnosed with NEC, 9 were diagnosed with other common pathologies, and 8 were chosen as healthy controls. Plasma I-FABP was significantly higher in the NEC cohort prior to, at diagnosis, and after diagnosis compared to those with other pathologies and healthy controls (p < 0.0001). ROC curve analysis identified an I-FABP cutoff of 5.5 ng/ml as predictive of NEC compared to other pathologies with sensitivity of 75 % and specificity of 100 % (AUC 0.95). CONCLUSION: Plasma I-FABP has the potential to distinguish between patients with NEC and healthy patients or those with other common pathologies with similar presentations (sepsis, feeding intolerance)."
41135862,MicroRNA whole-blood profiling in hospitalized patients with candidemia identified miR-125a-5p and miR-99b-5p as potential biomarkers for Candida albicans bloodstream infection.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Analyze miRNA and mRNA expression in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida spp. (CNA). PATIENTS/METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 adults with candidemia (10 CA and 10 CNA) and 22 hospitalized controls without sepsis but with comparable comorbidities. miRNA and mRNA expression were determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qPCR. Integrated miRNA-mRNA and KEGG/Reactome enrichment analyses were used to predict miRNA targets and identify perturbed pathways. RESULTS: NGS detected seven dysregulated miRNAs in CA vs controls. qPCR confirmed marked overexpression of miR-125a-5p and miR-99b-5p in CA compared with CNA and controls. No miRNAs were differentially expressed between the CNA and control groups. RNA-Seq revealed that 22, 111, and 152 genes were differentially expressed in CA vs controls, CNA vs controls, and CA vs CNA, respectively. Enrichment analysis highlighted cell-cycle and DNA-replication programs in both species groups, while CA uniquely affected histidine/phenylalanine metabolism. Integrated mapping linked upregulated miR-125a-5p to repression of pro-apoptotic and immune-modulatory genes, whereas miR-99b-5p targeted cell-cycle checkpoint genes. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-125a-5p and miR-99b-5p in whole blood may discriminate C. albicans candidemia. These miRNAs are promising rapid biomarkers and targets for antifungal therapy."
41134571,Syndromic Analysis of Sepsis Cohorts Using Large Language Models.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: Presenting signs and symptoms affect the care of patients with possible sepsis. However, signs and symptoms are not incorporated into most large observational studies because they are difficult to extract from clinical notes at scale. OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract presenting signs and symptoms from admission notes and characterize their associations with infectious diagnoses, multidrug-resistant infections, and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study obtained data from 5 Massachusetts hospitals within 1 health care system between June 1, 2015, and August 1, 2022. Participants were hospitalized adult patients with possible infection (determined by blood culture drawn and intravenous antibiotics administered within 24 hours of arrival). An LLM (LLaMA 3 8B; Meta) was used to extract up to 10 presenting signs and symptoms from each patient's history-and-physical admission notes. LLM-generated labels were validated by blinded review of 303 random admission notes. Data analyses were performed from July 2023 to August 2025. EXPOSURES: Thirty most common signs and symptoms were retained as exposures, and unsupervised clustering was used to create syndromes, which were compared with infection sources derived from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included positive cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), positive cultures for multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) organisms, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, comorbidities, physiologic markers of severity of illness, and time to antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the 104 248 patients (median [IQR] age, 66 [52-78] years; 54 137 males [51.9%]) included, 23 619 (22.7%) had sepsis without shock, 25 990 (24.9%) had septic shock, and 94 913 (91.0%) had 1 or more admission note within 24 hours. The LLM labeled the notes of 93 674 of 94 913 patients (98.7%). On manual validation, LLM labels had an accuracy of 99.3% (95% CI, 99.2%-99.3%), balanced accuracy of 84.6% (95% CI, 83.5%-85.8%), positive predictive value of 68.4% (95% CI, 66.0%-70.7%), sensitivity of 69.7% (95% CI, 67.3%-72.0%), and specificity of 99.6% (95% CI, 99.6%-99.6%) compared with the physician medical record reviewer. The 30 most common signs and symptoms were clustered into syndromes that correlated with infection sources. Presence of skin and soft tissue symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.49-2.00) and absence of gastrointestinal (AOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54-0.73) or urinary tract symptoms (AOR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.50) were associated with MRSA culture positivity; inverse associations were seen for MDRGN organisms. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were associated with increased mortality (AOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.17-1.45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that an LLM accurately extracted presenting signs and symptoms from admission notes that clustered into syndromes differentially correlated with infection sources, multidrug-resistant infections, and mortality. Further research is warranted to evaluate the value of large-scale sign-and-symptom data in models of antibiotic choice, effectiveness, and outcomes in patients with possible sepsis."
41133514,"Evaluation of Platelet Indices and Reticulated Platelets Using the ADVIA 2120 Analyzer in Patients with Acute Infection or Acute Coronary Syndrome, at Onset.",2025,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in platelet indices (PLT) provided by the ADVIA 2120 hematology analyzer (Siemens Hematology System) in the early stages of onset of infections and acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). METHODS: Samples were selected from 40 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with suspected uncomplicated sepsis at presentation, from 40 patients with a biochemical diagnosis of ACS at presentation and from 40 apparently healthy subjects. These samples were tested for PLT and PLT indices [mean platelet volume (MPV); mean platelet mass (MPM); mean platelet component (MPC); immature platelets (RtcPlts)] obtained by automation with the ADVIA 2120 and specific biomarkers for sepsis [white blood cells (WBCs); neutrophil granulocytes (NGs); presepsin (PSP); procalcitonin (Pct); C-reactive protein (CRP)] and for SCA (hs cTnI). RESULTS: Platelet indices (RtcPlts, MPV, MPM) were significantly altered (p > 0.005) in patients with suspected sepsis and patients with ACS compared to control subjects; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups of patients with disease. Cutoff values (ROC curves) were obtained for platelet indices that best discriminated healthy subjects from subjects with severe infection or ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, in subjects with suspected sepsis and ACS at disease onset, a state of early platelet activation exists that is not disease-specific. Immature platelets (RtcPlts) and the platelet indices MPM and MPV, provided by the ADVIA 2120 hematology analyzer, showed high sensitivity in subjects with suspected sepsis or ACS at disease onset."
41133492,"Right Heart Failure in Critical and Chronic Care: Current Concepts, Challenges and Mechanical Support Strategies.",2025,"Right heart failure (RHF) remains an under-recognized yet devastating condition in critically ill and chronic patients, frequently complicating cardiac surgery, pulmonary embolism, advanced heart failure, sepsis and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Despite growing awareness, clinical decision making is still hampered by the complex pathophysiology, limitations in diagnosis and a fragmented therapeutic landscape. In recent years, progress in hemodynamic phenotyping, advanced echocardiographic and biomarker-based assessment, and the development of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) systems, including percutaneous and surgical right ventricle assist devices (RVAD), veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO), Impella RP (right percutaneous) or BiPella (Impella CP/5.0/5.5 + Impella RP) has expanded the armamentarium for managing RHF. This review synthetizes current evidences on the anatomical, physiological and molecular underpinnings of RHF, delineates the distinction and continuum between acute and chronic forms and provides a comparative analysis of diagnostic tools and MCS strategies. By integrating mechanistic insights with emerging clinical frameworks, the review aims to support earlier recognition, tailored management and innovative therapeutic approaches for this high-risk population."
41133165,Machine learning-based mortality risk prediction models in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a systematic review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly utilized to predict mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), frequently surpassing traditional scoring systems. Despite their efficacy, inconsistencies in model quality remain a concern. This review aims to evaluate existing ML-based SA-AKI mortality prediction models, with a focus on development quality, methodological rigor, and predictive performance. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess ML-based mortality risk prediction models for SA-AKI patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search on ML-based SA-AKI mortality prediction models was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science from the inception of these databases until July 2025. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed model quality employing the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Artificial Intelligence. RESULTS: Nine studies were included, all of which entailed model development and validation phases; five were solely internally validated while four underwent external validation as well. The studies utilized 18 different algorithms, with Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting being the most prevalent. The majority of the studies employed K-nearest neighbor or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations for handling missing values and utilized Recursive Feature Elimination, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, and Boruta's algorithm for feature selection. Seven studies assessed model calibration performance. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the training sets generally ranged from 0.75 to 0.99, which decreased to 0.70 to 0.87 during internal validation. Extreme Gradient Boosting consistently showed robust performance in external validation. The final predictors encompassed six principal categories: demographic information, vital signs, laboratory tests, disease severity, comorbidities, and interventions. CONCLUSIONS: ML models demonstrate promising performance and applicability in predicting mortality risk in SA-AKI patients, with consistent core predictors. Nevertheless, most studies exhibit a potential risk of bias. Future efforts should aim to enhance the standardization of data processing, feature selection, and validation processes. Additionally, there is a need to focus on the construction of prospective models based on early variables, and to ensure the interpretability and clinical integration of the models to facilitate their practical application in healthcare workflows.

41132762,Rapid bedside measurement of reactive oxygen species in neonates: a pilot study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers for the early detection of severe neonatal conditions, such as necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis, remain inadequate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during neutrophil activation are emerging as potential biomarkers of these diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of bedside ROS measurement and establish baseline levels in neonates. METHODS: Using the FLP-H4200 fluorescence-based system, OCl(-) were measured from 3 mul of whole blood. Twenty neonates (13 preterm and seven full-term) were included. On postpartum day 4, OCl(-) levels were measured using residual blood samples. RESULTS: Baseline OCl(-) levels averaged 31,340 +/- 10,674 and 26,022 +/- 11,363 in full-term and preterm neonates, respectively (p = 0.35). No significant correlations were observed between OCl(-) levels and gestational age, birth weight, maternal milk intake, bilirubin, and C-reactive protein levels. DISCUSSION: The FLP-H4200 system is feasible for rapid and minimally invasive ROS measurement in neonates. Although no significant associations with clinical factors were identified, elevated ROS levels compared with those in adults suggest neonatal adaptation to oxidative stress. Further research is required to evaluate ROS dynamics progressively and their clinical use in neonatal disease prediction."
41131449,Revolutionizing sepsis diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning models: a systematic literature review.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition resulting from a dysregulated immune response to infection, often leading to organ failure and death. Early detection is vital, as delays significantly worsen outcomes. In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), has shown great promise in enhancing early sepsis detection by identifying digital biomarkers from large-scale clinical datasets. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes existing ML/DL approaches applied to sepsis prediction, with an emphasis on intensive care unit (ICU) settings. A total of 80 studies were included, covering diverse data sources (e.g., MIMIC-III, eICU), feature selection methods, algorithm types, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics. The models ranged from traditional techniques like logistic regression and decision trees to advanced architectures such as LSTM, transformers, and ensemble methods. A key contribution of this review is the inclusion of a forest plot summarizing reported AUC and sensitivity values from selected studies, offering a comparative visual of diagnostic performance. This helps highlight the relative effectiveness of different models and provides insights into their generalizability across clinical datasets. The review also discusses challenges related to model interpretability, ethical considerations, and the lack of external and temporal validation in many studies. It further identifies trends such as the use of real-time EHR data, patient-specific model development, and explainability tools like SHAP for clinician trust. By mapping out methodological strengths and limitations in current research, this work provides actionable recommendations for future studies and clinical deployment. The review contributes to the development of more robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant ML/DL models for early sepsis detection and improved patient care outcomes."
41130788,Global incidence and risk factors for injury-related bloodstream infections: a scoping review.,2025,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) can be a serious complication among injured patients. Understanding the burden of injury-related BSI is important for early detection and implementing appropriate treatments to improve patient outcomes. Incidence rates and risk factors are important measures that help provide insights into the burden of injury-related BSIs and early diagnosis of patients. In this review, the aim was to comprehensively summarize incidence rates and risk factors for injury-related BSIs from scientific literature. Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL [via EBSCOhost], Embase, and Web of Science) were searched. There were no limitations on the language. Studies reporting the incidence rates or risk factors associated with incidence or adverse outcomes from injury-related BSIs were included. Database searches returned 9830 articles, of which 48 were included. Incidence rates of injury-related BSIs ranged from 0.71 to 27.4 episodes per 1000 patient-days. A total of 237 potential factors associated with the development and/or outcomes of injury-related BSIs were identified and classified into 8 broad categories: demographics, prognostic scores, burn extent, clinical and patient health factors, biomarkers, resource utilization and treatments, pathogens and injuries, and mechanisms. Older age, male sex, higher injury severity score, longer length of stay, greater total body surface burn area, and inhalation injuries were the most frequently reported risk factors. This review identified a large variation in reported incidence rates but no population-based studies. Many factors have been associated with injury-related BSIs; however, the direction of association and effect sizes vary across the studies, which can be attributed to the differences in study design."
41129971,"IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-17A elevations and glutathione depletion predict severe MODS and mortality in critically ill children with COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis: a prospective cohort study from the Brazilian Amazon.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), particularly when triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the association between inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and the development and outcome of MODS in critically ill children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial infections. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center cohort study (May 2020-December 2024), 62 pediatric patients (29 days to <18 years) were stratified into three groups: SARS-CoV-2 without MODS (n = 22), SARS-CoV-2 with MODS (n = 20), and bacterial MODS (n = 20). Circulating cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17A) and oxidative stress markers (GSH, TBARS, TEAC) were quantified at PICU admission and on day 5. Associations with organ dysfunction and 28-day mortality were assessed using non-parametric statistical analyses and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: MODS groups exhibited on day 1 sustained elevations in TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A-most pronounced in bacterial MODS (Group 3; p < 0.0001). IFN-gamma was notably increased in viral MODS (Group 2). Group 3 also showed marked elevations in IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10 (p < 0.0001). By day 5, both MODS groups demonstrated significant reduced GSH and TEAC and elevated TBARS, the most severe in Group 3. In contrast, Group 1 exhibited stable cytokine profiles and preserved antioxidant status throughout. Non-survivors showed persistently elevated IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A, coupled with sustained depletion of GSH and TEAC, and increased TBARS levels (all p < 0.0001). IL-6 and IFN-gamma were particularly elevated in non-survivors with bacterial and viral MODS, respectively. Biomarker trajectories diverged between survivors and non-survivors by day 5, with failure to normalize immune-redox profiles associated with mortality. Accessible indices such as NLR, CAR, and VIS correlated with biomarker levels and disease severity. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed reduced survival in MODS groups (p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: A distinct cytokine and oxidative stress signature-marked by early and sustained elevations in IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and TBARS, and depletion of GSH and TEAC-is associated with mortality in pediatric MODS. Bacterial MODS was distinguished by the most severe immune-redox imbalance. Integrated immune-redox profiling offers prognostic value and may inform precision-targeted interventions, particularly in resource-limited settings."
41129337,Identification and validation of key genes related to arginine methylation modification in sepsis using transcriptome combined with Mendelian randomization analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sepsis often exhibit a decrease in lymphatic numbers, which can be facilitated by protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT). However, it is unclear how PRMT contributes to lymphopenia in sepsis. METHODS: This study employed the sepsis-related datasets (GSE65682 and GSE134347) and 9 PRMT genes. Firstly, we intersected the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module genes to identify DE-PRMT-related genes (DE-PRMT-RGs). Thereafter, candidate key genes were obtained after Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and machine learning screening. Eventually, we subjected key genes identified by expression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune infiltration analysis, immune checkpoint analysis, molecular docking, regulatory networks construction, and nomogram development. RESULTS: We firstly intersected 4,246 DEGs with 1,884 PRMT scoring module genes to obtain 969 DE-PRMT-RGs. Further MR analysis and machine learning jointly identified 5 candidate genes (CRLF3, ELAC2, PBX2, MCTP2, and EMB). Among these, ELAC2, PBX2, MCTP2, and EMB demonstrated consistent expression trends, with the area under the curve (AUC) values of the ROC curve exceeding 0.7 in GSE65682 and GSE134347. Therefore, they were defined as key PRMT-related genes. The GSEA analysis showed enrichment in cytoplasmic translation (ELAC2, MCTP2), non-coding RNA metabolism (EMB), and metabolic processes (PBX2). The immune infiltration analysis revealed a significant correlation between PBX2 and neutrophils, as well as between ELAC2/MCTP2/EMB with activated NK cells, CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: In this study, ELAC2, PBX2, MCTP2 and EMB were identified as key genes related to PRMT for sepsis, which provided a theoretical basis for the study of sepsis."
41126850,Oxycardiorespirograms in neonatal monitoring-current gaps and future potential of artificial intelligence: a mini-review.,2025,"The neonatal oxycardiorespirogram (OCRG) captures synchronized, multi-channel recordings of respiratory patterns, heart rate variability, transcutaneous oxygen tension, and relative skin perfusion in neonates. As a non-invasive, point-of-care modality, OCRG is routinely used to assess cardiorespiratory stability in high-risk infants, particularly preterm neonates at risk for apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation. These events can persist beyond hospital discharge, elevating morbidity and mortality, yet no standardized tool reliably predicts which infants will experience clinically significant post-discharge episodes. Although OCRG is established in clinical practice, its rich time-series data remains largely underutilized for predictive modeling. In contrast, machine learning methods have achieved strong performance in related neonatal monitoring tasks - such as apnea detection, sepsis prediction, sleep staging, and extubation readiness - by integrating multimodal biosignals and temporal modeling strategies. These advances highlight the opportunity to apply machine learning analytics and explainability methods to OCRG data, enabling the discovery of physiological patterns, refining risk stratification, and informing individualized interventions such as the timing of caffeine withdrawal, initiation of home monitoring, or discharge planning. Given the multimodal and sequential structure of OCRGs, time-series-based machine learning, including both shallow and deep learning approaches, represents particularly promising analytic strategies for future applications. This mini-review synthesizes current gaps in OCRG-based analytics, examines transferable lessons from existing machine learning applications in neonatal biosignals, and outlines a translational roadmap for evolving OCRG from a descriptive monitoring tool into a predictive platform for precision neonatal care."
41126085,Blood cultures and predicting positivity in extremely preterm infants admitted to an outborn level IV NICU.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To determine if there were clinical factors that could identify patients with positive blood cultures in extremely preterm (EP) infants born at < 27 weeks gestation who underwent sepsis evaluation sometime after admission to a level IV NICU in an all referral children's hospital. METHODS: An observational study using data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 530 EP infants admitted during the study, 345 EP infants (64%) had at least one blood culture drawn, of whom 64 (19%) had at least one positive blood culture. A total of 714 blood cultures were drawn at a median age of 41 days (IQR 15-87 days), of which 70 (9%) were positive. For the positive cultures, 47% grew gram positive bacteria, 44% grew gram negative bacteria, and 9% grew yeast. EP patients with positive blood cultures were more frequently on invasive mechanical ventilation and more often had a central line compared to EP patients with negative cultures. EP infants with positive blood cultures had greater mortality and surgical NEC than EP infants without positive cultures. Using logistic regression modeling, abnormal band counts (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.003-1.06) and the initiation of vasopressors at the time of sepsis evaluation (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.21-5.65) were the only clinical factors associated with a positive culture. CONCLUSIONS: Most EP infants admitted to an all-referral Level IV NICU had a blood culture drawn. The rate of positive cultures was relatively low, although EP infants with positive blood cultures had higher rates of mortality and morbidities. Further work to develop biomarkers for the rapid identification of sepsis in EP infants is urgently needed."
41121298,An interpretable machine learning model integrating computed tomography radiomics and clinical features for predicting the urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a critical health risk necessitating prompt medical identification and intervention. Nevertheless, a deficiency exists in the availability of a tool for precise and timely predictive analysis. The purpose is to establish a machine learning (ML) model using radiomic features and clinical data to predict urosepsis following PCNL. METHOD: This study retrospectively included 401 patients with kidney stones from two centers who underwent PCNL. To enhance the dataset's equilibrium, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique for regression with Gaussian noise (SMOGN) was used to resample the training set. The screening of radiomics features and the construction of radiomics scores were completed by applying the Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). Subsequently, the critical clinical indicators for urosepsis were pinpointed through the application of a multivariate logistic regression. The performance of seven ML algorithms was compared for the combined dataset that incorporated clinical variables and radiomics scores. The efficacy of these models was assessed through the implementation of a fivefold cross-validation process. Ultimately, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology was utilized to provide a visual and interpretative analysis of the optimal model. RESULT: Among 401 patients, 30 cases (7.48%) were diagnosed with urosepsis. The radiomics score, established by 13 radiomics features, was combined with six important clinical features (including urine nitrite positivity, stone volume, mean intrarenal pressures, urine white blood cells, and operation time) to construct a combined dataset. Comparative analysis of seven machine learning (ML) models revealed that CatBoost demonstrated superior predictive performance. The model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) values of 0.88, 0.94, and 0.89 on the training, internal test, and external validation sets, respectively. Corresponding area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) values were 0.92, 0.75, and 0.63. The SHAP value method identifies key features influencing prediction outcomes, with the radiomics score and urine nitrite positivity being the top contributors to the model. We deployed the optimal prediction model to a web for clinical application ( https://predictive-model-for-urosepsis.streamlit.app/ ). CONCLUSION: This study constructed a predictive model that incorporates clinical risk characteristics and radiomics scores to assess the risk of urosepsis after PCNL, with SHAP visualization for clinical physicians to formulate evaluation strategies."
41121294,Development and validation of a diagnostic prediction model for acute liver injury in sepsis based on serum ferritin level.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The early diagnosis and treatment of acute liver injury in sepsis are crucial determinants of the prognosis for patients with sepsis. The study aimed to investigate the early predictive value of serum ferritin level for acute liver injury in sepsis, to construct and validate a predictive model for acute liver injury in patients with sepsis. METHOD: The training group data were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Boruta algorithm, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify relevant independent risk factors, and these factors were incorporated into the predictive model. A sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the result. We constructed a nomogram prediction model based on ferritin level and evaluated its performance using the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Collected patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Hospital who met the sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria as clinical validation group data, and clinical data were applied to the prediction model to validate its predictive performance. RESULTS: This study included 1109 sepsis patients from the MIMIC database and 122 sepsis patients from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Hospital. Based on the outcome of total bilirubin (TBIL) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) after ICU admission, patients were divided into two groups: the sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) group and the non-sepsis-associated acute liver injury (non-SALI) group. Analysis of the two groups' data revealed the following: the Lasso regression and Boruta algorithm results for the SALI group and the non-SALI group intersected to identify 12 differential factors; after propensity score matching (PSM), ferritin level remained statistically different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that machine ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), vasoactive agent, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), international normalized ratio (INR), and ferritin level were independent risk factors for secondary acute liver injury (P < 0.05); ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of the prediction models in the training and clinical validation groups were 0.765 and 0.773 respectively, with no statistically significant difference; Calibration curves were tightly aligned to the ideal line, indicating good agreement between predicted and actual outcomes; decision curve analysis provided evidence that the prediction model has high clinical utility with significant net benefit. CONCLUSION: Higher serum ferritin level is an independent risk factor for acute liver injury in patients with sepsis. Based on the variable, we constructed a model including six clinical features to predict the risk of acute liver injury in patients with sepsis. After validation with an external clinical dataset, the model demonstrated excellent predictive ability and high value for assisting clinical decision-making."
41121019,Association between serum phosphate levels and length of hospital stay in infants with neonatal sepsis: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Research on the association of serum phosphate levels with the severity and prognosis of neonatal diseases is limited. Neonatal sepsis is the primary cause of neonatal mortality. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between serum phosphate levels and neonatal sepsis outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Pediatric Intensive Care (PIC) database (2010-2018). Neonatal sepsis was diagnosed based on ICD-10 codes. Serum phosphate levels within 72 h of sepsis diagnosis were selected. Outcomes were severe sepsis, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (hospital Los.), and ICU stay (ICU Los.). Covariates included demographic and clinical characteristics as well as serum biomarkers. Multi-variable regression and subgroup analyses were performed to explore the association between serum phosphate levels and neonatal sepsis outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 120 infants with neonatal sepsis were included, and their characteristics were analyzed according to serum phosphate tertiles. The median age was 3.0 (1.0, 17.0) days. The proportion of male infants was 62.5% (75/120). The proportion of preterm infants was 44.2% (53/120). The incidence of late-onset sepsis was 60.8% (73/120). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the serum phosphate level at sepsis diagnosis was associated with hospital Los. and remained so after adjustment for all covariates. Each 1 mmol/L decrease in serum phosphate level prolonged the length of hospital stay by 7.53 days. The low serum phosphate group had an 11.75-day longer hospital stay than the high serum phosphate group. Curve fitting showed a negative linear correlation between serum phosphate levels and hospital Los. in infants with neonatal sepsis and no significant interactions were observed in the subgroup analysis; however, serum phosphate levels were not independently associated with ICU Los. In addition, no correlation was found between serum phosphate levels and mortality or the severity of sepsis in neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia is highly prevalent in neonates with sepsis. Lower serum phosphate levels are associated with prolonged hospital stay in neonates with sepsis. Strengthening the monitoring of serum phosphate levels in neonates with sepsis and maintaining the homeostasis of phosphate in the body can promote refined management of neonatal sepsis and help improve the prognosis of the patients."
41120704,Streamlined machine learning model for early sepsis risk prediction in burn patients.,2025,"Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in burn patients, yet early identification remains difficult due to persistent hyperinflammatory responses and altered baseline physiology. We developed a streamlined machine learning model for early sepsis risk prediction in burn patients using data from 6629 patients across 11 centers participating in the German Burn Registry. The model was trained using only six admission-level variables (age, burned body surface area, deep partial-thickness burns, full-thickness burns, inhalation injury, and hypertension), selected through multiple feature selection methods and evaluated using cross-validated machine learning pipelines. The final Random Forest model achieved an AUROC of 0.91, sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.85, and a negative predictive value of 0.98, enabling reliable early risk stratification immediately upon ICU admission. By relying solely on admission-level variables, this model offers a reliable and interpretable solution for early sepsis risk detection in burn patients, supporting timely interventions and potentially improving critical care outcomes."
41120398,Predictive value of PD-1(+)CD3(+) T cells for 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.,2025,"Increased expression of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) on T lymphocyte subsets is associated with sepsis immunosuppression and offers potential biomarkers for prognosis. However, few studies have assessed the effect of PD-1 expression on CD3(+) T lymphocytes in predicting sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between PD-1 expression on CD3(+) T lymphocytes and 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis. A total of 180 patients with sepsis, comprising 117 survivors and 63 non-survivors, were included in the analysis. Lymphocyte counts and PD-1 expression on T lymphocytes were quantified in peripheral blood samples through the application of flow cytometry. Regression models, receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) and reclassification analyses were performed to assess the relationship between the biomarkers under investigation and 30-day mortality. Results showed the level of PD-1 expressing CD3(+) T cells was obviously increased in the non-survivor group compared with the group that survived (P < 0.05). Based on multiple logistic regression analysis, PD-1(+)CD3(+)T cells (OR = 1.02, P < 0.05), SOFA score (OR = 1.20, P < 0.05) and APACHE II score (OR = 1.14, P < 0.05) were independent risk factors for mortality of sepsis. PD-1(+)CD3(+) T cells showed an area under the curve(AUC) of 0.623(95% CI, 0.534-0.713) in predicting sepsis mortality. AUCs for SOFA and APACHE II scores were 0.706 (95% CI, 0.624-0.789) and 0.784 (95% CI, 0.714-0.854), respectively. Adding PD-1(+)CD3(+) T cells to the SOFA and APACHE II scoring systems significantly improved predictive accuracy, with an AUC enhancement and a top Youden's index of 0.553. The Cox regression analysis revealed significantly lower 30-day survival rates in patients with high PD-1 expressing CD3(+) T cells (> 36.56%). PD-1 expression on CD3(+)T lymphocytes can serve as a promising prognostic biomarker in sepsis patients, enhancing the predictive accuracy of APACHE II and SOFA scores."
41120336,Sepsis and organ failure are the major risks for allogeneic transplant patients in the post- or late- engraftment phase admitted to the ICU.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can lead to complications, depending on the period of the transplantation. Our study aimed to evaluate the outcome and prognostic parameters for the survival of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the post- or late-engraftment phase. METHODS: The survival of patients aged >/= 18 years in the post- or predominantly late-engraftment phase was analyzed retrospectively by using baseline data, laboratory parameters, scoring systems and vital parameters. RESULTS: 46 cases were recorded. Sepsis-related respiratory failure was the leading ICU admission cause. Invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.048) and renal replacement therapy (p < 0.001) showed a significant impact on survival. Furthermore, a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA-score) > 7 (p = 0.033), an Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation Score II (APACHE-II-score) > 14 (p = 0.017) and a Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II-score) > 35 (p = 0.001) showed a significantly lower survival. DISCUSSION: Sepsis and organ failure remain substantial factors in ICU mortality, as reflected by clinical scores, laboratory parameters and intensive care interventions. Furthermore, our data indicates that demographic factors like age do not affect the outcome of allo-HSCT. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that this specific engraftment cohort does not demonstrate different survival rates compared to patients in the early and post-engraftment phases. However, organ failure and sepsis remain significant contributors to the high mortality rates observed in the ICU."
41116817,Pyroptosis-Related Genes as Prognostic Biomarkers and Immune Infiltration Features in Sepsis-Induced ARDS: A Single-Cell and Bulk RNA-Sequencing Analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and costly syndrome with high mortality and poor prognosis without targeted therapies. Recently, pyroptosis has been demonstrated to be an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. However, the expression of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in sepsis-induced ARDS and their correlation with prognosis remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, 760 sepsis samples from public datasets were analyzed. We first conducted a comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of sepsis from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and identified 8 cell types and 38 hub genes. Subsequently, we used univariate Cox hazard analysis to narrow down the candidate genes and developed a prognostic model using the disease cohorts, which stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups. Four genes associated with the prognosis of patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit for >/= 28 days were identified. RESULTS: High-risk patients have lower proportions of activated CD8(+) T, effector memory CD8(+) T, and memory B cells. The majority of the immune cells were positively correlated with each other. However, there was a negative association between neutrophils and other factors. Importantly, correlations between prognostic genes and the corresponding immune cells revealed that CCL5, CD3G, and IL7R were significantly associated with activated CD8+ T cells, and GIMAP4 was significantly negatively correlated with immune cells. Multivariate analysis identified the risk score as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: PRGs play a significant role in sepsis immunity. The above four key genes (CCL5, CD3G, IL7R, and GIMAP4) are expected to serve as clinical diagnostic targets, providing a basis for clinical prognosis stratification in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS and guiding the formulation of individualized treatment strategies."
41114830,Elevated circulating dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (cDPP3) as a predictor of postoperative complications in esophagectomy patients.,2025,"PURPOSE: Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer carries high postoperative morbidity and mortality. Circulating dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (cDPP3) is a novel biomarker linked to organ failure in acute care. This study evaluates its prognostic value for predicting organ dysfunction and mortality post-esophagectomy. METHODS: This prospective, single-center study included 20 esophagectomy patients. cDPP3 levels were measured preoperatively and at 24, 72, 120, and 168 h postoperatively using a Nexus IB10 Analyzer. Postoperative complications, including pneumonia, anastomotic insufficiency, and SOFA score-based organ dysfunction, were recorded. Correlation analysis assessed associations between cDPP3 levels and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Among 20 patients, the most common complications were pneumonia (n = 12), sepsis (n = 17), and anastomotic insufficiency (n = 5). Elevated cDPP3 levels correlated with SOFA score increases >/= 2 (p < 0.01) and severe complications, including prolonged ICU stays. cDPP3 levels at 72 h were significantly associated with anastomotic insufficiency (p < 0.01). A negative correlation was observed between intraoperative volume and cDPP3 levels at 24 h (r = -0.495, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: cDPP3 is a potential biomarker for postoperative complications after esophagectomy. Its elevation correlates with increased morbidity, highlighting the need for vigilant perioperative management.

41114487,Single-Cell Profiling Identifies JUNB/SPI1-Driven Inflammatory Programs and Novel Communication Axes in Myeloid Cells of Sepsis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a Systemic Inflammatory Response (SIR) caused by invading pathogens. We aimed to characterize infiltrating cells in sepsis and provide novel insight for the treatment of sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-blood scRNA-seq samples from four septic patients and five healthy subjects were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE175453). The Seurat R package was used for quality control and cell clustering by scRNA- seq analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the clusterProfiler R package for pathway enrichment analysis. Then, the SCENIC analysis was used to identify key transcriptional regulons, and the CellChat R package was used for cell communication analysis. RESULTS: We mainly obtained 9 cell clusters, including myeloid cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NKT cells, B cells, plasma B cells, megakaryocytes, mast cells and erythrocytes. Notably, myeloid cells, erythrocytes and mast cells had a higher proportion in sepsis patients. Activated IL-17 and p53 pathways supported anti-infection response in myeloid cells, and JUNB and SPI1 mediated multiple inflammatory pathways, including TNF signaling and neutrophil activation. We also identified that the cell interaction mode of myeloid cells, such as MPZL1-MPZL1 and FASL-FAS, may serve as a potential target for an anti-inflammatory response in sepsis treatment. DISCUSSIONS: The scRNA-seq analysis revealed pro-inflammatory pathways (IL-17, p53) and key regulators (JUNB, SPI1) in septic myeloid cells. Receptor genes (MPZL1 and FAS) mediated cell communication, offering potential biomarkers and targets for sepsis therapy. CONCLUSION: We characterized the pro-inflammatory immune response pathways, transcriptional regulon and cell interaction modes of myeloid cells in the development of sepsis."
41113896,Perioperative Oxidative Stress and Sepsis: Pathophysiological and Clinical Implications.,2025,"The relationship between oxidative stress and sepsis determines how well patients recover from surgery and critical illness. The perioperative period creates conditions for excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production through surgical trauma and anesthesia and tissue hypoperfusion and infection, leading to mitochondrial damage, endothelial harm, and immune system problems. The processes create more inflammation while damaging cellular energy systems, which results in multiple organ system failure. The review examines modern knowledge about perioperative oxidative stress and sepsis mechanisms while discussing treatment implications and new therapeutic approaches. The authors conducted database searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to find English-language peer-reviewed studies about oxidative stress and perioperative sepsis. The authors used the keywords ""oxidative stress"", ""perioperative"", and ""sepsis"" to find relevant studies from 2000 to 2025. The most effective strategy to reduce oxidative damage and enhance patient results involves early infection control, normoxia preservation, and accurate fluid management during perioperative care. The current understanding of oxidative stress has not led to the successful clinical implementation of targeted antioxidant treatments. Research should concentrate on developing individualized antioxidant treatments based on biomarker tests while conducting clinical trials to assess mitochondrial protective effects. The integration of mechanistic knowledge with clinical practice makes oxidative stress modulation a fundamental approach to enhance survival rates of patients with sepsis and those undergoing high-risk surgery."
41113854,Clinical association and potential molecular mechanisms of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe intestinal disease affecting premature infants, with mortality rates of 20%-30%. Clinical studies have shown that neonatal sepsis (NS) is an independent risk factor for NEC; however, the shared molecular mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers between these two conditions remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore the shared molecular mechanisms underlying the association between NS and NEC and to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: This study combines clinical cohort analysis with transcriptomic analysis. First, we enrolled 74 NEC infants and 74 gestational age/birth weight-matched controls from Children's Hospital of Soochow University and quantified the association between NS and NEC using logistic regression analysis. Second, we jointly analyzed transcriptome data from NS (GSE25504) and NEC (GSE46619) datasets to screen for overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify hub genes. Subsequently, the diagnostic efficacy of core genes was evaluated using independent validation cohorts (GSE297483 and GSE69686). Finally, a transcription factor-mRNA regulatory network was constructed using the TRRUST database to explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms. RESULTS: Clinical association analysis showed a significantly increased risk of NEC in NS infants (OR = 3.02, P = 0.002). Infants in the NEC group had significantly higher systemic inflammatory markers and a higher incidence of sepsis (60.81% vs. 33.78%) compared to the control group. Mechanistic studies identified 70 co-directional overlapping DEGs, with 69 upregulated and 1 downregulated. These genes were significantly enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis and IL-17 signaling pathways (P < 0.05). Further investigation identified FPR1, S100A12, and CSF3R as potential biomarkers involved in immune response and inflammatory processes. External validation showed moderate diagnostic performance, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.723 to 0.813. Transcriptional regulation analysis revealed that transcription factors including SPI1, NFKB1, and JUN were identified as potential regulators of inflammatory genes. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that neonatal sepsis may serve as a risk factor for NEC development through shared inflammatory pathways involving FPR1, S100A12, and CSF3R. These genes demonstrated diagnostic potential across both conditions and appear to mediate inflammatory processes involving immune cell recruitment. While these findings suggest new directions for early identification in high-risk infants, further clinical validation is necessary to confirm therapeutic implications."
41112767,Unraveling the role of regulatory cell death in sepsis: an integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell sequencing data.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and dysfunction of multiple organs. Recently, regulatory cell death (RCD) has emerged as a distinct pathological feature and serve as a potential source of biomarkers or therapeutic targets in sepsis. METHODS: Comprehensive transcriptomic datasets of sepsis were accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Genes involved in 18 RCD pathways were compiled from databases and published literature. The limma package was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), CIBERSORT, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were combined to identify key RCDs pathways. Core RCD-related DEGs (RRDs) were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) machine learning methods. The expression patterns and diagnostic performance of the core RRDs were validated across multiple datasets and further confirmed through meta-analysis. Immune localization of RRDs was examined using single-cell transcriptomic data. Prognostic significance was evaluated using multivariate Cox analysis. Finally, the mRNA expression level was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Zinc Finger DHHC-Type Containing 3 (ZDHHC3), Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (CLIC1), Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1), Biogenesis of Lysosomal Organelles Complex 1 Subunit 1 (BLOC1S1), and Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR5) were considered as core RRDs, with monocytes and neutrophils serving as the principal cell types responsible for their overexpression and likely contributing critically to their downstream biological effects. Among them, ZDHHC3 and TLR5 were identified as independent risk factors for sepsis. Their significantly elevated mRNA expression in septic mice was confirmed by qRT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study underscored the crucial role of RCD pathways in the development of sepsis. Notably, ZDHHC3 and TLR5 were identified as novel and robust biomarkers for sepsis."
41112595,"Frontal, temporal, cerebellar changes link to sepsis survivors' cognitive issues: A resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined by organ dysfunction, triggered by a dysregulated host response to infection. there is limited published literature combining cognitive impairment with topological property alterations in brain networks in sepsis survivors. Therefore, we employed graph theory and Granger causality analysis (GCA) methods to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, aiming to explore the topological alterations in the brain networks of intensive care unit (ICU) sepsis survivors. Using correlation analysis, the interplay between topological property alterations and cognitive impairment was also investigated. AIM: To explore the topological alterations of the brain networks of sepsis survivors and their correlation with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixteen sepsis survivors and nineteen healthy controls from the community were recruited. Within one month after discharge, neurocognitive tests were administered to assess cognitive performance. Rs-fMRI was acquired and the topological properties of brain networks were measured based on graph theory approaches. GCA was conducted to quantify effective connectivity (EC) between brain regions showing positive topological alterations and other regions in the brain. The correlations between topological properties and cognitive were analyzed. RESULTS: Sepsis survivors exhibited significant cognitive impairment. At the global level, sepsis survivors showed lower normalized clustering coefficient (gamma) and small-worldness (sigma) than healthy controls. At the local level, degree centrality (DC) and nodal efficiency (NE) decreased in the right orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (ORBinf.R), NE decreased in the left temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus (TPOsup.L) whereas DC and NE increased in the right cerebellum Crus 2 (CRBLCrus2.R). Regarding directional connection alterations, EC from left cerebellum 6 (CRBL6.L) to ORBinf.R and EC from TPOsup.L to right cerebellum 1 (CRBLCrus1.R) decreased, whereas EC from right lingual gyrus (LING.R) to TPOsup.L increased. The implementation of correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between DC in CRBLCrus2.R and both Mini-mental state examination (r = -0.572, P = 0.041) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores (r = -0.629, P = 0.021) at the local level. In the CRBLCrus2.R cohort, a negative correlation was identified between NE and MoCA scores, with a statistically significant result of r = -0.633 and P = 0.020. CONCLUSION: Frontal, temporal and cerebellar topological property alterations are possibly associated with cognitive impairment of ICU sepsis survivors and may serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis."
41112274,Multi-omics analysis reveals neutrophil heterogeneity and key molecular drivers in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is a critical condition driven by immune dysregulation, particularly involving neutrophils, yet their heterogeneity and molecular contributions remain underexplored. This study employed a multi-omics approach, integrating single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing from 21 sepsis samples and Escherichia coli-induced sepsis datasets, alongside bioinformatics, machine learning, and experimental validation in a rat model and human peripheral blood. We identified four neutrophil subtypes-pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, mature, and immature-revealing a significant increase in pro-inflammatory neutrophils in sepsis (40.53% versus 4.19% in controls) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory neutrophils (18.43% versus 27.04%). Four hub genes, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4, caspase 4, complement receptor 1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 14, were pinpointed as key drivers, with peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 mediating neutrophil extracellular trap formation and exacerbating renal damage. In a rat model, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 knockdown reduced trap formation and alleviated kidney injury (p-value less than 0.01). Human samples confirmed elevated gene expression in sepsis (p-value less than 0.05). These findings highlight neutrophil heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms in sepsis, with potential implications for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI), proposing novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine."
41111857,High-Sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hs-CRP) as a Biomarker for Predicting Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Severity and Associated Complications.,2025,"Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common health issue, particularly among women and the elderly, leading to significant morbidity and healthcare burdens. The severity of UTIs can range from uncomplicated cystitis to more severe conditions like pyelonephritis and sepsis, which may cause long-term complications such as renal scarring. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, has gained attention for its potential role in predicting UTI severity and complications. Understanding the relationship between hs-CRP levels and UTI severity could enhance patient management and treatment strategies. Objective This study aims to investigate the relationship between hs-CRP levels and UTI severity, as well as their association with clinical factors such as comorbidities, infection type, and hospital outcomes, with a focus on determining the potential of hs-CRP as a prognostic tool for UTI complications. Methodology A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Mardan Medical Complex from December 2024 to June 2025. A total of 173 UTI patients were included. Participants were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe infection groups based on clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory results. hs-CRP levels were measured using the Roche Cobas e411 analyzer. Demographic data, comorbidities, infection type, and hospitalization details were collected. Statistical analysis, including ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and decision tree modeling, was used to assess associations between hs-CRP levels and infection severity. Results The findings of this study indicate a significant association between elevated hs-CRP levels and the severity of UTIs. The highest hs-CRP concentrations were observed in patients with severe infections, with a mean level of 26.5 mg/L. Moreover, hs-CRP levels were notably correlated with several comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Specifically, patients with hypertension exhibited a mean hs-CRP level of 24.8 mg/L, while those with diabetes had an average level of 22.6 mg/L. Among individuals with chronic kidney disease, hs-CRP levels were even higher, with a mean of 27.34 mg/L. A decision tree analysis identified distinct hs-CRP thresholds that effectively predicted the severity of infections and the likelihood of complications, such as renal scarring and nephrolithiasis. In terms of pathogen distribution, Escherichia coli was the most frequently identified pathogen, found in 54 patients (31.21%). Notably, antibiotic resistance did not have a significant impact on hs-CRP levels (p=0.972). Nevertheless, hs-CRP was confirmed as a reliable biomarker for assessing infection severity and predicting potential complications. Further analysis revealed a clear gradation in hs-CRP levels corresponding to the severity of infection. Patients with mild infections had a mean hs-CRP level of 15.2 mg/L, those with moderate infections had an average of 21.5 mg/L, and individuals with severe infections presented the highest mean hs-CRP levels of 26.5 mg/L (p<0.001). Conclusion Hs-CRP is a reliable biomarker for evaluating UTI severity and predicting complications. Its association with infection severity, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes suggests its potential in clinical decision-making."
41111514,Decoding monocyte heterogeneity in sepsis: a single-cell apoptotic signature for immune stratification and guiding precision therapy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapies in sepsis is often hampered by profound and patient-specific immune heterogeneity. Classical monocytes play a central role in the progression toward sepsis-induced immunoparalysis, with their apoptotic rate serving as a sensitive marker of immune dysfunction. Traditional bulk transcriptomic approaches fail to resolve this complexity. Here, we harness single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate the apoptotic landscape of classical monocytes and identify robust molecular biomarkers for immunological stratification and targeted intervention. METHODS: We integrated single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data from four independent cohorts. A machine learning pipeline incorporating SVM, RF, XGB, and GLM algorithms was used to identify hub genes associated with monocyte apoptosis. A diagnostic nomogram was constructed based on the selected gene signature and validated across external datasets. Clinical relevance was confirmed through Western blot analysis of purified monocytes from sepsis patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: A four-gene signature (G0S2, GZMA, ITM2A, PAG1) emerged as a specific apoptotic fingerprint of classical monocytes. The diagnostic model based on these signature genes demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance, effectively stratifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups (AUC >0.8 across multiple validation cohorts), with each risk group exhibiting distinctly different immune states. High-risk patients exhibited a pro-inflammatory transcriptomic profile with elevated apoptotic pathway activity (e.g., neutrophil degranulation), whereas the low-risk group showed enrichment in adaptive immunity and T cell receptor signaling. Protein-level validation in clinical samples corroborated the transcriptomic findings. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates a critical facet of immune heterogeneity in sepsis through the identification of a validated, four-gene apoptotic signature in classical monocytes. Beyond its diagnostic utility, this signature serves as a molecular indicator of immune state, enabling refined patient stratification. These findings lay the groundwork for precision immunopharmacology, where apoptosis-targeted or anti-inflammatory therapies can be tailored to individual immune profiles."
41109923,Multi-omics nominates VDAC2 as a candidate protective locus in sepsis-associated cholesterol dysregulation.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition, involves dysregulated cholesterol metabolism critical for immune regulation and cellular processes. This study employed multi-omics and machine learning to explore cholesterol metabolism in sepsis, aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets. Transcriptome and single-cell RNA sequencing data for sepsis were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The limma package and WGCNA co-expression network were used to screen genes, hybridized with cholesterol metabolism genes (CMGs) to identify hub genes. Machine learning algorithms screened pivotal genes to construct diagnostic model, validating performance via multi-cohort Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based molecular typing using CMGs, and integration of 101 machine learning algorithms built prognostic models. Single-cell analysis characterized expression patterns of pivotal genes and key subsets. Causal effects and phenotypic associations of target genes were evaluated using Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and PheWAS. Integrated transcriptomic analysis identified three key genes (VDAC1, VDAC2, and LDLRAP1) associated with dysregulated cholesterol metabolism in sepsis. Machine learning-based diagnostic models exhibited high predictive accuracy. NMF clustering revealed two molecular subtypes, with Cluster 1 characterized by immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming, linked to poorer prognosis. A machine learning model integrating 101 algorithms predicted 28-day mortality. The single-cell transcriptome atlas identified CD14(+)CD163(+) monocytes as the hub cell population in the immune microenvironment of sepsis, and the active cholesterol metabolic pathway might constitute the core for regulating the immune response. Elevated VDAC2 expression was significantly correlated with reduced sepsis risk, as determined by SMR analysis. This study underscored cholesterol metabolism's critical role in sepsis pathogenesis. Multi-omics nominates VDAC2 as a candidate protective locus in sepsis-associated cholesterol dysregulation."
41109794,"The effects of balanced crystalloid versus plasma on endothelial injury, systemic inflammation, and coagulation in experimental endotoxaemia: a randomised human volunteer study.",2026,"BACKGROUND: During shock, neutrophil-mediated glycocalyx degradation can lead to exposure of the procoagulant endothelial surface and consequent organ injury. Resuscitation using crystalloid fluids may augment this endothelial damage, while resuscitation using plasma may preserve glycocalyx health. We hypothesised that resuscitation with plasma would preserve glycocalyx integrity by reducing inflammation, glycocalyx shedding, and dyscoagulation in a controlled model of systemic inflammation in human volunteers. METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers were injected with 2 ng kg(-1) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce systemic inflammation. Thirty minutes after LPS administration, participants were randomised to receive 10 ml kg(-1) of either balanced salt solution or solvent detergent plasma (SDP). Plasma syndecan-1, a marker of glycocalyx degradation, was the primary outcome. Additionally, plasma biomarkers of inflammation, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, glycocalyx degradation, endothelial injury, and coagulation were measured serially, by bead-based or enzyme-linked immunoassays. RESULTS: LPS induced a systemic inflammatory response, accompanied by endothelial injury as indicated by increased levels of syndecan-1 (median increase: 2920-4430 pg ml(-1), P<0.05). Participants receiving SDP had lower levels of neutrophils and plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9, compared with those receiving balanced salt solution. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation, inflammation, and glycocalyx degradation were not affected by fluid therapy. SDP reduced LPS-induced prolonged prothrombin time, but had no impact on other biomarkers of coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: In human endotoxaemia, plasma resuscitation reduced leucocyte and neutrophil levels but did not reduce glycocalyx degradation, when compared with equal volume resuscitation with a balanced crystalloid solution."
41107920,Identification of diagnostic biomarkers and mitochondrial metabolic characteristics in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study intended to explore the molecular mechanisms and the mitochondrial metabolic characteristics of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. METHODS: The datasets of S-AKI were acquired from the GEO database while mitochondrial related genes (MRGs) were procured utilizing MitoCarta3.0 database. The ""limma"" R package was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis identified the co-expressed gene modules. GO, together with KEGG, was applied for enrichment analysis. A PPI network was constructed using the STRING database. The LASSO algorithm was adopted to screen prognostic predictors of S-AKI. The correlation between immune cells and diagnostic biomarkers was reflected through immune cell infiltration analysis utilizing CIBERSORT. In cellular experiments, the CCK-8 assay detected the cell viability. RT-qPCR and western blot assessed PMPCA and PMPCB expressions. The release of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers was assessed using ELISA and corresponding assay kits. Western blot assessed the expressions of proteins implicated in mitochondrial function. RESULTS: 163 intersected genes between DEGs and MRGs were screened. 103 key genes were acquired via the intersection of module genes with the 163 MRDEGs and 10 hub genes were determined. Functional enrichment analysis disclosed that the key genes were primarily enriched in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Five significant immune cells showing differences between S-AKI and controls were identified. Correlation analysis displayed a negative association of Gpx4 with resting NK cells, its positive association with M2 macrophages as well as a negative association of Amacr with Th17 Cells. Three independent diagnostic biomarkers Gpx4, PMPCB and Amacr for S-AKI were determined. The validation cellular experiments showed that PMPCB overexpression could alleviate LPS-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and viability damage in HK-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This work determined three independent diagnostic biomarkers in S-AKI, which might shed novel insight into its diagnosis and treatment."
41107565,Dynamic HGI trajectories and their impact on survival in patients with sepsis: a machine learning prognostic model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated a correlation between the glycosylated hemoglobin index (HGI) and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. However, the impact of its dynamic fluctuations on patient outcomes remains insufficiently explored. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between HGI trajectory changes over time and the prognosis of patients with sepsis, and developing an optimal predictive model for 28-day and 90-day mortality risk using machine learning techniques. METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV 3.0 database were employed to construct a linear regression model utilizing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) measured at six distinct time points to calculate HGI. Trajectory analysis revealed three distinct HGI change patterns: rising (RS), stable (ST), and descending (DS). Based on these groupings, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression models, and mediation analysis were applied. Lasso regression was utilized for feature selection, and four machine learning models-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest (RF)-were developed and evaluated through ROC curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were incorporated for interpretability, and nomograms for 28-day and 90-day mortality were generated. RESULTS: A total of 2,616 patients were included in the analysis, with 407 patients (15.56%) dying within 28 days. multivariable Cox regression analysis, using the ST group as a reference, revealed that patients in the RS group had a significantly higher risk of death at both 28 days and 90 days, whereas those in the DS group demonstrated a markedly reduced risk. These findings were consistent across all models. Among the models evaluated, the Logistic Regression model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, with AUC values for the 28-day mortality prediction in the training and validation sets of 0.743 and 0.732, respectively, and for 90-day mortality of 0.748 and 0.735. The key predictive factors for 28-day mortality included albumin, HGI, renal injury, and the APSIII score, while for 90-day mortality, renal injury, APSIII score, HGI, and albumin were the most influential variables. To enhance the clinical applicability of these models, nomograms for 28-day and 90-day mortality were constructed, achieving AUCs of 0.715 and 0.747, respectively. Calibration curves demonstrated strong concordance between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. CONCLUSION: Dynamic alterations in HGI during follow-up were found to be significantly associated with the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis at both 28 days and 90 days. This study presents a machine learning-based model for predicting the mortality risk of patients with sepsis, with potential clinical utility in early risk stratification and improving patient prognosis."
41105527,Construction and assessment of a predictive framework for Enterobacterales bloodstream infection in real-world adult onco-hematology patients using Lasso-Cox regression.,2025,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Enterobacterales, particularly Escherichia coli (EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), are the most prevalent infectious issues in individuals with hematologic malignancies (HM). Prognostic tools integrating pathogen-specific risks are urgently needed to optimize early clinical decision-making. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 1,299 HM patients with EC- or KP-BSI (2017-2023). Patients were randomly allocated to training (n = 909) and validation (n = 390) cohorts. Prognostic variables were selected through Lasso regression, followed by Cox proportional hazards modeling to construct a 30-day mortality prediction nomogram. Model performance was rigorously validated using receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), calibration curves, and decision-curve analysis. The cohort comprised 653 EC-BSI and 646 KP-BSI cases, predominantly with acute myeloid leukemia (54.3%). Pulmonary/skin-soft tissue infection origins, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, concurrent septic shock/pneumonia, hypoproteinemia, prolonged neutropenia before BSI, and carbapenem-resistant strains emerged as independent predictors of mortality. Conversely, tumor consolidation stage status and ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimens were predictive of survival benefit. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy (AUC 0.881), excellent calibration, and superior clinical utility. We developed a simple model using routine clinical parameters that predicts 30-day mortality in HM patients with EC- or KP-BSI, guiding therapy without complex biomarkers."
41105137,Deep learning for the identification of Candida spp. directly from blood culture gram stains from candidemia patients.,2025,"Candidemias caused by the yeasts formerly encompassed as Candida spp. require expedited identification to decide on the antifungal treatment and reduce mortality. Traditional methods rely on subcultures for diagnosis, with turnaround times of 72-96 h, or expensive equipment. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown high accuracy for image recognition in microbiology. We compared the accuracy of six CNNs (GoogLeNet, InceptionV3, AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, and DenseNet161) to identify Candida spp. at the species level, with photographs obtained mainly from clinical blood cultures showing yeast structures in the Gram stain, which were identified as Candida spp. in the subculture. Images were obtained from January 2012 to May 2024 and stored in the image databank of two third-level teaching hospitals in Mexico City. We analyzed the five most frequent species from both centers' clinical samples and included simulated blood culture images from Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and C. krusei (Pichia kudriavzevii) strains. After processing and segmentation, we loaded the CNNs with 531 whole photographs and 2804 patches. The CNN Densnet161, using a scan-based approach, showed higher accuracy identifying 87%, 99%, 94%, 100%, 89%, and 95% of the images containing C. albicans, C. auris, C. glabrata (Nakaseomyces glabrata), C. krusei (P. kudriavzevii), C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, respectively. These results show that CNN image recognition can identify clinically relevant Candida spp. directly from positive Gram-stained smears, which may help make early decisions for antifungal treatment."
41103941,Personalized ICU mortality assessment by interpretable machine learning algorithms in patients with sepsis combined lung cancer: a population-based study and an external validation cohort.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality, especially among immunocompromised patients with lung cancer. We aimed to establish machine learning (ML) based model to accurately forecast ICU mortality in patients with sepsis combined lung cancer. METHODS: We incorporated patients with sepsis combined lung cancer from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis were employed to select variables. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method based on 6 ML algorithms was used for feature selection. We harnessed 13 ML algorithms to construct prediction model, which were assessed by area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, cross-entropy and Brier scores. The best ML model was constructed to predict ICU mortality, and the predictive results were interpretated by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. RESULTS: A sum of 1096 lung cancer patients combined sepsis from MIMIC IV database and 251 patients from the external validation set were included. We utilized 13 clinical variables to establish prediction model for ICU mortality. CatBoost model was identified as the prime prediction model with the highest AUC in the training (0.931 [0.921, 0.945]), internal validation (0.698 [0.673, 0.724]) and external validation (0.794 [0.725, 0.879]) cohorts. Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) had the greatest influence on ICU mortality according to SHAP interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Our ML models demonstrate excellent accuracy and reliability, facilitating more rigorous personalized prognostic forecast to lung cancer patients combined sepsis."
41103631,A Case of Necrotizing Fasciitis in Which Interleukin-6 Measurement Helped in the Decision for Large-Scale Amputation of the Left Shoulder and Arm.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening soft tissue infection with rapid progression of necrosis. Early debridement and further surgical procedures are essential, but decision-making is often difficult. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) may serve as a valuable diagnostic parameter for monitoring the patient's state and may help in the selection of further therapeutic procedures. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old man presented with a fever and severe pain in his left elbow. Laboratory tests showed streptococcal infection, septic shock, and extremely high IL-6 levels. Intensive care, including wide-spectrum antibiotics, rapid debridement, large-scale amputation, and continuous hemodiafiltration using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA-CHDF), was performed to ensure the patient's survival. The serum IL-6 level was constantly monitored to assess the outcomes of therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time serum IL-6 levels may help assess the immune status of NF patients, guide therapeutic decisions as a part of a comprehensive evaluation, and not hesitate to amputate an extremity to save the patient's life."
41103275,Valence-Manipulated Coordination MOF-Based Probes for Multidimensional Point-of-Care Diagnosis.,2025,"Accurate diagnosis of disease is crucial for high-quality healthcare services. Biosensors based on colorimetric signals made efforts to rapidly and accurately analyze clinical biosamples. Herein, a microfluidic chip for multicategory marker diagnostics is presented as a platform for the in situ synthesis of MOF-Assisted Reduced Snowflake-like copper nanoparticles (MARS-Cu). MARS-Cu can be rapidly synthesized in 40 s at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and possesses the property of ""reversibility"" with valence manipulation. The versatile, rapid (approximately 25 min), and multicategory determination of procalcitonin and ascorbic acid using a MARS-Cu-based sensor in a microfluidic chip has been achieved for the accurate assessment of sepsis. The diagnostic accuracy of sepsis was increased from 84.3% using the procalcitonin indicator to 100% using two clinical indicators. The strategy implements ""one-chip operation"" and ""multi-category analysis"" and effectively serves as a robust tool and timely strategy for clinical diagnostics and ensuring public health safety."
41103049,Role of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signalling pathway in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a common clinical syndrome in critically ill patients, and its high mortality rate is closely related to complex pathological mechanisms. Existing studies have shown that the pathophysiological process of SA-AKI involves complex multi-mechanism interactions, including an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, abnormal microcirculatory perfusion and disturbed cellular energy metabolism. Recent studies have shown that programmed necrosis (necroptosis) mediated by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)/receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)/mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) signalling pathway plays a central role in SA-AKI, driving the deterioration of renal function by directly inducing the death of renal tubular epithelial cells, exacerbating microcirculatory disorders and amplifying inflammation. Targeted inhibition of this pathway can reduce renal injury, but clinical translation is challenged by the lack of biomarkers, off-target effects of drugs and the risk of infection. In this paper, we systematically review the molecular mechanisms of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway and its pathological contribution in SA-AKI, summarize the efficacy and limitations of the existing inhibitors and explore the potential of combined therapeutic strategies. Future studies need to integrate single-cell sequencing and clinical stratification through multidisciplinary collaboration to promote precision therapeutic breakthroughs."
41102730,Association between atherogenic index of plasma and sepsis in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke: a retrospective cohort study using propensity score and machine learning approaches.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a severe and frequent complication among ischemic stroke patients during hospitalization. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), as metabolism-related markers, are closely linked to inflammation. However, their relationship with ischemic stroke sepsis remains unclear. METHODS: We examined the potential association between sepsis and elevated AIP Levels in 1,531 ischemic stroke intensive care unit patients from the MIMIC-IV database. Logistic regression, restricted cubic splines, and propensity score matching were used to assess associations. Machine learning models were additionally applied to evaluate model performance with and without AIP and to assess its incremental value. RESULTS: Higher AIP levels were significantly associated with the development of sepsis. In the fully adjusted model, AIP (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.71) were independently associated with an increased likelihood of sepsis. Analysis showed that patients in the high AIP group (Q3) exhibited the strongest association with sepsis (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09), and this association remained robust after propensity score matching (PSM) (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.82). In machine learning models, AIP was retained as a contributing feature, and its inclusion improved model discrimination. CONCLUSION: AIP were independently associated with sepsis risk and may complement risk stratification in clinical practice."
41102440,"Metabolomics of Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury in Infants and Children: Current Challenges in Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management.",2025,"Sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in neonates, infants, and children. This comprehensive review aimed to evaluate the application of metabolomics in the challenging diagnostic process of sepsis and AKI in neonatal and pediatric populations. We highlighted the role of metabolomic profiling in enabling the accurate identification of biomarkers associated with sepsis and AKI, allowing for the timely prevention or detection of the disease. Additionally, pharmacometabolomics was presented to ascertain the contribution of metabolomics towards optimizing an individual's drug therapy via direct measurement and monitoring of drug metabolites to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug compounds. This review also addressed the obstacles in translating metabolomic research into clinical practice, including the need for standardized methodologies, age-specific reference data, and large-scale validation studies as a result of the current limited literature in this area. Ultimately, the review showcased how utilizing metabolomics-driven diagnostic and treatment guidelines can promote positive clinical outcomes in infants and children affected by sepsis-associated AKI."
41101747,Prognostic significance of serum Mrp 8/14 in acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by pulmonary and extrapulmonary sepsis: A retrospective controlled study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To date, it remains unclear whether serum Mrp 8/14 is differentially expressed in sepsis-induced ARDS patients of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin during ICU hospitalization. This study investigated the association between serum Mrp 8/14 and clinical outcomes in sepsis-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted involving 153 septic patients who developed ARDS during their ICU stay, resulting from either pulmonary or extrapulmonary infections. The enrolled patients were further stratified into survivor and non-survivor groups based on ICU mortality. MAIN FINDINGS: The serum Mrp 8/14 on the first day of ICU admission was detected. The expression of serum Mrp 8/14 in pulmonary ARDS was 15.91 (10.32, 23.48)ug/ml, which was significantly higher compared to that of the extrapulmonary ARDS at 9.51 (4.55, 16.98)ug/ml (p = 0.000). The logistic regression analysis revealed that serum Mrp 8/14 was the independent factor associated with the mortality in sepsis-induced pulmonary ARDS (OR = 1.223, 95 % CI 1.105-1.375, p = 0.000). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for serum Mrp 8/14 was associated with ICU mortality in patients with pulmonary ARDS (AUC = 0.872, 95 %CI 0.798-0.947, p = 0.000). The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated a significantly higher survival rate among pulmonary ARDS patients with serum Mrp 8/14 levels below 19.23 mug/ml compared to those with serum Mrp 8/14 levels above this threshold (HR = 3.480, 95 % CI = 1.819-6.659, p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Serum Mrp 8/14 levels upon ICU admission may serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for predicting the mortality in patients with sepsis-induced pulmonary ARDS during ICU hospitalization."
41101140,What every intensivist should know about the biphasic kinetics of lactate in septic shock.,2026,"Lactate is a central biomarker in septic shock, but its interpretation requires understanding its biphasic kinetics. In survivors, lactate clearance typically follows two phases: an initial 6-12 h, predominantly flow-dependent phase, where elevated levels reflect tissue hypoperfusion and improve with restoration of oxygen delivery via fluids, vasopressors, or correction of hypoxemia; and a later phase (>12 h), where persistent hyperlactatemia more often reflects metabolic reprogramming, immune activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction rather than ongoing hypoperfusion. Clinical and experimental data suggest that hyperlactatemia must be contextualized: severe systolic dysfunction may impair clearance despite restored flow, while excessive beta-stimulation (particularly epinephrine) can elevate lactate without metabolic shift. Observational studies demonstrate that persistent hyperlactatemia with a hypoperfusion context (e.g., abnormal CRT, low ScvO(2), or elevated P(cv-a)CO(2)) carries worse outcomes, whereas persistent hyperlactatemia without hypoperfusion may be misleading and should not drive further resuscitation. The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial validated this concept, showing that CRT-guided resuscitation improved outcomes compared with lactate-guided therapy, highlighting the risk of overintervention. Emerging biomarkers such as lactylation, transcriptomic signatures, and metabolomic profiles may help identify transitions to the metabolic phase, expanding therapeutic opportunities. Lactate should therefore be interpreted as both a hemodynamic and metabolic biomarker, integrated with perfusion indices to guide escalation, timely deescalation, and potential adjunctive interventions in septic shock."
41098681,"Combined Biomarker Panel of Presepsin, HE4, and Oxygenation Index for Sepsis Diagnosis and Prognosis in Intensive Care Unit Patients.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a lethal global health crisis with persistently high mortality, exacerbated by diagnostic challenges stemming from its heterogeneous clinical presentation and limitations of current diagnostic tools like SOFA score. While biomarkers such as Presepsin or human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) show promise, single-marker approaches exhibit insufficient accuracy for reliable early detection and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of Presepsin, HE4, Oxygenation Index (OI), and their combined panel (PHO) in critically ill patients with or without sepsis. METHODS: This single-center study analyzed 411 ICU patients (165 non-sepsis, 246 sepsis or septic shock). Clinical parameters-including SOFA, and OI-alongside laboratory parameters (hematological indices, hepatic/renal function markers, inflammatory biomarkers, blood culture results) were extracted from the hospital's Laboratory Information System. Residual admission samples were used to quantify Presepsin and HE4. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Spearman's rank correlation, and gradient boosting machine learning models were employed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance. RESULTS: Presepsin, HE4, and OI were significantly elevated in septic patients compared to controls (all P < 0.05) and correlated strongly with 30-day mortality. The gradient boosting algorithm identified these three markers as the most significant predictors. Importantly, the combined biomarker panel PHO demonstrated superior performance in both diagnosis and prognosis. For sepsis diagnosis, PHO achieved an outstanding AUC of 0.892 (95% CI: 0.860-0.924), significantly outperforming individual biomarkers (Presepsin: 0.821; HE4: 0.803; OI: 0.752) and conventional inflammatory markers (all P<0.05). For mortality prediction, PHO maintained the highest prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.706, 95% CI: 0.641-0.772), with improved sensitivity and specificity compared to single biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The combined Presepsin, HE4 and OI biomarker panel significantly outperforms individual markers in sepsis diagnosis and prognosis. This machine learning-validated composite indicator enables early risk stratification and may guide timely interventions to improve outcomes."
41098209,Relationship Between Phenotyping and Individualized Absolute Risk Differences in Sepsis: A Secondary Analysis of Two Approaches in Two Multicenter Trials.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis trials likely include patients who vary in response to therapeutic interventions. The optimal approach to identify such differences in treatment response remains unclear. Estimating individualized absolute risk differences (iARDs) to model treatment response at an individual patient level using supervised effect models applied to randomized trial data may be informative. We explored the relationship between two subgrouping approaches and a recently published iARD model for the effect of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) resuscitation in sepsis. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) and Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trials. We applied clinical subtypes (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) to 829 ProCESS and 1588 ARISE patients and biologic ""hyperinflammatory"" and ""nonhyperinflammatory"" subphenotypes to 363 ProCESS patients with biomarker data using established methods. We predicted iARDs with supervised learning using clinical variables as predictors and 90-day mortality as the primary outcome. We evaluated iARD variability within subgroups. SETTING: Eighty-one sites worldwide. PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Adults with septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: EGDT or usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The average treatment effect of EGDT appeared to vary within both clinical and biologic subphenotypes. EGDT appeared potentially beneficial in the beta and nonhyperinflammatory subphenotypes but harmful in the gamma and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. However, the predicted iARDs within each subgroup ranged from considerable harm to considerable benefit. For example, for the beta-subtype, the average mortality reduction from EGDT was 8.5% (95% CI, -0.4 to 17.5), but the iARDs ranged from a 29% increase to a 16% reduction in mortality, with 39% of patients predicted to be harmed. CONCLUSIONS: Although both clinical and biologic phenotyping may identify subgroups whose average treatment effect is beneficial or harmful, individual risks and benefits within subgroups still vary dramatically, raising concern that phenotyping may not reliably or safely personalize sepsis care."
41096721,Early Use of Innovative Biomarkers Such as Mid-Regional Pro-Adrenomedullin and SeptiCyte((R)) RAPID in Post-Cardiac Surgery Patients: Pilot Case Series.,2025,"Prognostic uncertainty and missed diagnoses of sepsis remain frequent after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, where systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) arises from surgical trauma, blood activation in the extracorporeal circuit, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and endotoxin release. Among innovative biomarkers, pro-adrenomedullin (pro-ADM), particularly its stable fragment mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), has shown promise for detecting endothelial dysfunction and predicting organ failure in sepsis. SeptiCyte((R)) RAPID (Seattle, WA, USA) also represents a novel diagnostic tool that assesses the host immune response by quantifying PLA2G7 and PLAC8 gene expression in whole blood, offering potential for early differentiation between sepsis and sterile inflammation. We analyzed traditional and innovative biomarkers within 24 h post-CPB in a pilot group of patients admitted to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit of the ""Citta della Salute e della Scienza"" University Hospital (Turin, Italy) between June and November 2023. Data from the following 14 patients were collected: 7 undergoing surgery for infective endocarditis (IE, Group 1) and 7 having standard elective cardiac surgery (Group 2). Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate, and pro-ADM increased in Group 1 but not in Group 2. SeptiCyte((R)) RAPID showed a moderate, borderline increase in Group 1. The innovative biomarkers had a good performance in patients exhibiting signs of organ dysfunction and in subjects demonstrating at least cardiovascular and/or pulmonary damage and under vasopressor and inotropic support. Although limited by the small sample, our preliminary data suggest no biomarker alterations in patients with standard elective cardiac surgery, unlike in those with IE."
41096182,The Role of Inflammasomes in LPS and Gram-Negative Bacterial Sepsis.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an uncontrolled immune response due to systemic infections. It is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Although inflammasomes play an important role in host defense, they have a detrimental role in sepsis induced by LPS or Gram-negative bacteria. We aimed to revise the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation in sepsis by LPS and Gram-negative bacteria other than cytokine release as treatments blocking TNF-alpha and IL-1 cytokines have been ineffective even though cytokine storm is associated with lethality. Results: Studies with knockout mice deficient in inflammasome-derived cytokines have shown contrasting results on the role of these proinflammatory cytokines in the lethality of LPS- and Gram-negative-induced sepsis. However, DAMPs released after non-canonical inflammasome activation such as extracellular DNA, histones, HMGB1, and tissue factor result in disseminated-intravascular coagulation (DIC) and mortality in mice. Blocking these products in preclinical studies with animal models showed improved clinical scores and survival after LPS-induced sepsis or polymicrobial sepsis induced by Cecal Ligation and Puncture. Conclusions: Even though immunomodulatory drugs have shown inconclusive results as therapies for sepsis, blocking DAMPs associated with DIC may be considered for clinical trials in the future, especially in patients presenting biomarkers of coagulopathies."
41096051,Presepsin as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker of Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: A Scoping Review of Clinical Evidence.,2025,"Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome associated with high morbidity and mortality and organ dysfunction, most notably acute kidney injury. Early recognition determines crucial clinical decisions for septic individuals. This rapid diagnosis depends on the accuracy of biomarkers in the context of coexisting renal dysfunction. In this context, the value of presepsin has been investigated and challenged for a decade, with no definitive answers. This scoping review aims to evaluate the existing evidence regarding the accuracy of presepsin as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). We obtained 130 articles by searching for references in databases (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus) following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Sequential selection by three independent readers resulted in nine references retained for full analysis. Presepsin demonstrated good diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in patients with AKI, based on observations in small patient groups; however, it requires specific cutoff values, whose determination depends on new controlled and randomized studies."
41095845,Investigation of the Prognostic Value of Novel Laboratory Indices in Patients with Sepsis in an Intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective Observational Study.,2025,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of some novel laboratory indices in intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized sepsis patients. Methods: This retrospective, observational study included 400 patients with sepsis. The indices studied were the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), hemoglobin, albumin lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score, lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), systemic immune inflammatory index (SII), vitamin B12xC-reactive protein index (BCI), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The predicting effects of these indices in ICU mortality, along with other clinical outcomes, were investigated. Results: The median age of the study population was 73 (18-95) years and 51.6% were males. The ICU mortality rate was 51.7%. Deceased patients with sepsis had an increased age and high APACHE II and SOFA scores compared to the survivors (p < 0.05 for all). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (HR = 1.069, p = 0.038 in Model 1 vs. HR = 1.053, p = 0.001 in Model 2), SOFA score (HR = 2.145, p < 0.001 in Model 1 vs. HR = 1.740, p < 0.001 in Model 2), phosphorus levels (in Model 1, HR = 0.608, p = 0.037), and CAR (in Model 2, HR = 1.012, p = 0.023) were independent associated factors for ICU mortality. According to the ROC analyses, the SOFA (AUC = 0.879, p < 0.001) and APACHE II (AUC = 0.769, p < 0.001) scores showed high accuracy in predicting ICU mortality, while the PNI (AUC = 0.675, p < 0.001), CAR (AUC = 0.609, p < 0.001), and the BCI (AUC = 0.648, p < 0.001) showed limited accuracy. However, the HALP score did not reach a significant level in predicting ICU mortality (p = 0.067). Conclusions: Excluding the HALP score, the new laboratory indices mentioned above may be prognostic markers for predicting clinical outcomes in intensive care units for patients with sepsis. However, these indices need to be supported by larger patient populations."
41095831,Artificial Intelligence in Predictive Healthcare: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Today, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) significantly enhance predictive analytics in the healthcare landscape, enabling timely and accurate predictions that lead to proactive interventions, personalized treatment plans, and ultimately improved patient care. As healthcare systems increasingly adopt data-driven approaches, the integration of AI and data analysis has garnered substantial interest, as reflected in the growing number of publications highlighting innovative applications of AI in clinical settings. This review synthesizes recent evidence on application areas, commonly used models, metrics, and challenges. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review between using Web of Science and Google Scholar databases from 2021-2025 covering a diverse range of AI and ML techniques applied to disease prediction. Results: Twenty-two studies met criteria. The most frequently used machine learning approaches were tree-based ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) for structured clinical data, and deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM) for imaging and time-series tasks. Evaluation most commonly relied on AUROC, F1-score, accuracy, and sensitivity. key challenges remain regarding data privacy, integration with clinical workflows, model interpretability, and the necessity for high-quality representative datasets. Conclusions: Future research should focus on developing interpretable models that clinicians can understand and trust, implementing robust privacy-preserving techniques to safeguard patient data, and establishing standardized evaluation frameworks to effectively assess model performance."
41095771,The Burden of Sepsis and Septic Shock in the Intensive Care Unit.,2025,"This narrative review synthesizes our current understanding of sepsis and septic shock burden in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Based on a comprehensive but non-systematic literature search from 2000 to 2025, this review synthesizes our current understanding across eight key domains: epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostics, management strategies, long-term outcomes, disparities, and future directions. The global burden of sepsis, especially in the developed and developing world, is great: over 48 million cases per year, with mortality rates at the ICU level in the range of 30 to 50%, depending on geography and resources. The pathophysiological progression from an initial hyper-inflammatory state to immune paralysis underlies organ failure and complicates therapeutic targeting. Diagnostic approaches, including clinical scoring systems, biomarkers (e.g., procalcitonin, MR-proADM), and emerging AI tools, offer improved early detection but face challenges in reliability and accessibility. Management in the ICU remains anchored in timely antimicrobial administration, hemodynamic stabilization with balanced fluids and vasopressors, source control, and organ support, including lung-protective ventilation and kidney replacement therapy. Novel adjuncts, such as immunomodulators and extracorporeal therapies, show promise but demand further validation. Importantly, survivors face significant long-term sequelae-post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)-encompassing physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments, which require structured rehabilitation and follow-up. The future of sepsis care lies in integrating precision medicine-through molecular diagnostics, individualized immunotherapy, and AI-supported monitoring-with scalable, equitable implementation strategies that bridge the gap between high- and low-income settings. Addressing disparities and expanding rehabilitation services are essential to improving survival and long-term quality of life in sepsis survivors."
41094486,Development of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting prolonged hospital stay in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Prolonged hospital stay in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare resource allocation. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for forecasting prolonged hospital stays of the AECOPD population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV database on patients diagnosed with AECOPD. The dataset was split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). Feature selection was executed through LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm. Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), naive Bayes (NB), as well as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were constructed based on the selected features. Model performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration and decision curves. The interpretability of the optimal model was enhanced through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. RESULTS: 7,373 AECOPD patients were encompassed. The final model incorporated the following features: hemoglobin, platelet count, anion gap, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), potassium, chloride, antibiotic use, invasive ventilation, vasopressor use, SOFA, body temperature(Tb), heart rate(HR), acute kidney injury (AKI), as well as sepsis. The RF model demonstrated the best predictive performance, with an area of the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.817 in the training set and 0.715 in the validation set, along with good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis further enhanced the interpretability of the model, providing valuable clinical decision support. CONCLUSION: The RF model developed in our study exhibited excellent performance in predicting prolonged hospital stays in AECOPD patients. The incorporation of interpretability analysis improved the transparency and reliability of its clinical application. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

41091754,Evaluation of GDH and HDP as novel serological biomarkers for Plasmodium falciparum malaria diagnosis across varying parasitemia and transmission settings in India.,2025,"Malaria diagnosis has progressed significantly with the introduction of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) targeting Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (HRP2), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase. However, challenges remain, such as the presence of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene deletions and reduced sensitivity in regions with low parasitemia. This study evaluates antibody responses to novel biomarkers-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and Heam detoxification protein (HDP)-in comparison to conventional antigens (HRP2, LDH, and aldolase) across different infection, transmission settings, and parasitemia conditions. We analyzed plasma samples from 928 participants, including 886 P. falciparum-positive cases, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results revealed antibody levels against all studied peptides clear differentiation between malaria-positive and negative samples, with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showing high diagnostic accuracy (Area under the ROC curve > 96%) for detecting P. falciparum infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between endemicity or parasitemia groups were limited for certain peptides. Specifically, GDH2 and HRP2 effectively distinguished parasitemia levels, while GDH2, HDP2, and LDH showed promise in distinguishing between varying endemicity levels. These findings suggest that GDH and HDP have significant potential as reliable serological biomarkers for malaria detection. However, further studies are needed to refine their application in categorizing endemicity and parasitemia. This research highlights the need for adaptable diagnostic tools to address the complex challenges of malaria in endemic regions."
41090119,Serum small RNA profiling identifies prognostic biomarkers for sepsis mortality prediction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients, with current prognostic tools showing limited accuracy for outcome prediction. While traditional clinical parameters and inflammatory biomarkers provide some prognostic information, there is an urgent need for novel molecular biomarkers that can accurately predict sepsis outcomes to guide clinical decision-making and therapeutic interventions. Circulating small RNAs, including tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), have emerged as potential biomarkers due to their stability in circulation and regulatory roles in immune responses and inflammatory processes. METHODS: This study enrolled 26 sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit, who were stratified into recovery (n = 17) and death (n = 9) groups based on clinical outcomes. Comprehensive clinical parameters including demographic characteristics, severity scores, inflammatory markers, organ function indicators, metabolic parameters, and acid-base balance were analyzed. Serum samples underwent optimized small RNA profiling using high-throughput sequencing with de-modification protocols to enhance tsRNA and miRNA detection. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify outcome-associated small RNAs, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to evaluate diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers and combined panels. RESULTS: Traditional clinical parameters showed limited prognostic value, with only specific markers including SOFA scores, procalcitonin, interferon-gamma, glucose levels, and acid-base parameters demonstrating significant associations with outcomes. Small RNA profiling revealed 22 differentially expressed tsRNAs (12 downregulated, 10 upregulated) and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs (3 downregulated, 2 upregulated) in the death group compared to the recovery group. Individual biomarkers showed substantial discriminatory power, with top-performing tsRNAs achieving AUCs of 0.827-0.837 and miRNAs reaching AUCs of 0.797-0.850. Notably, combined biomarker panels demonstrated exceptional diagnostic performance, with the tsRNA signature achieving an AUC of 0.967 and the miRNA panel reaching an AUC of 0.902. CONCLUSION: This study identifies circulating small RNAs as highly promising novel biomarkers for sepsis outcome prediction, substantially outperforming traditional clinical parameters. The exceptional diagnostic accuracy of combined tsRNA and miRNA signatures suggests significant potential for clinical translation to improve sepsis prognosis and patient stratification. These findings provide a foundation for developing molecular-based prognostic tools that could enhance sepsis management and guide therapeutic decision-making in critically ill patients."
41089329,Machine learning-based identification of leptin-associated biomarkers and prognostic prediction models in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Leptin has been implicated in the prognosis of sepsis, yet its mechanistic role remains unclear. This study aimed to develop leptin-associated diagnostic and prognostic models for sepsis and identify potential biomarkers using machine learning approaches. METHODS: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to identify leptin-related molecular subtypes of sepsis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) determined relevant gene modules and hub genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis patients and controls were intersected with WGCNA results to refine key genes. Based on these analyses, a prognostic classification model predicting 28-day mortality was developed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest algorithms, while a time-to-event prognostic model was constructed with Random Survival Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to assess expression patterns of core genes across immune cell types. Expression validation was conducted using qPCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Three leptin-associated sepsis subtypes with distinct prognoses were identified. The pink and salmon modules from WGCNA were significantly associated with sepsis. Seventy core genes were selected from the DEGs and WGCNA intersection. The prognostic classification model and the time-to-event prognostic model demonstrated strong predictive performance in both the training and external validation cohorts. TFRC and PILRA were consistently highlighted through machine learning, single-cell data, and experimental validation as potential biomarkers. CONCLUSION: We established leptin-related prognostic models for sepsis using integrated machine learning. TFRC and PILRA may serve as promising biomarkers, offering insights into sepsis heterogeneity and clinical management."
41088618,The role of machine learning methods in assessing the risk of neonatal sepsis: A study of biochemical markers and genetic variants.,2025,"Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects neonates, and its morbidity and mortality rates remain high. There is currently no effective method for timely diagnosis and prevention of neonatal sepsis. Using machine learning techniques, we aimed to analyze the risk factors of neonatal sepsis, including biochemical indicators and genetic variants. We collected data from 107 neonates, 56 of whom were in the sepsis cohort and 51 were not. We classified the data using support vector machine and random forest models and evaluated model performance and feature significance. PCT (Procalcitonin level), WBC (white blood cell count), and IL-6 (interleukin-6 level) were the characteristics most strongly associated with sepsis risk. We analyzed the association between genetic variants in CRP (C-reactive protein) and IL-10 and biochemical markers using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test. CRP gene variants were significantly associated with CRP levels, whereas IL-10 gene variants were substantially distinct from Hb (hemoglobin) levels. These findings shed light on potential biomarkers and genetic correlates of neonatal sepsis, which will inform future clinical diagnosis and treatment."
41088240,Combination of antithrombin and soluble thrombomodulin for early prediction of sepsis-Induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To identify early diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation, we investigated the relationship between the novel coagulation biomarkers and antithrombin with the development of Disseminated intravascular coagulation post-admission, as well as the prognosis of patients with sepsis. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from septic patients admitted to the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) of a teaching hospital between October 2021 and September 2023. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the performance of the predictive model. In addition, non-parametric bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications was conducted to evaluate the internal stability and empirical power of the predictive models, particularly given the limited sample size. RESULTS: Among 91 septic patients, 15 were diagnosed with DIC. Soluble thrombomodulin (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.033-1.586, P = 0.024) and antithrombin activity (OR: 0.887, 95% CI: 0.792-0.994, P = 0.039) were identified as independent risk factors for the development of DIC in septic patients. The area under the curve (AUC) for soluble thrombomodulin and antithrombin was 0.788 and 0.757, respectively. When combined, the AUC increased to 0.858. Prothrombin Time (HR: 1.058, 95% CI: 1.016-1.102, P = 0.007) and APACHE II score (HR: 1.071, 95% CI: 1.005-1.141, P = 0.035) were identified as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in septic patients. When combined, the AUC increased to 0.834. Bootstrap validation demonstrated strong discriminatory performance of both models, with a mean bootstrap AUC of 0.865 (empirical power = 0.994) for the DIC prediction model, and 0.836 (empirical power = 0.996) for the 28-day mortality model, further supporting the robustness and reliability of the findings despite the small sample size. CONCLUSION: Elevated soluble thrombomodulin and decreased antithrombin may be associated with the early onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation in sepsis, but showed limited predictive value for 28-day mortality."
41088210,The role of four ERS-related key genes in sepsis induced organ dysfunction and the forewarning model construction.,2025,"BAKGROUND: Sepsis/septic shock frequently occurred as a lethal complication in the intensive care unit. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) leading to the disturbance of cellular proteostasis played an important role in the sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction. Previous studies showed that several ERS molecule were involved in. It is not clear which ERS molecule could be competent as prognostic indicators of sepsis. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets containing gene expression profiles of sepsis patients and healthy controls were downloaded from the GEO database. Consensus clustering was performed to identify sepsis molecular subtypes associated with ERS. An integrated machine learning approach was conducted to screen potential prognostic markers for sepsis. RESULTS: The overactivated ERS-related sepsis subgroup were identified according to higher APACHE II scores and poor prognosis. Further molecular characterization and immune function analysis of this subgroup revealed that overactivated ERS-related sepsis was linked to excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, inflammatory response and pronounced immunosuppression. AHSP, FIS1, REXO2 and SYF2 were identified as key prognostic markers for this sepsis subtype. Their expressions following sepsis and their role in the severity of sepsis were validated by in vivo experiments. Furthermore, a prognostic risk model with the four genes was established as an independent and superior prognostic indicator, outperforming APACHE IV score and cardiovascular insufficiency in predicting outcome for septic patients. CONCLUSION: In summary, four ERS-related genes play an important role in sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, and the ERS-related prognostic model shows great potential as a major forewarning model."
41087479,Understanding the regulatory grammar of sepsis-causing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria using contexualised DNA language models.,2025,"To efficiently and accurately understand, detect, and treat sepsis, we require a deep understanding of how its underlying biological systems work. Conventional methods struggle to provide a detailed view of both the functional and regulatory elements orchestrating a system-wide response to pathogenic infection. Our approach was to use a streamlined process: First, we used multi-omics integration to create a functional-omics signature at the single molecule level, employing sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLSDA). Then, we turned to genome Natural Language Processing (genomeNLP) to identify correlated features and discover regulatory motifs in bacterial promoters. This novel method utilised specialised language models trained on DNA sequences. Our approach is distinct from traditional methods as we did not rely on predefined biomarkers and motifs or focus solely on short-range context. As a result, we (a) pinpointed multi-omics signatures with single molecule-level precision and (b) uncovered regulatory patterns for both novel and established regulatory motifs governing the omics signature. Ultimately, we presented a comprehensive systems-level view of five sepsis-causing Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains, revealing hierarchical gene regulation in genome structure, ncRNA control, metabolism, and antibiotic resistance. We additionally note that our approach is agnostic to organism type and can be applied outside of a sepsis system."
41086542,Assessing B19V epidemiology and viremia dynamics in plasma donors: A comprehensive analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection is characterized by measurable bloodstream biomarkers, which vary over time indicating different phases of infection. High B19V DNA levels in the bloodstream are associated with infectivity, impacting the eligibility of source plasma donors. OBJECTIVES: Characterize temporal changes in B19V epidemiological rates from January 2018 to April 2025 and to investigate the longitudinal dynamics of the diagnostic biomarkers and infectivity in subclinical infections among US source plasma donors. RESULTS: B19V positivity rates in CSL's US source plasma donors decreased to a very low level during the COVID-19 pandemic and until Spring 2023 and re-emerged in two waves with peak rates >/= 2.2-fold higher compared to pre-COVID data (2018 - 2020). During the exponential infection phase, B19V DNA doubled every 3-5 h, leading to high titers up to 10;12 IU/mL and peak infectivity of  approximately 10;8 TCID(50)/mL. Infectivity ceased when anti-B19V IgG reached a plateau or 14 days after DNA titer dropped below 4.8 x 10;5 IU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The re-emergence of B19V with high positivity rates highlights the relevance of donation testing for plasma. During the month from infection onset, B19V DNAemia correlates well with the measured infectious titer. B19V infectivity in plasma disappears within a month while DNA can persist in the plasma in absence of detectable infectivity, likely due to the immune response as characterized by the immunological markers."
41086016,Role of high-mobility group box 1 in late onset neonatal sepsis.,2025,"Neonatal sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. High mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1) is a cytokine that can mediate inflammation. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of HMGB1 in diagnosis and prognosis of late onset neonatal sepsis. This observational case-control study included 80 newborn infants >/=37 weeks of gestation. Newborn infants were assigned into two groups: the late-onset neonatal septic group included 40 infant cases, and the control group included 40 newborn infants. Clinical sepsis score, hematological sepsis score and serum level of C-reactive protein were assessed and blood culture performed. HMGB1 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was a significant increase of HMGB1 in the late-onset neonatal septic group than the control group (p < 0. 001). The best cut off point of HMGB 1 to discriminate against the late-onset sepsis cases from the control newborn infants was > 68 ng/ml with a sensitivity of 97.5%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 95.1% and negative predictive value of 97.4% with total accuracy of 0.99%. The values of HMGB1 were not affected by gestational age, birth weight, postnatal age or gender. There were no significant differences in mean values between survival and non-survival cases. The best cut off value to predict mortality in the late onset sepsis group was >167.8 ng/ml with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 54.29%. In conclusion, this study suggested that HMGB1 is a promising marker for diagnosis of late onset neonatal sepsis in full term infants, on the contrary HMGB1 could not predict mortality in neonatal septic patients."
41085973,Evaluation of serum amyloid-A protein in the diagnosis of sepsis among children at PICU of Al Zahraa University Hospital.,2025,"The early and efficient diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill children remains a difficult task as the clinical signs are nonspecific. Complete blood count parameters and C‑reactive protein have low sensitivity., Also, the difficulty of its diagnosis may be due to decreased positive values of blood culture and the need for longtime to detect blood culture results. The serum Amyloid A (SAA) protein level in the blood increases earlier and up to 1000‑fold in response to inflammation. This study aimed to assess the role of SAA as diagnostic and prognostic marker in pediatric sepsis in the first 24 hours after pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. This case-control study included 45 children with sepsis admitted at PICU from May 2023 to March 2024 and 45 children with matched age and sex as controls. We investigated SAA level in the same time with routine laboratory investigations of both groups. SAA level was higher in the patient group, ranged from 0.9 to 47.2 microg/m, with median 4.54 microg/ml, as compared to the control group with median 0.58 microg/ml ranged from 0 to 2.3 microg/ml. (p </=0.001). Also, SAA level was significantly lower in the survived group with median 13.6 microg/ml, ranged from 5.7 to 20 microg/ml than the non-survived group with a median of 32.3 microg/ml; ranged from 30.3 to 47.2 microg/ml. In conclusion, we found that SAA was extremely high in critical and extremely critical ill patients which can be used as a predictor of mortality in severe sepsis among children."
41085956,Physical Activity and BrainAGE: Exploring the Impact on Brain Health and Plasticity in Older Adults.,2025,"With an aging global population, cognitive decline in older adults presents significant healthcare challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that physical activity can support cognitive health by promoting plasticity, functional reorganization, and structural adaptation of the brain. In the FIT4BRAIN study, we examined the effects of multi-component physical activity on cognitive and brain health. Here, we report the results on one of the secondary outcomes, namely changes in brain age (BrainAGE), which estimates the difference between chronological and predicted brain age based on structural MRI data, and changes in brain structure, assessed through voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Ninety-two healthy older adults were randomized into a multi-component physical activity group, performing aerobic, coordination, and balance exercises, or an active control group engaging in non-aerobic relaxation exercises and educational content (physical activity group (PAG): 36 participants; active control group (CON): 33 participants). Of these, 69 participants underwent MRI assessment and were included in the present analyses. BrainAGE analyses revealed a greater decrease in the physical activity group compared to the control group, indicating a beneficial effect of physical activity on brain aging. Subgroup analyses based on baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) further revealed that participants with lower CRF showed greater benefits, consistent with VBM findings of structural changes in the same subgroup. These results underscore BrainAGE as a sensitive biomarker for intervention outcomes and suggest that stratification by baseline fitness level may help identify differences in the benefits of physical activity on brain health."
41085943,"The Roles of Histone H3K18 Lactylation, Acetylation, and Lactylation/Acetylation Ratio as Potential Biomarkers in the Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of Sepsis and Septic Shock.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: The complex pathophysiology and diverse clinical manifestations of sepsis and septic shock continue to make early diagnosis and severity assessment challenging. Previous studies revealed the distinct roles of histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) and H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) in infection. However, the functions and interactions of these modifications remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and roles of H3K18la and H3K18ac in patients with sepsis and septic shock. METHODS: This ambispective cohort study enrolled 86 critically ill patients (13 sepsis, 37 septic shock, and 36 noninfectious) and 12 healthy volunteers. Baseline information and laboratory data were collected. H3K18la and H3K18ac levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected via Western blotting. Serum cytokines, arginase-1 (ARG1), and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) mRNA were assayed via microsphere immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The potential value of H3K18la, H3K18ac, and their ratio (H3K18la/ac) in the diagnosis and severity assessment was analyzed using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the noninfectious group, the infectious group presented increased H3K18la and H3K18la/ac and decreased H3K18ac levels, with H3K18la/ac as an independent diagnosis biomarker. Compared with the sepsis group, the septic shock group presented higher H3K18la and H3K18la/ac and lower H3K18ac levels. H3K18la and H3K18la/ac levels correlated positively with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mechanical ventilation time. H3K18ac levels correlated negatively with SOFA scores and mechanical ventilation time. H3K18la levels correlated negatively with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interleukin‑5 (IL‑5) and positively with IL-10 expression. H3K18ac levels correlated negatively with IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-10 expression. H3K18la/ac levels correlated negatively with IFN-alpha and IL-5 and positively with IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 expression. H3K18la and H3K18la/ac correlated positively, whereas H3K18ac correlated negatively with ARG1 and KLF4 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: H3K18la, H3K18ac, and H3K18la/ac can serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and severity assessment of sepsis and septic shock through their involvement in inflammatory responses and macrophage polarization, thereby informing targeted therapies to modulate immune responses and improve patient outcomes."
41085233,Neutrophil CD11b and serum procalcitonin as promising markers for early detection of neonatal sepsis.,2025,"Although many biomarkers were used for diagnosing neonatal sepsis, none of them is conclusive alone. So, measuring multiple biomarkers were proposed to help in rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. This study aimed to assess the potential role of measurement of neutrophil CD11b and serum procalcitonin (PCT) for early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. This was a case control study, included 96 neonates admitted to Ain Shams University hospital. The neonates were divided into 3 Groups: Group A included proven sepsis Group with positive blood cultures (n=31), Group B, suspected Group with persistent clinical signs of sepsis but with negative blood cultures (n=36) and a control Group of normal newborns of matched age and sex (n=29). There was a statistically significant increase in expression of CD11b on neutrophils in Group A (median= 99.7) when compared with that of Group B (median= 99.4) and the control Group (median= 96.2) (p < 0.001), with increased mean fluorescence intensity in Group A (median= 21.3) when compared with that of Group B (median= 10.1) and control Group (median= 4.1) (p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic performance of the tested markers. It showed that the serum PCT level can be used to discriminate between Group A and the control Group with 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity and CD 11b showed 100% sensitivity, 69% specificity. Moreover, to discriminate between Group A and Group B serum PCT showed 100% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity and CD 11b showed 87.1% sensitivity and 44.4% specificity. In conclusion, PCT and neutrophil CD11b are promising markers for diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis in preterm neonate."
41082207,Derivation and Validation of Predictive Models for Early Pediatric Sepsis.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: Sepsis is a leading cause of death in children. Early recognition and treatment improve outcomes, but predictive models have not to date improved early diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models to estimate the probability of developing sepsis in the subsequent 48 hours. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multisite registry for model derivation and validation using electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2016 through February 2020 and temporal validation from January 2021 through December 2022. The performance of machine learning algorithms was compared to predict development of sepsis and septic shock via logistic regression, specifically ridge regression and gradient tree boosting. Five health systems contributing to the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network were included. Emergency department (ED) visits for children aged 2 months or older to less than 18 years of age excluding patients with ED disposition of death or transfer, trauma diagnosis, or sepsis present during predictive features window. The TRIPOD-AI reporting guideline was followed, and data analysis was conducted from September 2023 to July 2025. EXPOSURES: Patient and physiologic characteristics within the first 4 hours of ED care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sepsis, defined as suspected infection with a Phoenix Sepsis Criteria (PSC) score of 2 or more or death within 48 hours of ED arrival. RESULTS: The dataset included 1 604 422 eligible visits in the training cohort and 719 298 visits in the test cohort. Performance characteristics for the PSC sepsis prediction models were AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.92-0.93) for logistic regression and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) for gradient tree boosting. AUROCs for PSC shock models were 0.92 or greater. The gradient tree boosting models had positive likelihood ratios ranging from 4.67 (95% CI, 4.61-4.74) to 6.18 (95% CI, 6.08-6.28) for sepsis and from 4.16 (95% CI, 4.07-4.24) to 5.83 (95% CI, 5.67-5.99) for septic shock. Predictive features included emergency severity index, age-adjusted vital signs, and medical complexity. Assessment of model performance fairness was similar for all demographic characteristics except payor; AUROC for patients with Medicaid insurance was better than for those with commercial payers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a large multicenter population, models were developed and validated with high AUROC to predict the future development of sepsis based on EHR data collected in the ED. The models achieved positive likelihood ratios to predict sepsis and septic shock. The results highlight the opportunity for future studies that combine EHR-based models with clinical judgment to improve prediction."
41081959,RAPGEF6 is a key biomarker with temporal characteristics in sepsis and exacerbates inflammation and oxidative stress by NF-kappaB-mediated necroptosis.,2025,"Biomarkers identified through integrated bioinformatics approaches often exhibit limited temporal stability during sepsis progression. To address this limitation, temporal changes in the serum transcriptome of sepsis patients were analyzed at multiple time points to investigate underlying pathological mechanisms. The datasets GSE54514 and GSE212092 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were used for gene identification and validation. The key marker RAPGEF6 with temporal characteristics was identified by integrating time-series clustering analysis, differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and single-cell data analysis. Stable RAPGEF6-knockdown RAW264.7 macrophages were generated using lentiviral shRNA delivery to investigate the role of RAPGEF6 in sepsis. A total of 2,701 genes showed time-associated expression patterns during sepsis progression. Integrative analysis combining differential expression and WGCNA-derived modules identified three hub genes: RAPGEF6, CHD9, and POGULT1. RAPGEF6 showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9206 (95% CI: 0.8383-1). Immune infiltration analysis indicated that RAPGEF6 had the strongest correlation with M1 macrophages (correlation coefficient = 0.42). The analysis of single-cell data targeting key genes and external experiments confirmed this finding. RAPGEF6 expression in macrophages increased during the early phase of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and then decreased over time. Stable knockout of RAPGEF6 in macrophages using lentiviral vectors attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses and oxidative stress by inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated necroptosis. Time-series transcriptomic analysis revealed highly dynamic gene expression trajectories in sepsis patients. RAPGEF6, identified as a key biomarker with temporal characteristics, may regulate inflammation and oxidative stress via NF-kappaB-mediated necroptosis."
41080851,Artificial intelligence-driven prediction and interpretation of central line-associated bloodstream infections in ICU: insights from the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and internally validate interpretable machine learning (ML) models for predicting individual central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) risk in adult ICU patients with central venous catheters (CVCs) using the MIMIC-IV database. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using the MIMIC-IV database. Adult ICU patients with both central venous catheter placement and blood culture evaluation were included. Patients were classified into CLABSI and non-CLABSI cohorts based on central venous catheter tip culture results. A comprehensive set of demographic, physiological, laboratory, therapeutic, and nursing variables was extracted. Feature selection employed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Seven machine learning (ML) models-logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, support vector machine, neural network, and gradient boosting-were developed and compared. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Brier score. The optimal model was interpreted with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to elucidate feature contributions. RESULTS: Among 11,999 ICU patients, 519 (4.3%) developed CLABSI. CLABSI patients were younger (61.0 vs. 66.0 years), had higher rates of multi-lumen catheters (91.3 vs. 63.6%), mechanical ventilation (90.9 vs. 74.0%), and dialysis (34.9 vs. 7.2%; all p < 0.001). The random forest model achieved optimal performance (AUC 0.950, 95% CI 0.931-0.966; sensitivity 0.904, specificity 0.865), outperforming traditional models. SHAP analysis identified ICU length of stay, unique caregivers, and arterial catheterization as top predictors. CLABSI cases exhibited prolonged ICU stays, increased caregiver exposure, and elevated inflammatory markers. Decision curve analysis confirmed clinical utility, with robust performance maintained in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models, particularly the random forest model, accurately predict CLABSI risk in ICU patients. The use of interpretable AI techniques such as SHAP enhances transparency and provides actionable insights for clinical practice. These findings support the development of early warning systems to reduce CLABSI incidence and improve patient outcomes."
41080572,Establishment and validation of the prediction model based on lymphocyte subsets for acute kidney injury in sepsis patients.,2025,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to construct a risk predictive model for acute kidney injury in sepsis based on peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. METHODS: This prospective study included patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU from March to August 2024 (483 for training and 146 for validation), and 125 patients from September to December 2024 as the external test cohort. Clinical data and peripheral blood samples on days 1 and 3 were collected after ICU admission. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry, covering T cell, B cell, NK cell populations. Differences in clinical variables and lymphocyte subsets between AKI and non-AKI groups were analyzed. A predictive model was developed using LASSO and multivariate logistic regression and validated internally (5-fold cross-validation) and externally. Model performance was assessed using ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A nomogram was constructed for clinical applications. RESULTS: Among the 483 patients, the incidence of AKI was 54.66%. Compared to non-AKI patients, the AKI group had significantly higher SOFA and APACHE II scores and lower GCS scores. Laboratory findings showed higher neutrophil and monocyte counts, and elevated serum creatinine in the AKI group. On day 1, several lymphocyte subsets were significantly altered in the AKI group, including increased CD4(+)CD38(+)T%, CD8(+)CD38(+)T%, CD155(+)T%, CD4(+)TeM(+)T%, CD8(+)TIGIT(+)T%, and M-MDSC, and decreased CD4(+)LAG3(+)T%, CD4(+)TN(+)T%, and Th17 cells. On day 3, AKI patients exhibited further distinct changes in NK cells and T cell activation/exhaustion markers. A predictive model incorporating key clinical (APACHE II and creatinine) and lymphocyte subsets (CD15(+)T%_1(st), CD4(+)LAG3(+)T%_1(st), Th17_1(st), CD8(+)PD1(+)T%_3(rd), CD8(+)TIGIT(+)T%_3(rd), E_MDSC_3(rd), CD8(+)CCR7(+)CD45RA(+)T%_3(rd), CD4(+)CTLA4(+)T%_3(rd), CD4(+)TIM3(+)T%_3(rd), PMN_MDSC_3(rd), and M_MDSC_3(rd)) achieved high accuracy, with an AUC of 0.989 in the training set, 0.895 in the validation set, and 0.906 in the test set. Calibration curves and DCA confirmed the model's reliability and clinical utility. CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets are significantly altered in patients who develop SA-AKI and can serve as potential early biomarkers. The developed predictive model based on clinical and immunological parameters demonstrated robust performance in identifying patients at high risk of SA-AKI, offering a practical tool for early warning and clinical decision-making."
41080306,Correlation Between Microbial Toxin Levels and Biochemical Markers of Organ Damage in ICU Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients admitted to ICUs are at high risk of severe infections that may progress to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. Microbial toxins, such as endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria and exotoxins from Gram-positive organisms, play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation and tissue injury. While biochemical markers are routinely used to monitor organ function, their direct relationship with microbial toxin levels in ICU patients is not well established. OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlation between circulating microbial toxin levels and biochemical indicators of organ damage in ICU patients with microbiologically confirmed infections. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted over 18 months in a tertiary care hospital ICU. A total of 120 adult patients (>/=18 years) with confirmed bacterial or fungal infections were enrolled. Plasma endotoxin concentrations were measured using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) chromogenic assay, with each sample analyzed in duplicate to ensure reproducibility. Intra- and inter-assay variability was maintained below 10% as per the manufacturer's specifications, and polymyxin B inhibition was used in selected samples to confirm assay specificity. Gram-positive exotoxins were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also performed in duplicate with appropriate positive and negative controls. Biochemical parameters included serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity troponin I, and total bilirubin. Organ dysfunction severity was evaluated using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. Data normality was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test, with Pearson's correlation applied to normally distributed variables (creatinine, ALT, AST, hs-TnI) and Spearman's correlation to skewed variables (bilirubin, LDH, endotoxin, exotoxin). RESULTS: The study cohort had a mean age of 54.8+/-13.2 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4:1. Gram-negative organisms were identified in 68 patients (56.7%), Gram-positive in 38 (31.7%), and mixed infections in 14 (11.6%). Median endotoxin levels were significantly higher in Gram-negative infections compared to Gram-positive (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.001). Endotoxin concentrations correlated strongly with serum creatinine (r=0.64, 95%CI: 0.48-0.75, p<0.001), total bilirubin (r=0.59, 95%CI: 0.42-0.72, p<0.001), and SOFA scores (r=0.71, 95%CI: 0.57-0.81, p<0.001). Exotoxin levels demonstrated significant correlations with LDH (r=0.55, 95%CI: 0.31-0.72) and high-sensitivity troponin I (r=0.48, 95%CI: 0.22-0.67, p=0.004). Patients with septic shock (n=42) exhibited markedly elevated toxin levels, deranged biochemical parameters, prolonged ICU stays (median: 12 days, IQR: 9-16), and mortality rates exceeding 50%. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for SOFA scores and comorbidities, both endotoxin (OR=2.18) and exotoxin levels (OR=1.74) remained significant independent predictors of mortality and organ dysfunction severity. CONCLUSION: Microbial toxin burden demonstrates a strong association with biochemical evidence of organ injury and disease severity in ICU patients. Combined toxin-biomarker profiling may have prognostic value for identifying high-risk patients, but its clinical application requires validation through larger multicentre studies with serial sampling before widespread adoption."
41080151,Impact of Diabetes on Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis in Sepsis: A Retrospective Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) may alter the clinical trajectory of sepsis by modulating immune responses, infection patterns, and outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of diabetes on the clinical characteristics and prognosis of sepsis patients. METHODS: This retrospective included 256 adult sepsis patients admitted between January 2021 and December 2024. Based on diabetes status, patients were categorized into a diabetic group (n = 151) and a non-diabetic group (n = 105). Clinical features, laboratory parameters, infection types, and outcomes were compared. Prognostic factors in diabetic sepsis were assessed using Spearman correlation and logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared to non-diabetic patients, diabetic sepsis patients had higher rates of Escherichia coli infection (25.5% vs 10.6%, chi(2) = 8.450, p = 0.004), fungal co-infection (23.84% vs 5.71%, p = 0.004), and urinary tract infections (45.03% vs 30.48%). Diabetic patients also had elevated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (13.4 +/- 6.5 vs 10.7 +/- 4.4, t = 3.706, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (median 0.45 vs 0.37 mg/dL, Z = 4.506, p < 0.01), and procalcitonin (PCT) levels (median 7.9 vs 3.7 ng/mL, Z = 3.118, p < 0.05), along with increased mortality (25.83% vs 15.24%, chi(2) = 4.117, p < 0.05). Among diabetic patients, APACHE II score correlated with 28-day mortality (r = 0.463, p < 0.001) and was an independent predictor (OR = 1.177, 95% CI: 1.019-1.361, p = 0.029), whereas CRP and PCT were not independently associated with prognosis (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Diabetic sepsis patients showed distinct microbiological profiles, more urinary and fungal infections, and poorer outcomes. While the APACHE II score was independently associated with 28-day mortality, its moderate correlation suggests a multifactorial interplay. These results support the potential utility of integrated prognostic models combining clinical scores and biomarkers."
41079605,Nucleotide motif-guided selection of plasma microRNA biomarkers in trauma.,2025,"Trauma remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in part due to complex pathophysiological responses. Yet our abilities to predict these changes are limited. Plasma miRNAs have been proposed as DAMPs that drive immune response and organ injury. Here, we test a panel of plasma miRNAs-selected based on next-generation sequencing and nucleotide motifs identified via a machine-learning algorithm-for their abilities to predict subclinical pathophysiological injuries. We find marked and severity-dependent increases in the miRNA biomarkers following trauma, which are closely associated with various injury markers. AUROC indicates that these biomarkers possess strong diagnostic and predictive abilities in overall trauma severity, organ injury, coagulation, endothelial activation, and inflammation. In a combined cohort of trauma and sepsis, miR-224-5p and miR-145-5p emerge as particularly effective in differentiating the two critical illnesses. These observations offer insights into potential values of the plasma miRNAs in the prediction of critical pathophysiological injury in trauma."
41079178,Pyroptosis-Related Molecular Clusters and Immune Infiltration in Pediatric Sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous condition resulting from a dysregulated immune response to infection. Pyroptosis, a newly recognized form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in the progression of various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of pyroptosis-related genes in pediatric sepsis remains unclear. METHODS: Based on the GSE13904 dataset, we explored the pyroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pediatric sepsis. We analyzed the molecular clusters based on pyroptosis-related DEGs. The WGCNA algorithm was performed to identify cluster-specific DEGs. The optimal machine model was identified by multiple machine learning methods (RF, SVM, GLM, XGB). The diagnostic value of hub genes in pediatric sepsis was verified in the training (GSE13904) and validation set (GSE26440) through ROC. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression levels of 5 hub genes in whole blood between the pediatric sepsis and the control. RESULTS: The dysregulated pyroptosis-related DEGs were identified in pediatric sepsis. Three pyroptosis-related molecular clusters were determined in pediatric sepsis. SVM presented the best discriminative performance with relatively lower residual and root mean square error. The nomogram, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis indicated the accuracy of SVM model to predict pediatric sepsis. 5 hub genes based on SVM presented satisfactory performance in the training and validation sets. These hub genes expression levels in pediatric sepsis were significantly higher than those in healthy controls in clinical samples. CONCLUSION: Our study systematically analyzed the relationship between pyroptosis and pediatric sepsis, and constructed a promising predictive model to evaluate the risk of pediatric sepsis."
41078611,Prediction of new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis patients by machine learning: A systematic review.,2025,"AIMS: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) occurs in approximately 23% of patients with sepsis and is independently associated with increased mortality. Therefore, early prediction of NOAF has significant clinical value. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) models predominantly rely on tabular data. These unimodal AI models face limitations in predicting NOAF as they fail to fully utilize the predictive potential arising from the interplay of multimodal data. METHODS: We reviewed current Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches for atrial fibrillation (AF) prediction. It summarizes the selected features in ML models for predicting AF in ICU patients, and the advantages of time-window selection in DL models using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Notably, we compared these models in terms of feature selection, prediction horizons, and performance when applied to tabular data and ECG signal features. To enhance the predictive capability of ML for NOAF in patients with sepsis, we drew inspiration from multimodal models developed for other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and proposed integrating tabular data and ECG signal data within a multimodal framework. RESULTS: This study systematically analyzed the application of ML and DL in AF prediction. After screening, 12 studies (6 ML, 6 DL) were included. ML models, based on electronic medical records (EMR) or ECG features, achieved prediction windows ranging from minutes to hours with AUCs of 0.74-0.90. DL models processing raw ECG signals extended prediction windows to days, achieving AUCs of 0.74-0.96, with performance improving with larger datasets. A Transformer-based multimodal model (integrating clinical data and ECG) was proposed to enhance AF prediction in sepsis patients, though further validation is needed for cross-modal data fusion feasibility. CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning from unimodal predictive models to multimodal frameworks that combine tabular clinical data and raw ECG signals is feasible within the current deep-learning framework. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the early prediction capabilities of NOAF in sepsis patients."
41077232,Triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio as a predictor of 28-day mortality risk in patients with Sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio (TG/HDL) and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis, and to provide a new indicator and basis for the prognosis evaluation of patients with sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted that included 578 patients who met the Sepsis 3.0 criteria. Data collection encompassed demographic information, vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, treatment interventions, and prognostic outcomes. The TG/HDL measurement was taken within 24 h of ICU admission. Patients were categorized into a survival group and a 28-day non-survival group. Additionally, they were stratified into quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) based on their TG/HDL levels. A range of statistical methods were employed for data processing and analysis, including t-tests, non-parametric tests, chi2 tests, logistic regression analysis, subgroup analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and nonlinear regression analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the 28-day mortality and survival groups in age, heart rate, and respiratory rate. TG/HDL quartile analysis showed group differences in multiple parameters and 28-day mortality. Logistic regression indicated that, relative to Q1, Q4 had a significantly elevated 28-day mortality risk (Model 1: OR = 3.434, P < 0.001; Model 2: OR = 4.655, P < 0.001; Model 3: OR = 2.690, P = 0.004), while Q2 and Q3 did not. Subgroup analysis revealed that the TG/HDL-mortality association varied by subgroup. The KM survival curve showed lower Q4 survival, and nonlinear regression confirmed a nonlinear TG/HDL-mortality relationship. CONCLUSION: TG/HDL ratio can serve as an independent predict of 28-day mortality. Its nonlinearity and subgroup-specific significance offer crucial insights for clinical prognostic stratification."
41076474,Deleterious variants in LTBP4 are associated with severe pediatric sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading global health burden in children, and its unavoidable heterogeneity has hindered providing therapies beyond antibiotics and supportive care. Recently, we identified four computable phenotypes showing distinct cytokine profiles, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic response characteristics (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) in a multicenter pediatric sepsis cohort. METHODS: In the cohort data, we collected whole-exome sequencing data and identified rare variants associated with PedSep-D phenotype by conducting a gene-based analysis in an aggregated fashion. RESULTS: As a result, one whole-exome significant gene (LTBP4) and two suggestive significant genes (PLA2G4E, CCDC157) showed association with PedSep-D, the phenotype characterized by the most severe outcomes and highest inflammation. The associated variants in LTBP4 were enriched for predicted deleterious effects based on established functional prediction metrics. All three associated genes are implicated in inflammation and immune cell activation based on existing gene function and expression data. Although the circulating cytokine profiles were overlapping between the rare variant carriers, we also identified gene-specific cytokine changes. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our study provides valuable insights into the genetic architecture of a pediatric sepsis phenotype with the highest inflammation level and the most severe outcomes, highlighting potential candidate genes and pathways for further biomarker and therapeutic studies. IMPACT: Pediatric sepsis exhibits substantial heterogeneity, with genetic variation contributing to this variability. Rare variants in LTBP4 are significantly associated with the most severe pediatric sepsis phenotype (PedSep-D), while variants in PLA2G4E and CCDC157 show associations with this phenotype in suggestive significance. Expands on the concept of sepsis phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, D) by incorporating genetic insights, moving beyond clinical and cytokine profiles to uncover molecular drivers. Opens new avenues for mechanistic studies to understand the genetic underpinnings of severe inflammation and immune activation in sepsis."
41075755,Ahnak and Nckap1l as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Landiolol-mediated sepsis treatment.,2026,"PURPOSE: Landiolol is a beta-blocker used in the treatment of Sepsis. However, how this drug influences key genes and pathways involved in disease remains unknown. This study aimed to explore potential biomarkers involved in the mechanism of Landiolol's action in sepsis. METHODS: Two microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Then, Landiolol-associated genes (lnd-DEGs) were screened using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), followed by enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network investigation. Biomarkers were explored using three machine learning methods (LASSO, SVM-RFE, and RF), followed by diagnostic and prognostic analyses of these biomarkers. RESULTS: After landiolol treatment, a total of 45 DEGs were identified when compared to normal samples. These genes were primarily associated with 357 biological functions, including the inositol phosphate metabolic process, and six key pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol signaling system. Using three different machine learning methods, 4 signature genes related to landiolol's action on sepsis were identified. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated high predictive accuracy for Ahnak and Nckap1l in sepsis. Clinical correlation analysis revealed that Nckap1l and Ahnak were significantly associated with endotype and overall survival (OS) of sepsis, respectively. Finally, the prognostic value of Ahnak was validated through Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ahnak and Nckap1l are potential diagnostic biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention in landiolol-induced sepsis following administration of Landiolol. Nckap1l can be used for endotype analysis of sepsis."
41072561,Circulating Bacteriophage DNA Distinguishes Staphylococcal Infection From Commensal Colonization.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacteriophage sequences from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma can be used to diagnose bacterial pathogens during sepsis. Here, we hypothesize that plasma bacteriophage cfDNA can serve as a serological biomarker to monitor Staphylococcal periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). METHODS: Using a previously described computational pipeline, bacteriophage sequences were identified in cfDNA from plasma of three distinct patient cohorts: patients with a current Staphylococcal PJI, prior PJI, and no PJI. The overall phageome was described in all three cohorts, and the proportion of Staphylococcus bacteriophage was compared among the three cohorts. The presence of Staphylococcus bacteriophage as a binary variable was also analyzed for its diagnostic performance in identifying Staphylococcal PJI. RESULTS: There were no differences in the distribution of bacterial cfDNA among the three cohorts (P = 0.597). The current PJI cohort had a significantly higher proportion of Staphylococcus bacteriophage compared to no PJI (median, 2.6 versus 0%, P = 0.013), and the prior PJI cohort had a significantly higher proportion of Staphylococcus bacteriophage compared to no PJI (median, 1.0 versus 0%, P = 0.049). Of note, there was no difference in proportion of Staphylococcus bacteriophage between current PJI and prior PJI (median, 2.6% versus 1.0%, P = 0.554). Staphylococcus bacteriophage was present in six of ten samples in current PJI, seven of 12 samples in prior PJI, and one of 13 samples in the no PJI groups. The presence of Staphylococcus bacteriophage had a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 92% for a Staphylococcal PJI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that plasma bacteriophage cfDNA offers a promising approach to detect and monitor Staphylococcal PJI. The persistence of these Staphylococcus bacteriophages in prior PJI may reflect subclinical infection or residual microbial DNA undetectable by standard culture-based diagnostics."
41072548,Refining a Machine Learning Model for Predicting Infant Sepsis: A Multidisciplinary Team Supported by Human-Centered Design Methods.,2025,"Human-centered design (HCD) methods in machine learning generally focus on workflow, user interfaces, and data visualizations, but there is the potential to apply these methods to inform the model development and testing process.This study aimed to demonstrate the potential of HCD methods to support the design and testing of machine learning models developed for clinical decision-making.In preparing for formative user testing of clinician facing representations of a machine learning model for detecting sepsis in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients, we discovered that interactive low fidelity mockups using real patient data revealed potential model anomalies. To further investigate these potential anomalies, we utilized the qualitative analysis of interviews with 31 NICU clinicians concerning their experience with neonatal sepsis. The review process was conducted by a multidisciplinary team with members having expertise in neonatology, informatics, data science, and human computer interaction (HCI). Anomalies identified via the mockups and interview analysis were further analyzed by inspections of patient charts and model features and code.The HCD-facilitated review revealed anomalies in three categories: (1) feature inclusion and exclusion, (2) feature importance, and (3) model stability over time. Data entry errors in the electronic health record and their impact on model output were also noted. The review resulted in 41 changes to the model.The discovery of over 41 opportunities to improve our prediction model was a serendipitous by-product of the HCD process. Our results suggest that HCD can be applied not only to model display design and measures of explainability, but to the development and evaluation of the model itself. This case report also demonstrates the need for a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, data scientists, and HCI experts in identifying and addressing issues involving machine learning model performance."
41071816,"Predictive value of urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] for AKI among sepsis, stroke, and cardiac surgery cohorts: A prospective study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 have shown effectiveness as biomarkers for predicting Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). However, the variations in the predictive capacity of urinary [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] for AKI across different etiologies remain unexplored. This study aimed to assess the predictive capability of urinary [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] for AKI in three distinct disease cohorts (stroke, sepsis, and cardiac surgery) characterized by differing AKI etiologies. METHODS: This prospective observational study evaluated the predictive value of urinary [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] among three cohorts with varying AKI causes. Binary logistic regression was employed to identify AKI's independent risk factors and develop a combined prediction model. The predictive value was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) analyses. RESULTS: 337 patients were included in the final analysis, with 109 (32.3%) developing AKI. AKI occurred in 39 (22.2%) stroke patients, 52 (50%) sepsis patients, and 18 (31.6%) post-cardiac surgery patients. [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] exhibited predictive value for AKI with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.90) in stroke, 0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.91) in sepsis, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.98) in post-cardiac surgery. DeLong's test indicated no significant differences in the predictive value of [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] between the cardiac surgery group and the stroke (P=0.20) and sepsis (P=0.21) groups. CONCLUSION: The combined prediction model, which integrates urinary [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] concentrations and AKI risk factors, significantly enhances AKI prediction. No significant differences were found in the predictive value of urinary [TIMP-2]* [IGFBP7] for AKI among the stroke, sepsis, and cardiac surgery cohorts."
41071041,Automating candidate gene prioritization with large language models: from naive scoring to literature-grounded validation.,2025,"MOTIVATION: Identifying promising therapeutic targets from thousands of genes in transcriptomic studies remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research. While large language models (LLMs) show potential for gene prioritization, they suffer from hallucination and lack systematic validation against expert knowledge. RESULTS: The framework identified 609 sepsis-relevant genes with >94% filtering efficiency, demonstrating strong enrichment for inflammatory pathways including TNF-alpha signaling, complement activation, and interferon responses. Literature validation yielded 30 ultra-high confidence therapeutic candidates, including both established sepsis genes (IL10, TREM1, S100A9, NLRP3) and novel targets warranting investigation. Benchmark validation against expert-curated databases achieved 71.2% recall, with systematic correlation between computational confidence and evidence quality. The final candidate set balanced discovery (11 novel genes) with validation (19 known genes), maintaining biological coherence throughout the filtering process. This framework demonstrates that rigorous methodology can transform unreliable LLM outputs into systematically validated biological insights. By combining computational efficiency with literature grounding, the approach provides a practical tool for prioritizing experimental validation efforts. The modular design enables adaptation to other diseases through knowledge base substitution, offering a systematic approach to literature-guided biomarker discovery. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We developed a two-stage computational framework that combines LLM-based screening with literature validation for systematic gene prioritization. Starting with 10 824 genes from the BloodGen3 repertoire, we applied multi-criteria evaluation for sepsis relevance, followed by retrieval-augmented generation using 6346 curated sepsis publications. A novel faithfulness evaluation system verified that LLM predictions aligned with retrieved literature evidence.

41070114,"Identification of Biomarkers for Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury Through Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Approaches, with Experimental Validation.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains a life-threatening condition due to the lack of reliable early diagnostic biomarkers. Machine learning offers powerful tools for analyzing high-dimensional gene expression data and identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: Five datasets (GSE10474, GSE32707, GSE66890, GSE10361, GSE3037) were obtained from the GEO database. After assessment and normalization, GSE10474, GSE32707, and GSE66890 were combined as a training set to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were intersected with genes from key modules identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), yielding 213 overlapping genes. These were analyzed via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. Eight machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, GLM, GBM, KNN, NNET, LASSO, DT) were used to develop diagnostic models, which were validated on GSE10361 and GSE3037. Model performance was evaluated using a nomogram, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Immune and inflammatory states were assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Potential therapeutic compounds were identified through the DSigDB database via the Enrichr platform. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations examined interactions between Resveratrol and selected targets. In vitro experiments validated these findings. RESULTS: A total of 213 candidate genes were identified by intersecting DEGs with WGCNA-derived MEblue module genes. GO and KEGG analyses indicated associations with immune activation and bacterial infection. Four key genes (DDAH2, PNPLA2, STXBP2, TCN1) were selected using eight machine learning algorithms. The diagnostic model showed good performance via nomogram, calibration curve, and DCA. Molecular docking revealed stable binding of Resveratrol to these genes. In vitro, Resveratrol pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced ALI by modulating the core genes. CONCLUSION: The four genes may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for sepsis-ALI. Resveratrol represents a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting these genes."
41069598,Radix Pseudostellaria polysaccharides alleviate sepsis-induced liver injury by modulating the gut microbiota via the TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced liver injury (SLI) is a life-threatening complication with limited therapeutic options. Radix Pseudostellariae polysaccharides (RPPS), a component of traditional Chinese medicine, exert immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of RPPS on SLI. METHODS: A murine sepsis model was established using cecal ligation and puncture. Mice were pretreated with RPPS or saline for 14 days. Subsequently, multi-omics integration-including metagenomics, proteomics, and network pharmacology-was employed to elucidate the mechanisms of RPPS. Liver injury was assessed via serum biomarkers, histopathology, and transmission electron microscopy, while intestinal barrier integrity was evaluated through histopathological analysis. Gut microbiota composition and functional pathways were examined using metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses of gut microbiota, liver proteomics, and network pharmacology data were integrated to predict key target pathways, which were experimentally validated in mice. RESULTS: RPPS pretreatment significantly improved survival, reduced liver injury markers, attenuated hepatic necrosis and inflammation, and restored intestinal barrier integrity. RPPS also modulated the gut microbiota by enriching beneficial taxa and suppressing pathogens. Multi-omics integration identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathway as the core mechanism, and experimental validation confirmed that RPPS inhibited TLR4 membrane expression, MyD88/IKKalpha/beta activation, NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. In conclusion, RPPS alleviates SLI by protecting the intestinal barrier, modulating gut microbiota, and suppressing the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides a scientific foundation for RPPS as a potential therapeutic candidate in sepsis treatment."
41068825,Regulatory effect of miR-142-5p on inflammatory process of sepsis by targeting CXCL8.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response triggered by infection. The rapid progression of the disease necessitates early diagnosis and precise intervention, making the identification of reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets crucial for improving clinical outcomes and reducing sepsis-related mortality. AIM: Exploring miR-142-5p as a novel diagnostic biomarker for sepsis and its therapeutic potential via targeting CXCL8. METHODS: The expression levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) and miR-142-5p in the serum of patients with sepsis and healthy controls were detected by ELISA and qPCR methods respectively. The diagnostic potential of miR-142-5p was evaluated using Pearson correlation, ROC curve, and logistic regression analyses. Bioinformatic prediction and dual-luciferase assays identified CXCL8 as a target, while LPS-induced models and cell transfection experiments investigated miR-142-5p's therapeutic effects through CXCL8 regulation. RESULTS: Sepsis patients exhibited significantly decreased miR-142-5p expression, inversely correlating with inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta). ROC analysis showed excellent diagnostic value (AUC = 0.917). Pearson correlations indicated significant clinical associations, while logistic regression identified miR-142-5p as an independent protective factor (HR = 0.498, 95% CI:0.282-0.882, P = 0.017). LPS models confirmed miR-142-5p's anti-inflammatory effects through cytokine suppression, with knockdown showing opposite effects. Mechanistically, dual-luciferase and transfection assays verified CXCL8 as a direct target mediating these effects. CONCLUSION: miR-142-5p may alleviate sepsis by targeting CXCL8-mediated inflammation, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target."
41067873,"Large-scale proteomic profiling identifies distinct inflammatory phenotypes in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicentre, prospective cohort study.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Host responses during acute respiratory distress syndrome are highly heterogeneous, contributing to inconsistent therapeutic outcomes. Proteome-based phenotyping may identify biologically and clinically distinct phenotypes to guide precision therapy. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we used latent class analysis of targeted serum proteomics to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome phenotypes. Serum samples were collected within 72 h of diagnosis to capture early-phase profiles. Validation was conducted in external cohorts. Pathway enrichment assessed molecular heterogeneity. Lung computed tomography scans were analysed using machine learning-based radiomics to explore phenotypic distinctions. Heterogeneous treatment effects for glucocorticoids and ventilation strategies were evaluated using inverse probability of treatment weighting adjusted Cox regression. A multinomial XGBoost model was developed to classify phenotypes. RESULTS: Among 1048 patients, three inflammatory phenotypes (C1, C2, C3) were identified and validated in two independent cohorts. The phenotype C1, with a larger proportion of poorly/non-inflated lung compartments, had the highest 90-day mortality and shock incidence and fewest ventilator-free days, followed by C3, while C2 patients had the best outcomes (p<0.001). Phenotype C1 was characterised by intense innate immune activation, cytokine amplification and metabolic reprogramming. Phenotype C2 demonstrated immune suppression, enhanced tissue repair and restoration of anti-inflammatory metabolism. Phenotype C3, comprising the oldest patients, reflected an intermediate state with moderate immune activation and partial immune resolution. Glucocorticoid therapy and higher positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation improved 90-day outcomes in C1 but increased mortality in C2 patients (p(interaction)<0.05). Finally, a 12-biomarker classifier can accurately distinguish phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated three proteome-based acute respiratory distress syndrome phenotypes with distinct clinical, radiographic and molecular profiles. Their differential treatment responses highlight the potential of biomarker-driven strategies for acute respiratory distress syndrome precision medicine."
41067487,Sepsis diagnosis and monitoring: Frontiers in innovative technology.,2026,"One of the most common hospital-associated infections, especially in the ICU, is sepsis, and its early detection is a significant issue that health care systems must contend with. Effective treatment of sepsis requires early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic intervention. The early detection of this life-threatening condition is significantly improved not only by identifying drug-resistant pathogens but also by detecting unique immune response biomarkers that arise upon pathogen invasion, thus creating a critical early warning system. The methodology involves advanced molecular diagnostic tools, such as real-time PCR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and novel biomarker detection platforms. These methods enable faster identification of pathogens and biomarkers, enhancing the accuracy and speed of sepsis diagnosis. We also discuss the integration of these technologies with clinical workflows, considering their impact on patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. In this paper, we review novel and rapid sepsis diagnostic techniques compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the significance and efficiency of the emerging technologies. An extensive review of the literature was conducted through databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar with keywords such as ""sepsis"" and ""diagnostic strategies"" to identify the most suitable articles for this review. Effective management of sepsis, a complex and deadly disease, relies on knowledge and application of rapid diagnostic techniques, such as new analytic tools, for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Advanced molecular diagnosis and clinical trials are maximizing therapeutic control with biomarker tracking (sTREM-1, IL-6, PCT) and improving diagnostic accuracy. Introducing new technologies in molecular diagnosis, analysis, and clinical management is crucial to improve septic shock patient outcomes. Our review highlights that while traditional methods such as blood culture remain essential, they are limited by long turnaround times and reduced sensitivity. Rapid molecular assays (PCR, MALDI-TOF) and biosensor-based point-of-care platforms provide results within hours, enabling earlier targeted treatment. Among biomarkers, procalcitonin remains the most established, but newer candidates such as presepsin, CXCL5, and circRNAs show promising diagnostic and prognostic potential. Integrating these innovative technologies into clinical workflows can enhance early detection, support antimicrobial stewardship, and ultimately improve patient survival."
41066922,Deferoxamine attenuates sepsis-induced liver injury by suppressing ferroptosis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The liver is among the organs most frequently damaged during sepsis, and sepsis-induced liver injury is an independent risk factor for early patient mortality. Ferroptosis has been implicated in sepsis-related organ dysfunction; however, its role in sepsis-induced liver injury remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis in sepsis-associated liver injury. METHODS: A rat sepsis model was established in vivo using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In vitro, BRL-3A hepatocytes were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Deferoxamine (DFO) was administered prior to model induction. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations and the extent of liver injury were assessed. Ferroptosis-related biomarkers, including ferrous ions (Fe(2+)), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4(ACSL4), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were quantified. Lipid peroxidation was measured using the BODIPY 581/591 C11 fluorescent probe. Mitochondrial function was evaluated using electron microscopy and JC-1 fluorescent probe assays. RESULTS: (1) In vivo, DFO treatment was found to alleviate systemic inflammation in septic rats and provided protective effects on the liver. It increased the 7-day survival rate, reduced serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and mitigated histopathological damage in liver tissue. In vitro, DFO treatment enhanced the viability of LPS-stimulated BRL-3A hepatocytes. (2) Ferroptosis was observed to be activated in septic rats as well as in LPS-stimulated BRL-3A hepatocytes. DFO reduced the intracellular concentration of ferrous ions and reduced lipid peroxidation as indicated by decreased PTGS2, ACSL4 and MDA. Furthermore, DFO alleviated mitochondrial damage (manifested as reduced mitochondrial volume, decreased membrane density, reduced cristae and outer membrane rupture, etc.), and mitochondrial function was improved. Finally, DFO elevated the levels of GSH and GPX4, which enhanced the antioxidant capacity of hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Ferroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced liver injury. Targeting the activation of ferroptosis in hepatocytes during sepsis through intervention with DFO may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of this condition."
41065504,Biomarkers of Microcirculatory Dysfunction in Sepsis: A Pilot Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"CONTEXT: To evaluate and compare sublingual microscopy (SLM) to urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays, dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) quantification of GAGs as biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction in patients with sepsis and septic shock. HYPOTHESIS: Indicators of microvascular dysfunction and markers of endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation would be associated with sepsis. METHODS AND MODELS: Prospective, observational case-control study. SETTING: Denver Health Medical Center, a safety-net hospital in Denver, CO. SUBJECTS: Forty-four adult patients with sepsis or septic shock and 24 healthy control patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and incarceration. RESULTS: Sublingual microvascular parameters (De Backer Density, proportion of perfused vessels) were measured using darkfield sidestream microscopy, and urinary GAGs were measured via DMMB colorimetric assay and LC-MS/MS targeting heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Validation of HS quantification was performed on a subset using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). LC-MS/MS HS was significantly higher in sepsis vs. controls (Area under the curve 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95), demonstrating higher diagnostic performance than SLM (De Backer Density AUC 0.71) and DMMB GAGs (AUC 0.62). LC-MS/MS and HILIC-MS HS levels were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.97, p < 0.001). DMMB GAGs were associated with HS subtypes (p = 0.05) and SLM density (p = 0.03). No significant associations with in-hospital mortality or acute kidney injury were observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated modalities, LC-MS/MS quantification of HS showed the greatest discriminative ability for identifying sepsis and correlated strongly with established mass spectrometric methods. SLM exhibited moderate diagnostic utility and significant associations with GAG levels, reinforcing its biologic relevance. However, its bedside application may be limited by challenges in image acquisition and analysis. The concordance across SLM, DMMB, and LC-MS/MS supports eGC degradation as a key feature of sepsis pathophysiology. These findings highlight the promise of LC-MS/MS as a scalable, rapid, and mechanistically informed platform for biomarker-driven enrichment in future sepsis trials and clinical care."
41064640,Trajectory of the systemic immune-inflammation index and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a complex systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection with high morbidity and mortality. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a biomarker of inflammation and immune status. This study investigated the relationship between the SII trajectory and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. METHODS: This retrospective study included 1015 adults who were admitted via the emergency department of the First Hospital of Jilin University with a first episode of sepsis between June 2018 and February 2025. Latent-class mixed models (LCMM) were used to identify SII trajectory subgroups, and Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship between subgroups and in-hospital mortality. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model was used to quantify the effect of each variable on the risk of in-hospital mortality. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis assessed the nonlinear relationship between SII and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: LCMM analysis identified five SII trajectory subgroups. Cox regression analysis showed that Class 1 (the group with continuous increase in SII from a low to medium level), Class 3 (the group with a stable decline in SII from a high level), Class 4 (the group with a stable high SII level) and Class 5 (the group with a stable medium SII level) all had higher risk of in-hospital mortality than Class 2 (the group with a stable medium-high SII level). Class 1 and Class 4 had the highest risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 15.14 and 6.31, respectively). The XGBoost model confirmed that the SII trajectories were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between the SII within 24 hours after admission and in-hospital mortality, with both low and high SII levels associated with higher in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, the risk of in-hospital mortality differs according to the SII within 24 hours of admission and the SII trajectory. The risk of in-hospital mortality was greatest in patients whose SII increased continuously and those whose SII stabilized at a high level, and was lowest in patients with an SII stabilized at a medium-high level. The SII within 24 hours after admission had a U-shaped relationship with in-hospital mortality."
41063987,The amphiregulin- epidermal growth factor receptor axis as a therapeutic target in sepsis.,2025,"The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and its ligand, amphiregulin (AREG) are critical for epithelial cell proliferation but their important role in inflammation and infection is increasingly described. We recently discovered that the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin, could identify a cohort of infants with sepsis, even when CRP was low, identifying it as a potentially adjunctive biomarker for early infection. Its role in adult sepsis however, has yet to be delineated. We conducted a prospective observational study of 42 critically ill septic adult patients on the Intensive Care Unit, comparing serum amphiregulin levels and the frequencies of EGFR-expressing myeloid and lymphoid cells (using spectral flow cytometry) in sepsis survivors and non-survivors, and 20 healthy volunteers. We demonstrate, for the first time, the strong association between serum amphiregulin and in-hospital mortality (AUROC = 0.87). Moreover, we demonstrate that a higher frequency of circulating CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes express either the ligand (AREG) or receptor (EGFR) ex vivo, in sepsis, and expression of CD4(+) lymphocyte EGFR was associated with several features of immunosuppression. Together, our data suggest that EGFR-signaling represents a novel candidate of T cell dysregulation in sepsis and warrants further investigation."
41063835,Association of lactate to albumin ratio with short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure complicated by sepsis: a retrospective study using the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Elevated lactate to albumin ratio (LAR) has been associated with poor prognosis in critical illnesses. However, evidence regarding LAR in patients with heart failure (HF) complicated by sepsis remains limited. This study aimed to explore the relationship between LAR and both short-term and long-term mortality in this population. METHOD: Patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and stratified into quartiles based on LAR. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare outcomes across the four groups. Association between LAR and mortality was assessed using restricted cubic splines (RCS) and Cox regression analysis. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULT: Among 4,242 participants (mean age 72.04 +/- 13.50 years; 57.33% male), Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher LAR levels were associated with increased 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed that elevated LAR was independently associated with higher 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality (HR: 1.101, 95% CI 1.005-1.205; HR: 1.125, 95% CI 1.039-1.218). The highest LAR quartile (>0.97) remained significantly associated with both 28-day and 365-day mortality (Q4 vs. Q1: HR: 1.313, 95% CI 1.063-1.622; HR: 1.310, 95% CI 1.092-1.571). RCS analysis indicated a linear positive correlation between LAR and mortality (P for nonlinear > 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction with hypertension (P for interaction = 0.033 for 28-day; P for interaction = 0.015 for 365-day). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with HF complicated by sepsis, LAR is a reliable and independent predictor of mortality. Patients in the highest LAR quartile (>0.97) have a significantly increased risk of death, providing a clinically useful reference for rapid identification of high-risk individuals. The significant interaction observed in hypertensive subgroups highlights the need for heightened clinical attention. Overall, LAR may serve as a practical biomarker for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation in this vulnerable population."
41063610,Role of Neutrophil CD64 in Early Detection of Neonatal Sepsis and its Correlation with Other Sepsis Biomarkers.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis may be helpful in decreasing neonatal mortality. Neutrophil CD64 (nCD64) is a leukocyte surface antigen whose expression increases about an hour after bacterial invasion. We aimed to study the expression and diagnostic utility of nCD64 in the early detection of neonatal sepsis compared to existing sepsis indicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted on 140 neonates in a tertiary healthcare center. Those having clinical sepsis were taken as cases and healthy neonates were enrolled as controls. In cases, blood samples were collected for blood culture, sepsis screen and nCD64 expression. Neonates were divided into three groups: Group 1 (n = 3) with both blood culture and sepsis screen positive, Group 2 (n = 40) with blood culture negative but sepsis screen positive and Group 3 (n = 27) with both blood culture and sepsis screen negative. Group 4 (n = 70) was the control. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data was entered in an MS EXCEL spreadsheet and was analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Paired T test/Wilcoxon test was used for comparing nCD64. Quantitative and qualitative variables were also compared. The McNemar test was used to compare sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: nCD64 expression was highest in Group 1 (23.2%), followed by Groups 2 and 3. It showed high sensitivity (78.57%) and specificity (100%) in sepsis cases. Significant positive correlation was also noted between nCD64 and other sepsis biomarkers. CONCLUSION: CD64 expression may, thus, be considered as a rapid and reliable marker for early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis."
41063307,Prognostic role of creatine kinase-MB in elderly patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Although creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is a well-established predictor of myocardial infarction, emerging evidence suggests it has prognostic value in various infections; however, its role in sepsis remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of CK-MB for short-term mortality in elderly patients with sepsis. METHODS: A total of 1752 patients aged >/= 60 with sepsis were included and divided into four groups according to the quartiles of CK-MB within 24 h after ICU admission: < 6.6 (n = 435), 6.6-10.9 (n = 440), 10.9-18.5 (n = 435) and >/= 18.5 (n = 442). Multivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the association of CK-MB with 28-day mortality and identify the risk factors for CK-MB elevation. RESULTS: Both in-hospital (39.1% vs 43.0% vs 51.3% vs 60.4%, P < 0.001) and 28-day mortality (24.7% vs 30.2% vs 40.8% vs 56.3%, P < 0.001) rose progressively with increasing CK-MB levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed log(10) CK-MB (HR=2.32, P < 0.001) and elevated CK-MB (>25U/L; HR=1.92, P<0.001) as independent predictors of 28-day mortality. The Receiver Operation Characteristic curve analysis demonstrated comparable predictive performance between CK-MB and lactic acid for 28-day mortality (Area under the curve: 0.650 vs. 0.649, P = 0.962). Adding CK-MB to APACHE II improved mortality prediction of sepsis (Categorical Net Reclassification Index = 2.5%, P = 0.038). Patients with both CK-MB > 25 U/L and lactate > 2 mmol/L had the highest mortality. Liver disease, renal impairment, vasopressor use, and hyperlactatemia were independent risk factors for elevated CK-MB. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with sepsis, elevated CK-MB level measured upon ICU admission was associated with increased 28-day mortality. The combination of CK-MB and lactic acid levels may enhance risk stratification in sepsis patients."
41063291,Prognostic value of low-cost white blood cell indices and procalcitonin for mortality in Rwandan sepsis patients: a prospective intensive care unit study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, early identification of sepsis and low-cost mortality predictors is critical for intensive care unit (ICU) triage. This study evaluated the prognostic value of baseline sociodemographic factors, routine hematological indices, and serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels for 40-day mortality among adult ICU patients meeting Sepsis-2 criteria in Rwanda. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 125 ICU patients was followed for 40 days. Baseline variables included sex, age, PCT, total white blood cell (WBC) count, differential counts (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Survival probabilities were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models identified independent mortality predictors, with assumptions tested via Schoenfeld residuals and multicollinearity assessed using variance inflation factors. Time-dependent receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis evaluated model performance at days 6, 10, and 15 using the area under the curve (AUC) values. RESULTS: Of 125 patients, 56 (44.8%) were female. Median age was 41 years for survivors and 50 years for non-survivors (p = 0.097). In multivariable Cox regression, elevated neutrophil counts were independently associated with increased mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)] 1.99; 95% CI (confidence intervals) 1.37-2.88; p < 0.001), corresponding to a twofold higher hazard of death for approximately a threefold increase in neutrophil count. No significant associations were found for sex, age, or PCT. ROC analysis showed that models integrating neutrophils and total WBC (TotalWBC) achieved the highest predictive accuracy, with AUCs ranging from ~68% to 71% across all time points, outperforming simpler models. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated neutrophil counts at ICU admission are independently associated with increased mortality. Integrating absolute neutrophil and WBC data into predictive models enhances early mortality risk stratification. These findings underscore the value of routine biomarkers and robust modeling to guide timely interventions in resource-constrained ICU settings."
41063278,ApoA1/HDL and sepsis-associated vascular endothelial injury: a narrative review.,2025,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of global mortality, primarily driven by microvascular collapse stemming from severe vascular endothelial injury. Within this pathology, the dramatic depletion of Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and its carrier, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is a hallmark feature. Despite being recognized as a prognostic biomarker, a comprehensive understanding of the ApoA1/HDL axis as an active participant and therapeutic target in endothelial protection remains fragmented. This review systematically synthesizes current evidence to reframe the ApoA1/HDL axis from a passive indicator to a master regulator of endothelial homeostasis in sepsis. We first delineate the strong correlation between reduced ApoA1/HDL levels and endothelial damage across various infections. Subsequently, we dissect its protective triad of mechanisms: potent anti-inflammatory actions, preservation of endothelial barrier integrity, and restoration of microvascular flow. Furthermore, we explore the emerging interplay between ApoA1 and exosomes, a novel aspect of its regulatory function. Finally, the translational potential of ApoA1-based therapies, including mimetic peptides and recombinant HDL, is evaluated. By providing an integrated mechanistic framework, this review highlights the ApoA1 as a critical therapeutic target and offers a roadmap for developing novel, endothelium-centric treatments for sepsis."
41063171,Discovery of a resistant cohort to acute kidney injury: insights from patients with septic shock.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant complication among critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis, yet no specific therapies exist. Progress in some diseases has been achieved by analyzing individuals who appear resistant. This study sought to develop a framework to investigate AKI resistance using clinical phenotyping and biomarkers and applied this framework to a large cohort of patients with septic shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial. We measured urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) 6 h after the start of resuscitation. AKI was defined first as high risk by [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] > 1.0 (ng/mL)(2)/1000 and either meeting Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Criteria (KDIGO) criteria within 7 days after the start of resuscitation or having [KIM-1] > 2.0 ng/ml. AKI resistance was defined as the combination of (a) high-risk by [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] > 1.0 (ng/mL)(2)/1000 but without meeting (b) KDIGO AKI criteria nor (c) [KIM-1] > 2.0 ng/ml. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes across three groups: AKI-resistant, AKI, and reduced risk, which was defined as [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] < 1.0 (ng/mL)(2)/1000. RESULTS: Among 573 patients, 339 (59.2%) had reduced risk, 194 (33.9%) developed AKI, and 40 (7%) were AKI-resistant. Median (IQR) non-renal SOFA scores were lower for patients at reduced risk for AKI (5 [2-7]) than for those with AKI resistance (6 [4.5-8], P < 0.01) or AKI (6 [5-9], P < 0.01). Baseline characteristics did not differ between AKI-resistant and AKI-affected individuals. However, AKI-resistant patients experienced significantly lower 30-day mortality (10% vs. 32%; adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09-0.80, P = 0.02) and shorter ICU stays when compared to those with AKI. CONCLUSION: Despite greater illness severity, AKI-resistant patients had similar mortality and length of stay as lower-risk patients but better outcomes than those with AKI. Studying these patients may reveal novel therapeutic targets for AKI prevention and treatment."
41062345,Herpes simplex virus - state of the art of prevention and treatment.,2025,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection remains a life-threatening condition with high morbidity and mortality despite advances in diagnostics and therapy. Transmission occurs predominantly during delivery and the three main clinical phenotypes; skin-eye-mouth disease, central nervous system disease, and disseminated disease, carry distinct prognoses. This state-of-the-art review focuses on prevention and consideration of empirical treatment. Maternal antiviral prophylaxis in late pregnancy has shown to reduce the frequency of active HSV outbreaks at delivery. Decisions on empirical acyclovir therapy must balance early recognition against overtreatment, guided by the number needed to treat, which in European settings among term and near-term infants ranges from over 1,000 for early-onset sepsis to  approximately 150 for late-onset sepsis. Ongoing research focuses on preventive strategies, including vaccine development and novel biomarkers on dried blood spot samples to improve outcomes."
41060994,Longitudinal modeling of red blood cell distribution width dynamics and mortality risk in critically Ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a critical condition with high mortality. Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a potential dynamic biomarker, but longitudinal RDW changes in SA-AKI remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed adult SA-AKI patients from the MIMIC-IV database (2008-2022). Group-Based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) identified distinct longitudinal RDW patterns. Primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) requirement, and ICU length of stay. Multivariable Cox models assessed associations. adjustment for any transfusion and any major hemorrhage, and an exclusion analysis in which all transfused patients were removed. RESULTS: Among 6,694 patients (mean age 65.5 years, 57.7% male), 28-day mortality was 22.5%. Four RDW trajectory groups were identified: Stable Low (27.8%), Gradual Increase (38.5%), Continuous Increase (27.6%), and Rapid Increase (6.1%). The Rapid Increase group demonstrated highest disease severity scores and poorest laboratory profiles. Compared to the Stable Low group, the Rapid Increase group had significantly elevated 28-day mortality risk after full adjustment (HR 4.27, P < 0.001), with consistent patterns for 90-day mortality and resource use. Associations remained consistent across subgroup analyses, multiple-imputation datasets, and the relaxed-inclusion cohort, and were minimally altered after adjusting for transfusion/hemorrhage or excluding transfused patients. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic RDW trajectories were independently associated with adverse outcomes in SA-AKI patients. Across extensive sensitivity analyses, these trajectories functioned as dynamic prognostic indicators without implying causality, supporting their use for risk stratification and individualized patient care."
41060735,Decreased albumin to INR ratio is a prognostic marker of 30-day mortality in neonatal sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. This study aims to assess the clinical significance of the serum albumin (ALB) to international normalized ratio (INR) ratio (AIR) as a predictor for 30-day mortality in neonates with sepsis. METHODOLOGY: Neonates diagnosed with sepsis between January 2019 and December 2022 were included. Admission data were collected, enabling the categorization of neonates into survival and non-survival groups. Logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, were employed. RESULTS: A total of 195 neonates with sepsis were analyzed. The non-survival group exhibited significantly lower AIR compared to the survival group. Multivariate analysis identified low AIR as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.091, p < 0.001), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.746 for AIR. The sensitivity and specificity of AIR were 79.31% and 66.87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AIR serves as a cost-effective and easily obtainable marker in neonatal sepsis research. It emerges as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in neonatal sepsis, demonstrating good predictive capabilities."
41060555,Cerebrospinal Procalcitonin for Diagnosing Meningitis in Infants Less Than 90 Days: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2025,"CONTEXT: Early identification and treatment of meningitis in early infancy is crucial for improved outcomes. However, the commonly used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for diagnosing meningitis have poor diagnostic accuracy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic utility of CSF procalcitonin for diagnosing meningitis in infants with postnatal age less than 90 days. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from inception to 15 March 2025. We included observational studies that used CSF procalcitonin as a marker for diagnosing meningitis in infants with a postnatal age of less than 90 days. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2, and the certainty of evidence was ascertained using GRADE approach. The bivariate random effect model and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic meta-analysis were used to pool data with multiple thresholds. RESULTS: Out of 815 retrieved records, seven studies involving 963 infants were included in the meta-analysis. We obtained diagnostic accuracy measures at commonly used threshold cut-offs of 0.20 ng/mL and 0.33 ng/mL. At a CSF procalcitonin threshold cut-off of 0.20 ng/mL, the pooled sensitivity (95%CI) was 77.1% (49.2%, 92.1%), and the pooled specificity (95%CI) was 68.9% (49.2%, 83.5%). At a cut-off of 0.33 ng/mL, sensitivity was 75.8% (50.1%, 90.7%) and specificity was 75.1% (58.5%, 86.6%). The certainty of evidence remained very low for both sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: CSF procalcitonin has moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing meningitis in infants with postnatal age < 90 days. However, wide confidence intervals and very low certainty of evidence limit the reliability of these findings."
41060451,Hospital costs of different treatment strategies for anastomotic leakage after total mesorectal excision: a multicentre cost analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on hospital costs incurred by anastomotic leakage (AL), particularly in relation to specific treatment approaches. This study aimed to analyse the incremental hospital costs of AL after total mesorectal excision (TME), stratified by treatment strategy, over a 1-year time horizon. METHODS: Patients undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer (2020-2023), included in the control cohort of the IMARI-study at 15 Dutch centres, were analysed. A cost analysis was conducted according to Dutch National Healthcare Institute guidelines. The primary outcome was the incremental hospital costs incurred by patients with AL detected within 30 days postoperatively, stratified by treatment strategy. RESULTS: The analysis compared treatment costs in 32 patients with AL and 82 patients without AL. The average hospital costs per patient in the first postoperative year were euro15.312. In patients with AL, the mean incremental costs were euro24.333. Major cost drivers in the AL group were prolonged hospitalization (+euro13.150) and (re)interventions (+euro8.910). The treatment costs differed significantly between strategies: no faecal diversion (euro10.062), faecal diversion with passive drainage (euro23.903), faecal diversion with active drainage (euro35.552), and salvage surgery (euro38.793). CONCLUSIONS: AL after TME resulted in a nearly fourfold increase in hospital costs compared with patients without AL. Salvage surgery was the most expensive treatment strategy, followed by faecal diversion with active drainage. Future studies should evaluate how these treatment costs relate to clinical success rates, including rates of chronic pelvic sepsis and permanent stomas. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study used data from the IMARI-study. The IMARI-study is registered with the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (NL67600.018.18) and is submitted to the http://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en database (NL-OMON26456 and NL-OMON55903)."
41058681,Mechanistic study of the hsa_circ_0074158 binding EIF4A3 impairing sepsis-induced endothelial barrier.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a major clinical challenge, characterized by high rates of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. Its complex pathogenesis involves multiple factors, with damage to the vascular endothelial barrier being a key component. Currently, there are no widely accepted biomarkers that demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for sepsis, and treatment mainly focuses on supportive care without specific therapeutic targets. Recent research suggests that circRNA has potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. In previous studies, the harmful role of hsa_circ_0074158 in worsening sepsis-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction was demonstrated through both in vitro and in vivo models, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for sepsis. METHODS: This study examined how hsa_circ_0074158 affects endothelial barrier function in sepsis. The role of hsa_circ_0074158 (circ_Ctnna1 in mice) in sepsis-related endothelial barrier dysfunction was studied using both in vitro and in vivo models. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and actinomycin D experiments were used to show that circ_0074158 impacts endothelial barrier function in sepsis by reducing the stability of the host gene CTNNA1 (mRNA) after binding to EIF4A3. RESULTS: In both LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine models, the overexpression of hsa_circ_0074158 (the mouse homolog of hsa_circ_0074158 is named circ_Ctnna1) significantly decreased CTNNA1 mRNA stability and increased endothelial hyperpermeability, while its knockdown restored barrier integrity. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA RIP assays demonstrated that hsa_circ_0074158 directly binds to the RNA-binding protein (RBP) EIF4A3, which decreases the stability of CTNNA1 (mRNA) and the production of alpha-catenin, subsequently impairing endothelial barrier function in sepsis. Rescue experiments showed that dual targeting of hsa_circ_0074158 and EIF4A3 restored endothelial barrier function. The dysregulation of the hsa_circ_0074158/EIF4A3 axis exacerbates sepsis-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction by destabilizing CTNNA1 mRNA, posing a critical medical challenge due to its complex pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of sepsis and suggests potential therapeutic targets for its treatment. Further research is needed to explore the clinical application of these findings."
41057888,Fenofibrate alleviates sepsis-associated acute kidney injury by enhancing renal fatty acid oxidation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a common and severe complication in patients with severe health conditions, yet effective targeted therapies are still not available. Recent studies implicate impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and metabolic dysregulation in its pathogenesis. A clinically approved peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonist, fenofibrate, may improve energy metabolism and enhance renal FAO. This study investigated whether fenofibrate mitigates SA-AKI by restoring renal FAO and mitochondrial function. METHODS: The three groups (n = 6 per group) were as follows: control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SA-AKI, and LPS with fenofibrate pretreatment (0.2% dietary supplementation for 7 days), with male C57BL/6 mice used for the study. Kidney injury was induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection (10 mg/kg). After 24 hours, renal function (serum creatinine [Scr] and blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), inflammation (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1beta], interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), and histopathology were evaluated. Biomarkers of kidney injury, including kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), as well as indicators of energy metabolism (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) and lipid accumulation (triglycerides, glycerol, non-esterified fatty acids [NEFA]), were assessed. Mitochondrial function (citrate synthase), FAO capacity, and expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1alpha), PPARalpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), CPT2, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) were assessed. RESULTS: Fenofibrate markedly enhanced renal function, lowered levels of Scr and BUN, decreased proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibited the expression of KIM-1 and NGAL. Histological damage was alleviated, and Oil Red O staining revealed reduced lipid accumulation. ATP levels and citrate synthase activity were restored, while renal levels of triglycerides, glycerol, and NEFA were decreased. Fenofibrate increased the expression of genes and proteins associated with FAO and restored the AMPK-PGC1alpha-PPARalpha signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Fenofibrate attenuates SA-AKI by enhancing renal FAO and mitochondrial energy metabolism via the AMPK-PGC1alpha-PPARalpha pathway, supporting its potential as a metabolic therapy for SA-AKI.

41057395,Evidence for enhancer activity in intron 1 of TNFRSF1A using CRISPR/Cas9 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages.,2025,"TNFalpha is a common drug target in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with pro-inflammatory functions that are primarily mediated through its receptor, TNFRSF1A. TNFRSF1A has been genetically associated with many immune-mediated diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Many of the genetic variants within or near TNFRSF1A that have been associated with disease through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in non-coding regions of the genome. Understanding the functional consequences of these genetic variants is limited by incomplete understanding of TNFRSF1A gene regulation, including for specific cellular contexts relevant to inflammation and immunity such as macrophages. This work used CRISPR/Cas9 in human induced pluripotent stem cells followed by differentiation into macrophages to investigate putative regulatory elements in the TNFRSF1A gene locus. Through gene editing, with functional genomic readouts including the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and RNA-Seq to assess the consequences of these edits, we present evidence for an enhancer of TNFRSF1A contained within an intron of the gene. Understanding gene regulation and the genomic context in which GWAS variants lie could bring us closer to deconvoluting the genetic basis of common disease aetiology and uncover effective drug targets."
41057359,Plasma pancreatic stone protein is a promising biomarker for prognosis and severity outcome in sepsis patients with COVID-19.,2025,"Sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are life-threatening clinical syndromes with high mortality rate. This study aimed to investigate pancreatic stone protein (PSP) role as potential biomarker for sepsis/COVID-19 prognostication. Herein, based on the novel amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (AlphaLISA), the PSP plasma concentrations were determined, and the PSP diagnostic and prognostic values were characterized in a total of 285 patients with inflammatory disorders and 15 healthy volunteers. We found that plasma PSP protein was significantly overexpressed in patients with sepsis covid-positive (Sepsis(+ve), n = 105) compared to non-sepsis covid-negative (Non-Sepsis(-ve), n = 60), non-sepsis covid-positive (Non-Sepsis(+ve), n = 75), sepsis covid-negative (Sepsis(-ve), n = 45), and normal controls (NC, n = 15). PSP showed good prediction ability of Sepsis(+ve) short-term mortality, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8368 and 0.8070 at 28 and 90 days, respectively. Significant correlations were seen between plasma PSP and SOFA score, urea, immune mediators and inflammatory cytokines. Risk stratification analysis indicated higher mortality risk for Sepsis(+ve) with plasma PSP level exceeding the optimal cut-off value (>/= 119 ng/mL). PSP might be sepsis/COVID-19 disease biomarker, and could provide clinicians with a potential target for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
41054993,Prognostic value of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in trauma patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Trauma mortality exhibits three peaks: immediate, early, and late post-traumatic. Early deaths are often due to haemorrhage and central nervous system injury, whereas late deaths are associated with sepsis and multi-organ failure. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a readily available and inexpensive marker of inflammation, and its prognostic value under various conditions has been established. However, the predictive ability of the NLR in trauma mortality remains unclear, with conflicting results from previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between NLR (on admission and at 48-hour post-admission) and trauma outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data of trauma patients (>/= 18 years old) of which 372 were admitted to a level one trauma unit between January and June 2017. The data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), new injury severity score (NISS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), hospital length of stay (LOS), hospital disposition, and NLR values on admission and at 48 hours. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the association between the NLR and mortality, controlling for age, sex, ISS, and AIS. The sample size was calculated based on the anticipated mortality rate and desired power. RESULTS: The study included 288 patients for admission NLR analysis and 165 patients for the 48-hour NLR analysis. While factors such as ISS, NISS, emergency department (ED) probability of survival, NISS EU probability, and hospital disposition significantly predicted mortality, NLR at both 24 and 48 hours was not significantly associated with mortality. Although NLR showed good diagnostic accuracy, it did not improve the predictive power of the models, including established prognostic factors. The small sample size for 48-hour NLR analysis is a limitation. CONCLUSION: Although the NLR is a simple indicator of systemic inflammation, this study found that it does not independently predict mortality in trauma patients when other established prognostic markers are included. These findings suggest that NLR has limited additional prognostic value in this context, highlighting the importance of incorporating established injury severity scores and other clinical factors for accurate mortality risk assessment. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential role of the NLR in predicting other trauma outcomes."
41054625,Prognostic Value of SIRI in Sepsis: A Retrospective Study and Machine Learning-Based Model Development.,2025,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) has demonstrated unique advantages in evaluating sepsis prognosis. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of SIRI for 28-day outcomes in sepsis patients, and develop and validate a prognostic model for 28-day mortality. METHODS: The demographic characteristics, disease severity, laboratory tests, treatments, and outcome measures were recorded from the adult sepsis patients. The restricted cubic splines and the ROC curve analysis were employed to evaluate the relationship and predictive capability of SIRI. Next, SIRI was categorized into tertiles, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess its association with prognosis, supplemented by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, and compare mortality differences. Patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were randomly allocated into training and internal validation sets at a 3:1 ratio, using the Boruta algorithm and LASSO regression and a prognostic model was constructed via logistic regression, while patients from the First People's Hospital of Zhangjiagang City served as the external validation set. Then, the predictive performance, accuracy, and clinical utility of the model were validated using the ROC curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The 380 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and 240 patients from the First People's Hospital of Zhangjiagang City were enrolled for the present study. The restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a nonlinear increasing trend in mortality risk with rising SIRI levels. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SIRI has superior predictive capability than the APACHE II and SOFA scores. When SIRI was categorized into tertiles, both the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified SIRI as significantly associated to 28-day prognosis (p<0.001). The K-M curves further confirmed that higher SIRI levels correlated to lower 28-day survival rates (p<0.001). In the training set, the Boruta algorithm combined with LASSO regression selected six independent risk factors: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), age, phosphorus (P), lactate (Lac), mechanical ventilation (MV), and SIRI. These were incorporated into the predictive model through logistic regression analysis. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the model exhibited good predictive performance across the training set (AUC: 0.851), internal validation set (AUC: 0.908), and external validation set (AUC: 0.792). The calibration of the model was verified using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration curve, while DCA was performed to confirm its clinical utility. CONCLUSION: SIRI is significantly correlated to the 28-day prognosis in sepsis patients, and has excellent predictive value for short-term outcomes. The prediction model that incorporated SIRI exhibited high prognostic accuracy."
41053042,Research advances on the role of programmed endothelial cell death in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by a dysregulated host immune response to pathogenic organisms and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. According to the most recent sepsis guidelines, effective monitoring and therapeutic strategies remain insufficient, leading to suboptimal patient outcomes. Endothelial cells (ECs) constitute a critical pathophysiological nexus in sepsis pathogenesis, wherein their dysregulation disrupts both microvascular homeostasis and endothelial barrier competence. During sepsis, aberrant activation of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways in ECs induces both structural and functional disruptions, thereby enhancing vascular permeability, causing hemodynamic instability, promoting systemic circulatory dysfunction, and compromising tissue perfusion. These pathophysiological derangements potentiate a vicious cycle of systemic inflammatory amplification, exacerbate disseminated intravascular coagulation, and culminate in lethal multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This comprehensive review systematically evaluates contemporary insights into the molecular pathophysiology of PCD pathways in endothelial cells during sepsis, with particular emphasis on their mechanistic interplay and therapeutic implications, providing an in-depth understanding of their contributions to sepsis pathophysiology. Additionally, we explore the potential of key PCD-associated molecules as biomarkers for monitoring and evaluating vascular function and permeability in septic patients. Finally, we discuss the current state of drug development targeting ECs' PCD and their prospective therapeutic implications for sepsis, offering valuable insights for future basic research and clinical applications."
41052967,Urinary immune biomarkers for late-onset sepsis in preterm very low birth weight neonates - a diagnostic accuracy study.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of urinary immune biomarkers (IBM) for late-onset sepsis (LOS) in very preterm infants. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, included preterm infants <32 weeks of gestation and birth weight <1,500 g, needing evaluation for suspected LOS. Urine samples obtained concurrent to blood culture and sepsis screen were evaluated for interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels using enzyme immunoassay. Positive blood and/or CSF culture served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate performance of urinary IBM for detection of LOS. RESULTS: During September 2021-September 2023, we evaluated 136 preterm, very low birth weight infants (mean gestational age: 28.2 weeks, mean birth weight: 933 g) for sepsis after 72 h of postnatal age and prior to 37 weeks postmenstrual age. Twenty four infants had culture-positive sepsis. Median IL-8 and MCP-1 levels in neonates with LOS were 86.5 pg/mL and 230.2 pg/mL and those in non-infected neonates were 66.5 pg/mL and 212.1 pg/mL. Urinary IL-8 had sensitivity and specificity of 42 and 51 % [AUC: 0.46 (0.35-0.57)] and urinary MCP-1 had sensitivity and specificity of 46 and 53 % [AUC: 0.49 (0.38-0.60)] for detection of LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary IL-8 and MCP-1 had low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of LOS in very preterm infants. These findings underscore the need to establish reference ranges for urinary IBM in preterm neonates."
41050938,Integrated analysis of stem cell-related genes shared between type 2 diabetes mellitus and sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes-induced immune impairment and insulin resistance increase infection risk, which may progress to sepsis that further deteriorates diabetic status. Stem cell-based interventions show therapeutic potential for both diseases. This study sought to uncover common stem cell-related genes (SCRGs) between T2DM and sepsis. METHODS: The GSE15932 dataset for T2DM and GSE65682 dataset for sepsis from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were utilized to locate common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then intersected with SCRGs to derive shared differentially expressed SCRGs (DE-SCRGs). The stem-cell-related biomarkers were discovered through combining functional similarity analysis, machine learning algorithms, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Subsequently, functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, and single-cell analyses were conducted to investigate the potential pathways by which biomarkers regulate T2DM and sepsis. Finally, the expression of biomarkers was further verified at both transcriptional and protein levels through the establishment of an in vitro model of T2DM-sepsis. RESULTS: Through a comprehensive analysis, CAPG and DDAH2 were found and those were significantly highly expressed in both T2DM and sepsis. Analysis of functional enrichment demonstrated they were implicated in ""FC gamma R-mediated phagocytosis"" and ""Ribosome"". Immune infiltration indicated a considerable disparity in the quantity of CD8 T cells and monocytes when comparing T2DM versus control groups, as well as sepsis versus control groups. At the cellular level, notable differences in CARG expression among alpha cells, beta cells, delta cells, and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) were observed in the two groups being compared. At transcription and protein levels, CAPG and DDAH2 were significantly more highly expressed in the T2DM-sepsis model than in the controls. The results corroborated the bioinformatics analysis conclusions, reinforcing the study's validity. CONCLUSION: Two common stem cell-related biomarkers (CAPG and DDAH2) and their common pathways between T2DM and sepsis were discovered, providing new insights for further molecular mechanism studies."
41049914,Artificial Intelligence in Prehospital Emergency Care: Advancing Triage and Destination Decisions for Time-Critical Conditions.,2025,"Prehospital triage is critical for time-sensitive emergencies such as trauma, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome. Undertriage delays definitive care, while overtriage strains higher-level facilities. Existing triage tools based on vital signs and scoring systems have limited accuracy, but artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and neural networks (NN) offer the potential to improve decision-making by integrating multiple data sources. This narrative review of studies indexed in PubMed and PubMed Central through August 2025 evaluated AI, ML, and NN models designed for prehospital triage or transport destination decisions across trauma, critical illness, stroke, dyspnea, cardiac emergencies, sepsis, and in-hospital studies preventing possible readmission. Across the conditions examined, ML models consistently outperformed traditional early warning scores and guideline-based tools. Trauma models achieved area under the curve (AUC) values between 0.75 and 0.93 and reduced undertriage to less than 10%. ML models predicted the need for critical care with an AUC of 0.908, and prehospital stroke algorithms reached AUCs above 0.98. NN, deep forest, and random forest models demonstrated an AUC of 0.88 in prehospital acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) prediction. Additional studies demonstrated improved recognition of dyspnea-related serious events and acute coronary syndrome, while no validated models currently exist for prehospital sepsis. Despite promising results, most studies were retrospective, with limited prospective validation, generalizability, or evaluation of workflow integration. Future research should focus on prospective studies, diverse patient cohorts, integration into emergency medical service (EMS) workflows, model explainability, and rigorous comparisons with standard practice."
41049485,Under the background of the new global definition of ARDS: an interpretable machine learning approach for predicting 28-day ICU mortality in patients with sepsis complicated by ARDS.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent clinical complication among patients with sepsis, characterized by high incidence and mortality rates. The definition of ARDS has evolved over time, with the new global definition introducing significant updates to its diagnosis and treatment. Our objective is to develop and validate an interpretable prediction model for the prognosis of sepsis patients complicated by ARDS, utilizing machine learning techniques in accordance with the new global definition. METHODS: This study extracted data from the MIMIC database (version MIMIC-IV 2.2) to create the training set for our model. For external validation, this study used data from sepsis patients complicated by ARDS who met the new global definition of ARDS, sourced from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Lasso regression with cross-validation was used to identify key predictors of patient prognosis. Subsequently, this study established models to predict the 28-day prognosis following ICU admission using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, support vector machine classifier, LightGBM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Model performance was assessed using ROC curves, clinical decision curves (DCA), and calibration curves, while SHAP values were utilized to interpret the machine learning models. RESULTS: A total of 905 patients with sepsis complicated by ARDS were included in our analysis, leading to the selection of 15 key variables for model development. Based on the AUC of the ROC curve, as well as DCA and calibration curve results from the training set, the support vector classifier (SVC) model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.792 in the internal validation set and 0.816 in the external validation set. CONCLUSION: The application of machine learning methodologies to construct prognostic prediction models for sepsis patients complicated by ARDS, informed by the new global definition, proves to be reliable. This approach can assist clinicians in developing personalized treatment strategies for affected patients."
41049088,MicroRNA mapping of bronchial aspirate for molecular phenotyping and prognostication in patients on mechanical ventilation.,2025,"The application of microRNA (miRNA) profiling in respiratory biospecimens, particularly bronchial aspirate (BAS), remains underexplored. Here, we aimed to validate and refine miRNA quantification in BAS samples to establish its suitability for molecular phenotyping. This was a multicenter study including 288 COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Respiratory biospecimens included BAS, tracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. A predesigned miRNA panel was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Biomarker evaluation and functional assessment were subsequently conducted. An initial technical validation phase corroborated the reproducibility of miRNA profiling in BAS samples. Comparative analyses of miRNA expression profiles across respiratory samples revealed distinct miRNA patterns among biospecimens. In the biomarker analysis, two miRNA ratios, miR-34c-5p/miR-34a-5p and miR-34c-5p/miR-125b-5p, were inversely associated with intensive care unit (ICU) survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.18 and 0.17, respectively) during the discovery phase. Risk and survival analyses in the test phase confirmed the reproducibility of the miR-34c-5p/miR-34a-5p ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.17). Functional analyses revealed the utility of miRNA profiling in BAS for identifying pathogenic pathways and developing therapeutic targets. Overall, these findings position miRNA profiling in BAS samples as a valuable approach for biomarker discovery, identification of pathophysiological mechanisms, and development of targeted pulmonary therapies."
41045582,Glycocalyx shedding as a clinical biomarker in critical illness.,2025,"The endothelial glycocalyx, a carbohydrate-rich layer lining the vascular endothelium, plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by regulating permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and inflammatory signaling. Its degradation has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and organ damage in various diseases. Biomarkers derived from glycocalyx components, particularly Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) and heparan sulfate (HS), can be detected in blood and urine, providing a potential window into vascular injury. In this narrative review, we explore the clinical potential of glycocalyx-derived biomarkers, with a focus on SDC-1, in a broad spectrum of conditions, including sepsis, coronavirus disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney diseases, cardiovascular disorders, autoimmune diseases, cancer, trauma, and pregnancy-related complications. We highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms of glycocalyx degradation, assess the diagnostic and prognostic utility of SDC-1, and summarize emerging therapeutic strategies to preserve glycocalyx integrity. Given their strong association with disease severity and outcomes, glycocalyx-derived biomarkers may enable earlier diagnosis, improved risk stratification, and personalized treatment, supporting more informed clinical decision-making across diverse medical conditions."
41044321,Portable 3D-printed electrochemiluminescence sensor for simultaneous glucose and lactate monitoring.,2025,"Fast and reliable monitoring of metabolic biomarkers, including glucose and lactate, is critical for chronic diseases, sepsis, and other scenarios involving physiological stress. However, most diagnostic options depend on multiple serial tests, require complicated testing apparatus, and are too expensive to be useful in the point-of-care arena. To address these limitations, we present a portable, low-cost, and 3D-printed (3DP) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor capable of simultaneously detecting glucose and lactate in a single step. The biosensor incorporates interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) within a bipolar electrode (BPE) electrochemical system to enhance electron transfer and signal amplification. Through careful optimization of voltage, luminol concentration, and pH, strong and reproducible ECL signals were achieved, with detection limits of 0.1 mM for glucose (linear range 0.1 mM to 5.0 mM) and 80 microM for lactate (linear range 0.1 mM to 4.0 mM). Real serum analysis yielded 95-102% recovery rates, validating the device's clinical relevance. Combining an inexpensive smartphone-based readout and fabricated with low-cost carbon and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments, this device offers a scalable and field-deployable approach to real-time, decentralized diagnostics. The proposed prototype fills a critical void between laboratory analysis and standard healthcare needs and promotes accessible and affordable metabolic monitoring for underserved populations."
41043508,Estimation of risk-adjusted postoperative infection outcomes using interpretable machine learning and electronic health record data.,2026,"BACKGROUND: This study compared risk-adjusted postoperative infection outcomes estimated by statistical models applied to electronic health record (EHR) data (""automated"") to gold-standard manual chart review outcomes estimated by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). METHODS: 307,335 adult patients who underwent 441,047 operations in nine surgical specialties at five large hospitals between 2013-2019 were included. Records from 30,603 patients were linked to the local ACS-NSQIP database (97% linkage). Previously published models for estimating preoperative risk and occurrence of postoperative infections were used to estimate observed-to-expected event ratios (O/E) for surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, sepsis/septic shock, and pneumonia. RESULTS: O/E ratios were similar when comparing automated methods to ACS-NSQIP across 5 hospitals and 4 infection types. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the hospital O/E ratios was 0.77, mean absolute difference was 0.13%, and 100% of the confidence intervals were overlapping. The correlations and mean absolute differences for individual infection types improved as incidence rates increased. DISCUSSION: Parsimonious statistical models applied to EHR data can be used to accurately estimate hospital risk-adjusted postoperative infection outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These models could be used to augment postoperative infection surveillance for hospital quality monitoring."
41042192,Sysmex Cell Population Data for Diagnosing Infection in Patients With Suspected Sepsis in the Emergency Department.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of suspected sepsis is crucial to improve patient survival. Cell population (CP) data, a set of leucocyte research parameters from hematology instruments, has a potential as markers for infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy for infection of CP variables from Sysmex XN instruments in patients with suspected sepsis in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Adult patients with suspected sepsis in the ED were included. CP variables, C-reactive protein (CRP), and post hoc assessments of infection were recorded. Logistic regression and machine learning methods were used to develop multivariable models, which were evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and calibration plots. RESULTS: The development cohort and the validation cohort consisted of 600 and 656 patients, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that complexity in monocytes (MO-X); AUC of 0.78 (0.74, 0.82), reactivity intensity of neutrophils (NEUT-RI); 0.72 (0.67, 0.76), and CRP 0.87 (0.84, 0.90) had the highest diagnostic accuracy for infection. A final multivariable model (the optimal model) using Multilayer perceptron (MLP), including MO-X, NEUT-RI, monocyte size (MO-Z), and neutrophil size (NE-FSC), had an AUC of 0.86 (0.85, 0.87) in the development cohort and 0.78 (0.74, 0.82) in the validation cohort with reasonable calibration. Including CRP in this model further improved accuracy and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Sysmex CP variables may help diagnose infections in the ED. However, the lack of well-described calibration procedures and quality assurance for non-IVD approved CP variables is an impediment to clinical implementation."
41041634,"The role of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in modulating sepsis progression: identification of key targets and biomarkers through multi-database data mining, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as alpha-hydroxybutyrate (alpha-HB), may play a critical role in the progression of sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying alpha-HB's involvement in sepsis remain unclear. This study aims to explore the targets of alpha-HB and their association with sepsis progression using multi-database data mining, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering analyses. METHODS: alpha-HB-related targets were identified through comprehensive data mining from three databases: SEA, SuperPred, and SwissTargetPrediction. Sepsis-related targets were obtained from the GEO dataset GSE26440, and the intersection of these datasets was analyzed to reveal common targets. Functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and machine learning algorithms (L1-LASSO, RF, and SVM) were applied to identify biomarkers. Additionally, a nomogram was constructed to predict sepsis progression. Clustering, GSVA, and ssGSEA analyses were performed to explore sepsis subtypes. Molecular docking simulations was conducted to investigate interactions between alpha-HB and key targets. RESULTS: A total of 42 common targets were identified between alpha-HB and sepsis, with significant enrichment in pathways related to immune response, hypoxia, and cancer. Machine learning-based feature selection identified four robust biomarkers (APEX1, CTSD, SLC40A1, PIK3CB) associated with sepsis. The constructed nomogram demonstrated high predictive accuracy for sepsis risk. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct alpha-HB-related sepsis subtypes with differential immune cell infiltration patterns and pathway activities, particularly involving immune and inflammatory pathways. Subtype 1 was predominantly associated with non-survivors, while Subtype 2 was more frequent among survivors, showing a significant difference in survival status. Molecular docking analysis further indicated potential interactions between alpha-HB and key targets (APEX1, CTSD, SLC40A1, PIK3CB), providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of alpha-HB in sepsis. CONCLUSION: This study identifies key alpha-HB-related targets and biomarkers for sepsis, offering new insights into its pathophysiology. The findings highlight the potential of alpha-HB in modulating immune responses and suggest that alpha-HB-related targets could serve as promising therapeutic targets for sepsis management."
41040989,Decreasing Procalcitonin and Its Ratio to Albumin Predict Mortality in Patients with Abdominal Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Abdominal sepsis may act as a life-threatening disease characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory response and nutritional deficits. Given the complex interplay between inflammation and malnutrition, integrating these biomarkers may provide a more comprehensive understanding of patients' outcomes and improve early prognosis in the intensive care unit (ICU). Herein, we report the predictive value of procalcitonin (PCT) and its ratio to albumin (ALB) for mortality of abdominal sepsis patients, aiming to provide more references for clinical disease management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving one hundred and twenty-four patients diagnosed with abdominal sepsis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was utilized to analyze the 30- and 90-day mortality of patients. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to confirm the prognostic factors. In addition, ROC analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS: An 80% decrease of PCT within 4 days was identified as a cutoff to predict the 30-day (P = 0.032) and 90-day mortality (P = 0.030) with the help of Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the PCT decrease/ALB was an independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality (P <0.05) and 90-day mortality (P <0.05) before and after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. Moreover, ROC analysis revealed the significance of PCT and PCT decrease/ALB in predicting 30-day and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the decrease in PCT and the ratio of PCT decrease/ALB are promising biomarkers to predict mortality in patients with abdominal sepsis."
41040784,Combined Predictive Value of Serum Procalcitonin and Platelet Indices in Differentiating Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections.,2025," Sepsis is caused by bloodstream infections (BSIs) and potentially results in death. Parameters like platelet (PLT) indices and procalcitonin (PCT) are common inflammatory markers used for the diagnosis and assessment of sepsis. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the predictive value of combined serum PCT and PLT indices to differentiate the host responses of Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) and Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in BSIs.  Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Critical Care and General Medicine Department of Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, by including 385 BSI-diagnosed patients consecutively over the period of two years. All patients were more than 18 years of age and had culture-positive sepsis diagnosed based on the sepsis-3 criteria. Laboratory investigations such as complete blood count, serum PCT, and bacterial cultures for GPB and GNB, were done and correlated with clinical features. In statistical analysis, univariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression analysis) were done, and a multivariate regression model was proposed by combining PCT and PLT indices for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative BSI cases.  Results: BSI cases were confirmed from culture-positive. Out of 385 BSI cases, 51.9% were Gram-negative and 48.05% were Gram-positive. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms. A significantly higher level was observed in hematological parameters such as white blood cell count (WBC) (18.02 cells/microL +/- 9.06) and PLT indices; mean platelet volume (MPV) (12.24 fL +/- 2.02), PLT (159.11 x 10(3 )mcl +/- 76.7); and platelet distribution width (PDW) (14.13 fL +/- 13.03) in GNB. Elevated levels were also observed in PCT (37.20 +/- 40.4 microg/L), a key biomarker for bacterial infection and sepsis. Generalized linear model (GLM) based on the combined value of the above significant hematological parameters demonstrates a strong ability to discriminate GNB infection, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8644. The optimal threshold for this model is 0.433, which provides a balanced sensitivity and specificity, both at 0.80. The high value of the AUC indicates the potential utility of the GLM-based prediction tool to classify the GNB infection.  Conclusion: A multi-biomarker linear model, by combining PCT, WBC, MPV, PDW, and PLT-derived ratios, can effectively differentiate Gram-negative from Gram-positive BSIs. Elevated PCT, WBC, and PLT indices indicate Gram-negative infections."
41039708,Utility of Shock Index and Pediatric Age-Adjusted Shock Index in Predicting Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Early recognition of severe sepsis and septic shock in the pediatric emergency department (PED) is crucial for the success of early targeted therapy. The shock index (SI) and pediatric age-adjusted shock index (SIPA) are promising noninvasive tools for early risk stratification. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of SI, SIPA, and modified indexes in severe outcomes. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included 238 pediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years who met systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Clinical findings and vital signs were collected at presentation. SI, SIPA, and modified indices were calculated using heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Biomarkers, including lactate and immature granulocyte percentage (IG%), were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 238 patients, 49 (20.6%) had severe sepsis or septic shock. SI >/=1.81 showed an AUC of 0.815, sensitivity of 81.6%, and specificity of 67.7%. SIPA had a sensitivity of 91.8% but a lower specificity (45.0%). Pediatric Shock Index and Temperature-adjusted and Age-adjusted Mean Shock Index had AUCs of 0.443 and 0.734, respectively. Age-specific SI cutoffs improved predictive performance, particularly in younger children. Combining SI with IG% or lactate enhances diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: SI and SIPA are practical tools for early recognition of severe sepsis in children. Age-adjusted SI cutoffs improve accuracy. Diagnostic performance was further enhanced when combined with IG% and lactate, supporting their integration in PED clinical decision-making."
41039248,Impact of complement system proteins on the clinical progression of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The complement system is an important defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses. In COVID-19, evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and provoke dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in vascular damage observed in severe COVID-19. There is still little evidence regarding the role of plasma levels of these molecules in the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study included individuals 18 years of age or older with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted to two referral hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil between August 2020 and July 2021. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were followed up until discharge, and complications during hospitalization were duly recorded. Plasma levels of the following complement proteins were determined by Luminex: C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to correct the results according to possible confounding factors. RESULTS: The study included 267 patients (134 critical and 133 severe), with mean ages of 54 and 52 years, respectively. Plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in patients who required intensive care unit admission, required ventilatory support, developed sepsis, developed cardiorespiratory arrest, or developed acute kidney failure. On the other hand, C4b level was lower in patients who developed complications. Complement proteins were significantly associated with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the complement system is associated with COVID-19 complications and laboratory parameters of coagulation and kidney function. These results suggest that these molecules may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the clinical progression of COVID-19."
41038928,Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury in mice and humans elicits heterogeneous renal microvascular microRNA responses.,2025,"Microvascular endothelial cells play important roles in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). In this study, we focused on microvascular microRNAs changes following SA-AKI to identify microRNAs as novel druggable targets and microvasculature-related early biomarkers of SA-AKI. Using small RNA sequencing we identified 40 differentially expressed microRNAs in the renal microvasculature in response to SA-AKI. While the induction of most microRNAs was restricted to a single microvascular compartment, miR-21-5p levels were increased across the renal microvasculature in both mice and humans following SA-AKI. Functional assessment in vitro revealed that inhibition of hsa-miR-21-5p exacerbated endothelial inflammatory activation, suggesting a protective role of this microRNA in endothelial cells. Furthermore, patients with SA-AKI exhibited elevated hsa-miR-21-5p levels in plasma compared with critically ill sepsis patients without AKI. These results highlight the potential of hsa-miR-21-5p and other microRNAs as therapeutic targets and biomarkers in SA-AKI."
41038278,A distinctive immunophenotypic signature in thrombocytopenic septic patients: platelet and neutrophil dysregulations as key contributors to disease severity.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is frequently associated with increased mortality in sepsis; however, the underlying immunological mechanisms remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: This study characterizes molecular and phenotypic changes associated with thrombocytopenia in sepsis, focusing on platelets (PLTs), neutrophils, and their interactions, and evaluates their contributions to poor outcomes. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 19 healthy donors, 27 nonthrombocytopenic (N-TP) and 22 thrombocytopenic (TP) patients with community-acquired sepsis at baseline (diagnosis), and at 24, 48, and 72 hours after admission. Plasma levels of PLT-derived mediators and neutrophil surrogate markers were quantified by ELISA. PLT and neutrophil phenotypes and neutrophil degranulation were assessed by flow cytometry, while extracellular DNA release, as a surrogate approximation of NETosis, was measured by SYTOX Green fluorescence and validated by myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA ELISA. RESULTS: TP patients showed higher percentages of PD-L1(+) PLTs and increased CXCR4 expression on PLTs compared with N-TP patients. Their plasma also contained elevated soluble P-selectin and vascular endothelial growth factor levels. Compared with healthy donors, TP patients exhibited fewer neutrophil-PLT complexes; however, a greater proportion of these complexes were PD-L1(+) and expressed higher CXCR4 levels than those in N-TP patients. Despite reduced extracellular DNA release upon stimulation, TP patients had higher plasma MPO-DNA complexes and MPO, neutrophil elastase, and S100A8/A9 levels. Clinically, TP patients had worse outcomes, with lower soluble CD40L levels and impaired in vitro extracellular DNA release correlating with disease severity (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >/=8). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a distinct immune signature in TP septic patients, defined by enhanced PLT activation and neutrophil dysfunction, potentially contributing to poor prognosis."
41036208,Applications of artificial intelligence in early childhood health management: a systematic review from fetal to pediatric periods.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into early childhood health management has expanded rapidly, with applications spanning the fetal, neonatal, and pediatric periods. While numerous studies report promising results, a comprehensive synthesis of AI's performance, methodological quality, and translational readiness in child health is needed. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to evaluate the current landscape of AI applications in fetal and pediatric care, assess their diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility, and identify key barriers to real-world implementation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between January 2021 and March 2025. Eligible studies involved AI-driven models for diagnosis, prediction, or decision support in individuals aged 0-18 years. Study selection followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Data were extracted on application domain, AI methodology, performance metrics, validation strategy, and clinical integration level. RESULTS: From 4,938 screened records, 133 studies were included. AI models demonstrated high performance in prenatal anomaly detection (mean AUC: 0.91-0.95), neonatal intensive care (e.g., sepsis prediction with sensitivity up to 89%), and pediatric genetic diagnosis (accuracy: 85%-93% using facial analysis). Deep learning enhanced consistency in fetal echocardiography and ultrasound interpretation. However, 76% of studies used single-center retrospective data, and only 21% reported external validation. Performance dropped by 15%-20% in cross-institutional settings. Fewer than 5% of models have been integrated into routine clinical workflows, with limited reporting on data privacy, algorithmic bias, and clinician trust. CONCLUSION: AI holds transformative potential across the pediatric continuum of care-from fetal screening to chronic disease management. However, most applications remain in the research phase, constrained by data heterogeneity, lack of prospective validation, and insufficient regulatory alignment. To advance clinical adoption, future efforts should focus on multicenter collaboration, standardized data sharing frameworks, explainable AI, and pediatric-specific regulatory pathways. This review provides a roadmap for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to guide the responsible translation of AI in child health."
41035784,Plasmin-mediated proteolysis of von Willebrand factor in patients with acute and chronic liver disease.,2025,"BACKGROUND: In patients with acute and chronic liver disease, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen levels are markedly elevated, whereas a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13 (ADAMTS13) activity is often reduced. The role of VWF proteolysis by other proteases, such as plasmin, remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether plasmin-mediated VWF cleavage occurs in patients with acute and chronic liver disease and to assess its association with VWF parameters, ADAMTS13 activity, and fibrinolytic markers. METHODS: Plasma samples from 191 patients with stable or decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure or acute liver injury, acute-on-chronic liver failure, or sepsis without underlying chronic liver disease and 41 healthy controls were analyzed. VWF antigen and collagen-binding activity, ADAMTS13 antigen and activity, ADAMTS13-cleaved VWF, plasmin-cleaved VWF (cVWF), plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complexes, and D-dimer were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: VWF antigen levels were higher in all patient groups and increased with disease severity. VWF activity was also elevated but was not proportional to VWF antigen level. ADAMTS13 activity and specific activity decreased with worsening disease. cVWF was undetectable in healthy controls and patients with stable cirrhosis but was increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure or injury, and acute-on-chronic liver failure. cVWF levels correlated with D-dimer but not with plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complexes or VWF activity. CONCLUSION: cVWF is detectable in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure or injury, and acute-on-chronic liver failure but not in those with stable cirrhosis or healthy individuals. Its association with D-dimer supports a link with fibrinolytic activation. These findings suggest that cVWF may reflect disease severity or ongoing microvascular thrombosis in patients with advanced liver disease."
41034327,Angiopoietin-2 adsorption attempt with the cytokine adsorber cytosorb in critically ill patients.,2025,"Angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) is a growth factor in angiogenesis, causing pericyte migration and vascular regression, leading to increased vascular permeability. Inflammatory mediators, hypoxia, hyperglycaemia and cancer stimulate its secretion. Particularly in sepsis, high Ang-2 levels appear to be a prognostic marker for morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. As an important trigger for endothelial damage one therapeutic option in these patients might be the removal of Ang-2. The Cyto-SOLVE trial included patients with septic shock or rhabdomyolsis treated with the adsorber Cytosorb (CS) (included in continuous kidney replacement therapy) for the removal of cytokines and myoglobin. Ang-2 was measured in the patient s blood and pre- and post-CS at defined time points (ten minutes, one, three, six, and twelve hours after initiation). Ang-2 extracorporeal clearances (ml/min) were calculated with: [Formula: see text] U-Test was used to compare different subgroups. 26 patients were included (17 with rhabdomyolsis and 9 with septic shock, median Ang-2 concentration prior to CS-application: 21,653 pg/ml). We observed a low Ang-2 adsorption in the first hour of CS application, resulting in a median Ang-2 extracorporeal clearance of 8.2 ml/min and 1.7 ml/min after 10 min and 1 h, respectively. There was no significant change in Ang-2 plasma concentrations at any time point. No significant difference in Ang-2 levels was observed between patients with septic shock (median: 31,916 pg/ml) and rhabdomyolysis (median 18,379 pg/ml, p = 0.241). The Cytosorb adsorber does not decrease Ang-2 concentrations by adsorption. Therefore, Ang-2 can be considered a reliable biomarker for endothelial dysfunction even in the presence of Cytosorb therapy in critically ill patients. Further studies should be conducted to determine whether the removal of Ang-2 could be beneficial when utilizing an appropriate device."
41033770,Correlation between complete blood count-derived inflammatory markers and sepsis-associated delirium in older patients: a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between complete blood count (CBC)-derived inflammatory markers and sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) risk in older intensive care unit (ICU) patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2008-2019), using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV V.3.0 database. PARTICIPANTS: 3412 critically ill patients aged >/=65 years with sepsis. EXCLUSION: repeated ICU admission, death/discharge within 24 hours, missing delirium assessment or pre-sepsis delirium from non-septic aetiologies. SAD was diagnosed by Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of sepsis-associated delirium. RESULTS: Among 3412 older sepsis patients, 2092 (61.3%) developed SAD. Significant differences in platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammation index, systemic inflammation response index, pan-immune-inflammation value and neutrophil-monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio were observed between SAD and non-SAD groups (all p<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, elevated levels of these markers were associated with increased SAD risk, with MLR showing the strongest association (Q4 vs Q1 adjusted OR=2.66, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.30). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed non-linear associations between inflammatory marker levels and SAD risk (p for non-linear <0.001). The results of most subgroup analyses were consistent, indicating that the association between inflammatory markers and SAD had high stability (p for interaction >0.05). Receiver operating characteristic and random forest analyses demonstrated predictive utility; incorporating markers into a baseline model significantly improved discrimination, with MLR providing the largest gain (area under the curve (AUC)=0.716 vs 0.703; DeltaAUC=0.013, DeLong test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: CBC-derived inflammatory markers, particularly MLR, are associated with increased SAD risk in older adults and enhance the performance of a clinical prediction model in this population. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these associations."
41033449,Nucleated red blood cells as a prognostic marker for mortality in septic critically ill patients: An observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in the blood of critically ill patients are associated with increased mortality. The predictive value of NRBCs among septic critically ill patients remains indistinct. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the predictive validity of NRBCs in septic critically ill patients. METHODS: Data from septic critically ill patients were collected between 2020 and 2023. Daily NRBC values were recorded, and their predictive validity for mortality was statistically analysed. A cut-off level based on the maximum NRBC value during the patients' intensive care unit (ICU) stay was determined using ROC analysis and Youden's method. Survival was depicted using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: 465 septic critically ill patients were analysed. Patients who died had significantly higher maximum NRBC values during their ICU stay compared to survivors (290/microL [60/2010] vs. 30/microL [10/170]; p < 0.001). A cut-off of maximum NRBCs of >/=100/microL effectively divided the study population into two groups with the most significant difference in ICU mortality (AUC 0.745; 95% CI 0.693-0.797; p < 0.001). Increased maximum NRBC values of >/=100/microL were associated with fivefold higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 5.03; 95% CI 3.19-7.90; p < 0.001). Higher mortality rates were confirmed using a Cox proportional-hazards model (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84; 95% CI 1.16-2.98; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring NRBCs can help predict mortality in septic critically ill patients with high prognostic accuracy. A cut-off of >/=100/microL for NRBCs appears to effectively stratify the study population regarding mortality."
41033340,The MicroRNA network in sepsis: from biomarker discovery to novel targeted therapeutic strategies.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome triggered by infection and mediated by host immune dysregulation. Its complex pathophysiological mechanisms and the lack of effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches make it a major challenge for the global healthcare system. As key molecules in post-transcriptional gene regulation, microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in immune dyshomeostasis, inflammatory storms, and organ damage during sepsis, and have emerged as a research focus in this field in recent years. This review summarizes the research progress of miRNAs in sepsis, with a focus on their expression characteristics, regulatory mechanisms, and clinical translational value. miRNAs regulate inflammatory responses by targeting core signaling pathways such as the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway. The specific mechanisms include: blocking upstream pathway activation by targeting TLR ligands or adaptor proteins; directly regulating NF-kappaB subunits to inhibit the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes; modulating negative feedback loops; and interacting with other signaling cascades. Furthermore, certain miRNAs act as both key regulators of immune responses and potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. In terms of organ damage, miRNAs display organ-specific characteristics by working as specific regulatory molecules in sepsis-associated cardiac, hepatic, and cerebral injuries. They affect organ function by targeting pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT). In terms of clinical translational value, miRNAs derived from human serum/plasma have shown significant potential in sepsis diagnosis, treatment guidance, and prognosis prediction. By dissecting the regulatory network of miRNAs in sepsis, this review not only provides a theoretical basis for understanding the complex pathophysiology of sepsis but also identifies key directions for developing miRNA-based precision diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (e.g. combined detection of multiple biomarkers and targeted delivery systems). It is anticipated to offer novel solutions for improving the prognosis of sepsis patients and reducing mortality."
41030712,Hemodynamic Patterns in Septic Cardiomyopathy: Insights From Echocardiographic Parameters and Biomarker Analysis.,2025,"Introduction Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) refers to an acute, reversible impairment of cardiac performance. This study aimed to evaluate hemodynamic patterns in SCM using echocardiographic parameters and cardiac biomarkers in critically ill patients. Materials and methods A 12-month prospective observational study was conducted at a single tertiary care center in Peshawar, Pakistan. Adult ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) within 48 hours of admission, with a repeat study on day 5 or earlier if clinically indicated. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic functions were assessed, including global longitudinal strain (GLS) and RV free-wall strain. High-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured on days 1 and 3. Associations between cardiac dysfunction and in-hospital mortality were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression after adjusting for age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and vasopressor use. Results Among 122 patients, the prevalence of SCM, defined by LV GLS > -17%, was high, with concurrent RV dysfunction observed in a significant proportion. Elevated hs-TnI and NT-proBNP levels correlated with impaired GLS and adverse outcomes. After multivariable adjustment, GLS impairment and elevated NT-proBNP remained independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions In this South Asian cohort with sepsis or septic shock, combined strain-based echocardiography and biomarker profiling revealed distinct patterns of myocardial dysfunction associated with early mortality. While these findings highlight the prognostic utility of GLS and NT-proBNP, they should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Larger multicenter studies with extended follow-up and incorporation of additional biomarkers and advanced imaging are needed to validate these observations and clarify underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."
41030561,Development and external validation of a nomogram for predicting one-year survival in patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a critical cerebrovascular emergency characterized by acute bleeding into the subarachnoid space, is associated with permanent neurological deficits, substantial mortality rates, and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Survivors frequently develop long-term complications including cognitive impairment, memory loss, and neuropsychiatric issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, significantly reducing quality of life. Despite advancements in acute-phase management, the long-term survival prognosis for non-traumatic SAH patients remains poorly characterized in current clinical research. Identifying reliable prognostic biomarkers and developing validated predictive models are crucial for enabling risk-stratified care and personalized treatments, improving evidence-based clinical practice. METHOD: This study analyzed baseline and clinical data from 825 non-traumatic SAH patients in the MIMIC-IV ICU database. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression identified independent survival risk factors, followed by nomogram model construction. The model's performance was evaluated using C-index, ROC curve (AUC), calibration curve, and DCA to assess discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. External validation was performed using 290 non-traumatic SAH patients from Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital. RESULT: Multivariate Cox regression identified 11 independent risk factors for non-traumatic SAH survival: hospital stay length, age, respiratory rate, red blood cell count, platelets, potassium, sodium, anion gap, urea nitrogen, blood glucose, and sepsis. A nomogram model based on these factors showed strong discrimination, stratifying patients into risk categories. In the training cohort, the model achieved an AUC of 0.844 (95% CI: 0.815-0.872) and a C-index of 0.827 (95% CI: 0.803-0.851). In the external validation set, the model exhibited acceptable discriminatory performance, with an AUC of 0.807 (95% CI: 0.758-0.856) and a C-index of 0.851 (95% CI: 0.825-0.875). CONCLUSION: In this study, the survival prognosis of patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was found to be associated with eleven factors: length of hospital stay, patient age, respiratory rate, red blood cell count, platelet count, potassium levels, sodium levels, anion gap, urea nitrogen, blood glucose levels, and the presence of sepsis. The nomogram model we developed demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and can serve as a valuable tool for clinicians in rapidly identifying high-risk patients, facilitating personalized risk assessment, and guiding targeted medical interventions."
41029442,Prognostic value of albumin-corrected anion gap in severe chronic kidney disease with sepsis: association with mortality and clinical outcomes.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) has emerged as a prognostic biomarker for critically ill patients. The mortality risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated by sepsis is markedly increased Due to immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. This study sought to investigate the associations between ACAG levels and mortality outcomes, including ICU, in-hospital, 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day mortality, in critically ill patients with CKD and sepsis. METHODS: A total of 3459 critically ill patients with CKD and sepsis who were admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center were included in the analysis. These patients were categorized into two groups-lower and higher ACAG-based on the determined optimal threshold. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the associations between ACAG and ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, as well as 14-, 28-, and 90-day mortality. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive ability, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of ACAG for short-term and long-term mortality after admission in this specific patient population. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to explore the potential dose-response relationship between ACAG and these mortality outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess how patient characteristics affect the prognostic value of ACAG. RESULTS: Compared with the lower ACAG group (n = 2482), the higher ACAG group (n = 977) exhibited significantly higher ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 14-, 28-, and 90-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated ACAG levels were independently Linked to a higher risk of ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, as well as 14-, 28-, and 90-day mortality rates. RCS analysis identified significant Linear relationships between ACAG levels and the risk of ICU death, in-hospital mortality, as well as mortality at 14, 28, and 90 days. ROC curve analysis indicated that ACAG had superior predictive ability for prognosis in this patient population compared to anion gap. The results of the subgroup analyses indicated that there were no statistically significant interactions between ACAG and most specific patient subgroup. CONCLUSION: ACAG serves as an independent prognostic marker for critically ill patients suffering from CKD and sepsis. As an easily accessible and cost-effective biomarker, ACAG can aid in the early identification of high-risk patients, optimize patient management, and improve patient outcomes."
41029220,The added value of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in pregnant women with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with or without preeclampsia on adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal morbidities: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The sFlt-1/PlGF (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor) ratio in serum of pregnant women is a predictive marker for preeclampsia (PE). PE is often associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Overall, growth-restricted fetuses are at increased risk for neonatal morbidities and perinatal death. An increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratio may be valuable for discriminating between different causes of IUGR. The goal of this study is to investigate the added value of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in pregnant women with IUGR on adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal morbidities and mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective, monocenter, observational study conducted at the University Hospital of Antwerp. All singleton pregnancies with IUGR and known serum levels of sFlt-1/PlGF with a gestational age of 24 weeks until 37 weeks were included. The results were analyzed over a period of almost three years (January 2022 until October 2024). In total, 85 patients met the inclusion criteria, ten of whom had not raised serum levels of sFlt-1/PlGF (values less than 85), whereas the other 75 patients had increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratios. The maternal characteristics, fetal and neonatal mortality rates, adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal morbidities of all the patients and their neonates were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In IUGR fetuses with increased maternal serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratios, aberrant ultrasonic fetal doppler, fetal demise and obstetrical diseases such as PE are more often observed. In the group of neonates from mothers with a raised sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, more neonatal morbidities, such as respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, early-onset sepsis, late-onset sepsis and retinopathy of prematurity, are observed. Nevertheless, it is important to correct those results for GA and birth weight since morbidities are more often observed in more premature neonates. CONCLUSION: In patients with IUGR due to placental insufficiency, an increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratio is observed. Only in the group with an increased sFlt-1/PlGF ratio did intrauterine fetal death occur. During pregnancy, more obstetrical diseases and a greater need for medication were observed. Neonatal outcomes always need to be corrected for GA and birth weight, but therefore, the inclusion number was too low."
41029153,The significance of lactate-to-serum albumin ratio in pediatric sepsis.,2025,"This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the lactate-to-albumin ratio (L/A ratio) for sepsis in children at admission. This retrospective study involved all children with sepsis admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit from January 2021 to January 2024. Clinical data of included patients were collected through our hospital's databases. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality and Pediatric Index of Mortality II scores were calculated, and lactate, albumin, and L/A ratio were measured within 24 hours of admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the independent association of the L/A ratio and the risk of sepsis on the day of admission. This study included 100 children (50 with sepsis, 50 non-sepsis). The sepsis group had a higher level of lactate and L/A ratio.The serum albumin was considerably lower compared with the non-sepsis group. Logistic regression analysis suggested that the lactate, serum albumin, L/A ratio, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, and Pediatric Index of Mortality II score are independent risk factors for sepsis. Moreover, the area under the curve of the lactate, serum albumin, and L/A ratio is 0.76, 0.69, and 0.85, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of the L/A ratio as a robust marker for evaluating children with sepsis."
41028542,A consensus blood transcriptomic framework for sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition driven by a maladaptive host response to infection. To establish a standardized blood transcriptomic subtype model, we aggregated blood transcriptomics data from two major sepsis cohorts: the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) project (n = 678 sampled on intensive care unit admission; ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT01905033 ) and the Genomic Advances in Sepsis (GAinS) study (n = 444 sampled on intensive care unit admission and n = 817 follow-up samples; ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT00131196 ). We demonstrate a strong interconnection across three separate classification methods, resulting in the proposed groupings of three consensus transcriptomic subtypes (CTSs). The distinguishing characteristics of CTS1 included gene activation of typical inflammatory pathways, more pronounced endothelial activation and an overall immature neutrophil theme. CTS2 was characterized by gene activation of a heme metabolism pathway, fibrinolytic disturbances and platelet and eosinophil signatures. CTS3 was associated with genes involved in the activation of allograft rejection, interferon signaling and anticoagulation functions, together with lymphocyte and nonclassical monocyte features. Evaluating CTS classification in independent patient cohorts, specifically the vasopressin vs noradrenaline as initial therapy in septic shock (VANISH) randomized controlled trial (n = 176; ISRCTN registration no. ISRCTN20769191 ) and patients hospitalized with suspected sepsis at a district hospital in Uganda (n = 128), ascertained the robustness of our approach. Notably, post hoc analysis of a pseudo-randomized cohort, along with a reanalysis of the VANISH trial data, unmasked a harmful signal in CTS2-assigned patients treated with corticosteroids. The CTS classification method aligns diverse sepsis transcriptomic subgroupings into a robust, reproducible framework, thereby enabling biological interpretation and potentially assisting aspects of clinical trial design to advance precision medicine in sepsis."
41028541,Clinical validation of an AI-based blood testing device for diagnosis and prognosis of acute infection and sepsis.,2025,"Lack of reliable diagnostics for the presence, type and severity of infection in patients presenting to emergency departments with non-specific symptoms poses considerable challenges. We developed TriVerity, which uses isothermal amplification of 29 mRNAs and machine learning algorithms on the Myrna instrument to determine likelihoods of bacterial infection, viral infection and need for critical care interventions within 7 days. To validate TriVerity, the SEPSIS-SHIELD study enrolled 1,222 patients with clinically adjudicated infection status and need for critical care intervention within 7 days as endpoints. The TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores had higher accuracy than C-reactive protein, procalcitonin or white blood cell count for the diagnosis of bacterial infection with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.83, and viral infection (AUROC = 0.91). The TriVerity Severity score had an AUROC of 0.78 for predicting illness severity and allowed reclassification of risk for critical care interventions compared to clinical assessment (quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) alone. Each of the three scores had rule-in specificity >92% and rule-out sensitivity >95%. Comparison of antibiotics administration at presentation with post-follow-up adjudication found that TriVerity could potentially reduce false positives and false negatives for inappropriate antibiotics use by 60-70%. Further clinical testing in an interventional setting is needed to prove actionability and clinical benefit of TriVerity."
41027784,Integrating Multi-Modal Imaging Features for Early Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in Pneumonia Sepsis: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,2025,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis, a severe complication of infection, often leads to acute kidney injury (AKI), which significantly increases the risk of death. Despite its clinical importance, early prediction of AKI remains challenging. Current tools rely on blood and urine tests, which are costly, variable, and not always available in time for intervention. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis, accounting for over one-third of cases. In such patients, pulmonary inflammation and perilesional tissue alterations may serve as surrogate markers of systemic disease progression. However, these imaging features are rarely used in clinical decision-making. To overcome this limitation, our study aims to extract informative imaging features from pneumonia-associated sepsis cases using deep learning, with the goal of predicting the development of AKI. METHODS: This dual-center retrospective study included pneumonia-associated sepsis patients (Jan 2020-Jul 2024). Chest CT images, clinical records, and laboratory data at admission were collected. We propose MCANet (Multimodal Cross-Attention Network), a two-stage deep learning framework designed to predict the occurrence of pneumonia-associated sepsis-related acute kidney injury (pSA-AKI). In the first stage, region-specific features were extracted from the lungs, epicardial adipose tissue, and T4-level subcutaneous adipose tissue using ResNet-18, which was chosen for its lightweight architecture and efficiency in processing multi-regional 2D CT slices with low computational cost. In the second stage, the extracted features were fused via a Multiscale Feature Attention Network (MSFAN) employing cross-attention mechanisms to enhance interactions among anatomical regions, followed by classification using ResNet-101, selected for its deeper architecture and strong ability to model global semantic representations and complex patterns.Model performance was evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Grad-CAM and PyRadiomics were employed for visual interpretation and radiomic analysis, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 399 patients with pneumonia-associated sepsis were included in this study. The modality ablation experiments demonstrated that the model integrating features from the lungs, T4-level subcutaneous adipose tissue, and epicardial adipose tissue achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.981 and an AUC of 0.99 on the external test set from an independent center. For the prediction of AKI onset time, the LightGBM model incorporating imaging and clinical features achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8409 on the external test set. Furthermore, the multimodal model combining deep features, radiomics features, and clinical data further improved predictive performance, reaching an accuracy of 0.9773 and an AUC of 0.961 on the external test set. CONCLUSION: This study developed MCAnet, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates imaging features from the lungs, epicardial adipose tissue, and T4-level subcutaneous adipose tissue. The framework significantly improved the accuracy of AKI occurrence and temporal prediction in pneumonia-associated sepsis patients, highlighting the synergistic role of adipose tissue and lung characteristics. Furthermore, explainability analysis revealed potential decision-making mechanisms underlying the temporal progression of pSA-AKI, offering new insights for clinical management."
41027636,Sepsis Identification Tools: A Narrative Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Although sepsis remains a medical emergency, there is no standard test for diagnosing it. Current sepsis management guidelines strongly recommend screening for sepsis but do not identify a specific tool to use. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence for sepsis screening tools and triggers, identify the current tools used, and describe their effectiveness. METHODS: A review of the literature from January 2019 through June 2024 was performed. Studies were included if they described sepsis screening tools used for adults in the emergency department or adult inpatients, including intensive care unit patients. Studies were excluded if they described tools specific to machine learning with artificial intelligence or biomarkers and biologics. RESULTS: A total of 300 articles were screened. The final set of 26 studies included articles on computerized clinical decision support systems (8 studies), existing early warning systems (14 studies), and new or novel tools (4 studies). Sepsis definitions were heterogeneous and generally based on disease classification codes, criteria from the Sepsis-2 or Sepsis-3 definitions, or combinations thereof. The most commonly used early warning system tools used that had superior evidence were the National Early Warning Score versions 1 and 2. Little evidence supported the use of the quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment alone for sepsis identification. The use of computerized clinical decision support systems is varied; both proprietary and individual system-developed tools are available, with little consensus on standards for reporting accuracy. CONCLUSION: It is clear that all currently available tools function only as adjuncts to clinical acumen."
41027321,Early sepsis prediction in the emergency department using machine learning.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Early recognition of sepsis is critical for timely intervention. Early intervention (eg. with antibiotics) can reduce the risk on organ injury and eventually death. Commonly used clinical scores, such as qSOFA and NEWS, have limited predictive performance to predict organ failure and mortality in patients with early sepsis. Moreover, they require to be estimated by a human operator and lack the capacity to use diverse input sources. Machine learning (ML) models may improve risk stratification by integrating a broader range of parameters. METHODS: This study is a post-hoc analysis of prospectively collected data from 1431 patients presenting to the ED with suspected sepsis. A total of 149 clinical parameters, which were routinely collected as part of clinical care during ED stay, were extracted from electronic health records and bedside measurements. Machine learning (ML) models were developed in 10-fold cross validation to predict organ injury and 30-day mortality. Model performance was validated afterwards and compared to qSOFA and NEWS. RESULTS: The ML models achieved an AUROC (area under the receiver operator curve) of 0.798, 95 % CI [0.775, 0.821] for organ injury and 00.808, 95 % CI [0.777, 0.839] for 30-day mortality, outperforming qSOFA (AUROC 0.557-0.577) and NEWS (AUROC 0.576-0.610). Serum creatinine, SOFA score, ISAR-HP score, and clinical impression contributed to most to the model's score. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models using routinely available ED data were associated with improved predictive performance of organ injury and 30-day mortality in early sepsis compared to conventional scoring systems, highlighting their potential for clinical decision support."
41027023,"Prediction of Moderate-to-Severe Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Using a Dual-Timepoint Machine Learning Model: Development, Multiregional Validation, and Clinical Deployment Study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a frequent and life-threatening complication in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), significantly increasing both mortality rates and the risk of chronic kidney dysfunction. However, existing prediction models have often focused on overall risk and lack severity-based stratification, which limits their clinical applicability. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify critical time points in SA-AKI progression development and validate dynamic, stratified machine learning prediction models for moderate-to-severe (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline stages 2-3) SA-AKI through multicenter, multiregional external validation, ultimately deploying them as publicly accessible, interpretable clinical decision support tools. METHODS: This study used three independent ICU databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v3.0 (n=12,842; model development and internal validation), electronic ICU collaborative research database v2.0 (n=15,767; North American multicenter external validation), and the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University ICU (n=210; Chinese single-center external validation). We identified 48 hours (acute phase) and 7 days (subacute phase) as critical time points. Based on clinical data from the first 24 hours of ICU admission, we used a two-stage feature selection process combining light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) cross-validation analysis with clinical expert review, followed by modeling using 8 machine learning algorithms. The optimal model was selected based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Internal validation used 5-fold cross-validation, while external validation and subgroup analyses assessed generalizability across different regions and populations. SHAP values and partial dependence plots were used to interpret the influence of key features on predictions. RESULTS: Our dual-timepoint LightGBM model demonstrated robust predictive performance. For the 48-hour prediction task, the model achieved an AUC of 0.839 (95% CI 0.824-0.854) in the internal test set, with AUCs of 0.770 (95% CI 0.762-0.779) and 0.793 (95% CI 0.726-0.856) in the external validation cohorts, respectively. For the 7-day prediction task, the corresponding AUCs across the three cohorts were 0.834 (95% CI 0.818-0.850), 0.720 (95% CI 0.711-0.729), and 0.773 (95% CI 0.687-0.851), respectively. Subgroup analyses confirmed robust model performance across different age, gender, and comorbidity subgroups. SHAP analysis identified urine output, mechanical ventilation, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and nephrotoxic drug use as core predictive features. Decision curve analysis confirmed that LightGBM provided consistent clinical benefit across different threshold ranges. The optimal LightGBM model was deployed as a publicly accessible web-based prediction app with integrated SHAP interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and validated a dynamic, stratified prediction system that provides stage-specific risk assessment for moderate-to-severe SA-AKI. The system underwent rigorous multiregional, multicenter validation and was translated into an interpretable clinical decision support tool, providing a scientific foundation for precision management."
41026286,Development and validation of a machine learning model for early prediction of intensive care unit acquired weakness.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of potential high cost and high need patients on the ICU may assist in the development of targeted protocols, which allows proper resource utilization and initialization of preventive care. Weakness acquired in the ICU developed within the first week is an independent predictor of both short and long-term adverse outcomes, nonetheless early prediction is challenging. We aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model for ICU acquired-weakness (ICU-AW), using data readily available within the first 24 h of ICU admission. METHODS: Patients from the EPaNIC trial (NCT00512122, N = 4640) who were assessed for muscle weakness at day 9 (IQR 8-13), after ICU-admission, using the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum. Patients are diagnosed with ICU-AW if their MRC is higher than 48. The final subset contains N = 600. Our models were internally validated using 100 repetitions of fivefold cross validation. We compared three predictive models: (i) a random forest and (ii) a logistic regression model built using descriptors available at day 1, (iii) a random forest using only APACHE II as a descriptor. Both random forests contain 150 trees. RESULTS: The training set comprised 600 patients where the incidence of ICU-AW was 38.6% (232/600). The AUROC of the random forest with all descriptors and the logistic regression were 76% and 74%, respectively. The random forest (RF) achieved a specificity of 62% and a sensitivity 79%, whereas the logistic regression yielded 69% and 68%, respectively. The RF identified APACHE II, creatinine, SOFA PaO2/FiO2, bilirubin, BMI, age, glycemia upon admission, morning glycemia and sepsis as the most relevant descriptors. Lastly, the RF also presented very good calibration and clinical usefulness for a wide range of risk thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models, especially random forests, can be used to predict if patients are at risk of developing ICU-AW, using data available within 24 h of admission. This tool allows prognostication early in an adult general critically ill patient population, with the potential to detect high cost and high need patients who benefit from different levels of care."
41024368,Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Is a Novel Potential Predictor of 30-Day Mortality in Patients With Necrotizing Fasciitis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality. Early identification of patients at risk for ICU admission and 30-day mortality is critical. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, 88 NF patients were compared with age- and gender-matched erysipelas controls. We studied systemic immune-inflammation biomarkers (e.g., SII, NLR), the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD; calculated from serum bilirubin, creatinine, and INR), kidney markers, and the LRINEC score at presentation. Logistic regression identified ICU admission predictors; Cox regression assessed 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Compared with erysipelas controls, NF patients had higher white-cell counts, liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, and procalcitonin; only MELD differed among composite indices (p < 0.01). Of 88 NF cases, 58 (65.9%) required ICU care and 21 (23.9%) died within 30 days. Univariable analysis linked ICU admission to CRP > 295.3 mg/L, sepsis, trunk involvement, no upper-extremity infection, and higher LRINEC (all p < 0.01). Thirty-day mortality correlated with younger age, dementia, severe liver disease, eosinopenia, and elevated MELD, INR, and creatinine (all p < 0.05). Multivariable models showed CRP > 295.3 mg/L (OR 42.5; 95% CI 4.3-424.4) and sepsis (OR 13.5; 95% CI 3.3-32.8) as independent ICU admission predictors, and MELD score alone predicted 30-day mortality (HR 1.61 per point; 95% CI 1.13-2.30). CONCLUSIONS: High CRP levels confirm their value in predicting ICU admission; however, the most novel finding is the independent prognostic power of MELD for 30-day mortality. Incorporating MELD alongside CRP into clinical pathways could markedly improve early risk stratification."
41024303,Clinical characteristics associated with septic shock complicating hypothermia: a retrospective cohort study from the MIMIC-IV database.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock, a severe consequence of sepsis, has a high mortality rate. Hypothermia can aggravate the state of septic shock patients, which influences therapeutic response and overall prognosis. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism of action associated with septic shock in hypothermia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate clinical factors and develop a predictive model for accurately assessing the risk probability of concomitant hypothermia in septic shock patients. METHODS: This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, which collected data on patients with septic shock from 2008 to 2019. Several covariates were introduced to identify clinical factors related to septic shock patients complicated by hypothermia. The univariate Logistic regression analysis, machine learning, and multivariate Logistic regression analysis identified covariates as significant independent predictors for patients with septic shock complicating hypothermia. Afterwards, a nomogram was constructed on the basis of the identified independent predictors, with predictive performance evaluated via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 1640 participants with septic shock (hypothermia:non-hypothermia = 134:1506) were screened after the exclusion of samples. A notable disparity was observed in several covariates between septic shock patients presenting with concomitant hypothermia and those without hypothermia, such as hemoglobin, bicarbonate, and heart rate. Subsequent analyses revealed that hemoglobin, heart rate, respiratory rate, lactate, and dopamine were associated with prognosis in septic shock complicating hypothermia. Moreover, the constructed nomogram displayed promising potential for effectively evaluating septic shock complicated by hypothermia, which exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.787. CONCLUSIONS: Five clinical factors-hemoglobin, heart rate, respiratory rate, lactate, and dopamine-that were significantly associated with hypothermia in septic shock, suggesting that these factors could serve as potential predictors and provide a reference for clinical risk assessment."
41023805,Evaluation of the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index as a prognostic marker in patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early identification of high-risk patients is essential. The C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index has emerged as a potential prognostic biomarker but has not been widely studied in emergency department (ED) populations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including adult patients diagnosed with sepsis upon ED admission. The CALLY index was calculated as (albumin x lymphocyte count) / C-reactive protein (CRP), using laboratory values obtained at presentation. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Predictive performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variable selection, calibration metrics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. RESULTS: A total of 669 patients were included, with a 30-day mortality rate of 23% (n = 156). Non-survivors had significantly higher CRP (107.30 +/- 40.97 vs. 94.01 +/- 28.09 mg/L, p = 0.002), lower albumin (2.81 +/- 0.30 vs. 3.59 +/- 0.22 g/dL, p < 0.001), and lower lymphocyte count (0.71 +/- 0.31 vs. 1.30 +/- 0.40 x 10(9)/L, p < 0.001). The mean CALLY index was markedly elevated in deceased patients (69.7 +/- 54.2 vs. 23.1 +/- 15.6, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC of the CALLY index was 0.906 (95% CI, 0.879-0.934). At the threshold yielding the maximum Youden Index (31.32), the sensitivity was 0.853, specificity was 0.854, and accuracy was 0.852. CONCLUSION: The CALLY index is a simple and accessible biomarker independently associated with 30-day mortality in ED patients with sepsis and may support early risk stratification in acute care. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41023323,Circulating biomarkers of vasoplegia: a systematic review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vasoplegia is characterised by persistent hypotension and reduced systemic vascular resistance despite preserved cardiac output, commonly arising in sepsis, following major surgery, and within systemic inflammatory responses. Despite its clinical significance and association with poor outcomes, there is no universally accepted definition or standardised biomarker, impeding early diagnosis, stratification, and targeted therapy. While individual studies have examined biomarkers within specific clinical contexts such as septic shock or cardiac surgery, no comprehensive synthesis across all aetiologies of vasoplegia has previously been undertaken. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate and synthesise the current evidence regarding circulating biomarkers associated with the incidence, severity, prediction, and progression of vasoplegia across diverse critical care and perioperative populations. As well as review definitions used across literature. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024438786). Studies were included if they investigated adult patients in critical care or perioperative settings with vasoplegia defined by reduced vascular resistance and hypotension requiring vasopressors. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies met inclusion criteria. The included studies examined 39 unique biomarkers, with renin and adrenomedullin being the most frequently studied. Heterogeneity in definitions of vasoplegia, outcome measures, and comparator populations precluded meta-analysis. However, several biomarkers demonstrated potential clinical utility: elevated renin levels correlated with vasopressor requirements and haemodynamic instability, while adrenomedullin levels were predictive of vasoplegia development and duration. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of standardisation in biomarker assay methods and vasoplegia definitions remains a significant barrier to comparative analysis. Whilst this review highlights renin and adrenomedullin as promising candidate biomarkers for vasoplegia, the heterogeneity in study design, biomarker measurement, and diagnostic criteria underscores the urgent need for a consensus definition of vasoplegia, standardised sampling protocols, and unified outcome measures. Future research should focus on biomarker-guided risk stratification and personalised therapies, with an emphasis on validating predictive and mechanistic roles across diverse vasoplegic phenotypes."
41023284,Dexmedetomidine regulates the SIRT3-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway to protect against sepsis-induced intestinal injury.,2025,"Sepsis is a clinical syndrome triggered by a dysregulated host response to pathogens that leads to multiple organ dysfunction. Intestinal barrier function plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis. The present study investigated the potential therapeutic role of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in sepsis-induced intestinal injury and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study included a cohort of 57 patients with sepsis treated with or without DEX. A mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged intestinal epithelial cells was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DEX against sepsis-associated intestinal injury. Serum levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and the intestinal injury biomarker I-FABP were significantly lower in the DEX-treated group (n = 30) compared to the non-DEX group (n = 27) in sepsis patients (P < 0.05). DEX improved survival rates, attenuated intestinal inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-6), inhibited epithelial apoptosis, and alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal barrier damage (ZO-1 and claudin-1) in CLP mice. In vitro, treatment with DEX protected against LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) reduction in Caco-2 cells. Mechanistically, DEX upregulated SIRT3 levels, thereby reducing the expression of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3, inhibiting intestinal epithelial apoptosis and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1). Furthermore, the regulatory effects of DEX on intestinal damage disappeared when the SIRT3 antagonist, 3-TYP, was added. SIRT3 knockdown partially abrogated the protective effects of DEX against LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and TEER reduction. These findings provide novel insights into the protective role of DEX against sepsis-induced intestinal injury, at least partially by regulating inhibition of SIRT3/JAK2/STAT3-mediated apoptosis, supporting DEX as a promising therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of sepsis-related intestinal damage."
41023055,Integrated multi omics and machine learning reveal mitochondrial immunometabolic networks in sepsis associated encephalopathy.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a major complication in intensive care units, characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction due to systemic inflammation. Despite advances in critical care medicine, SAE remains a key factor in poor patient outcomes, with its pathogenesis closely related to mitochondrial damage and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In this study, we integrated multiple transcriptomic and single-cell sequencing datasets to comprehensively analyze mitochondrial-associated differentially expressed genes (MitoDEGs) in SAE brain tissues. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified three core biomarkers (ALDH7A1, HOGA1, and AA467197). Functional enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in SAE were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while the downregulated genes were associated with mitochondrial metabolism and vascular functions. Based on MitoDEGs, clinical subtype analysis shows that changes in mitochondrial function can effectively distinguish three sepsis subtypes (Cluster 1-3). Among these, Cluster 3 had worse prognosis due to enhanced mitochondrial function and activated inflammatory pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed that MitoDEGs were closely associated with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) signaling and the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Experimental validation showed that exogenous mtDNA significantly increased the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6), thereby aggravating brain tissue pathological damage."
41022643,Predicting risk of early-onset sepsis in low-resource neonatal units using routine healthcare data: development and evaluation of multivariable statistical and machine learning models.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings and accurate, context-appropriate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: We used data collected using Neotree, an open source digital health intervention tool, from neonates admitted to Sally Mugabe Central Hospital in Harare between February 2021 and September 2024 to model a composite outcome variable comprised of senior clinician-assigned diagnosis at discharge or cause of death and blood culture test results. Three statistical and machine learning algorithms were developed, tuned where appropriate using cross-validation and evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 917 cases of early-onset neonatal sepsis were identified among the 18 345 neonates in our study sample, comprising 664 cases of clinician diagnosis and 253 positive blood culture results. With area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as a metric, LightGBM, a machine learning gradient-boosted tree classifier, performed marginally better (0.712; 95% CI 0.673 to 0.75) than logistic regression (0.687; 95% CI 0.646 to 0.728) on a held-out evaluation dataset. A simple and easily interpretable machine learning model, the k-neighbours classifier, offered comparable performance (0.699; 95% CI 0.662 to 0.736). CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the potential advantages of using machine learning in the triage of neonates at risk of sepsis in low-resource settings where gold-standard blood culture test results are often unavailable. While the differences in performance metrics were not statistically significant, the machine learning approaches in our study offer other advantages including more intuitive predictions and the ability to handle missing data without imputation."
41020894,Protective Effect of Hepcidin on Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury via Activating the Nrf2/GPX4 Signaling Pathway.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Hepcidin not only sustains systemic iron homeostasis but also functions as an antimicrobial peptide. During this study, we sought to analyze the ability of hepcidin to protect against sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI) and elucidated its underlying mechanisms in mediating ferroptotic pathways. METHODS: A SAKI mouse model was created via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), along with an LPS-induced Human Kidney-2 (HK-2) cell model, to study the protective mechanism of hepcidin against SAKI. Through the analysis of renal injury biomarkers and ferroptosis-related molecules, combined with quantitative detection of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a regulatory protein of ferroptosis, we uncovered the hepcidin-mediated mechanisms underlying ferroptosis in SAKI. RESULTS: Hepcidin significantly attenuated renal function impairment in mice with SAKI and reduced the sepsis-driven increase in inflammatory mediators. As sepsis was associated with enhanced renal ferroptosis, hepcidin exerted a therapeutic effect by mitigating ferroptosis to a degree comparable with that of the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Furthermore, hepcidin conferred renoprotective effects in SAKI by promoting the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which in turn mediated the upregulation of the downstream anti-ferroptotic protein GPX4. Importantly, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 abrogated both the hepcidin-induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the subsequent increase in GPX4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Protective effects of hepcidin against SAKI are mediated by the Nrf2/GPX4 ferroptosis pathway, underscoring its therapeutic potential for SAKI."
41020143,Evaluation of Serum Ischemia-Modified Albumin And Oxidative Stress Markers in Patients with Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: The most common causes of mortality and morbidity in patients followed up in intensive care are bacterial infections and sepsis. Rapid and timely intervention is essential for the successful treatment of sepsis. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the relationships between mortality and patients by examining ischemia-modified albumin, APACHE II, CRP, PCT, lactate, WBC, NLR, PLR, SII, platelet, and lactate/IMA (LIMA) values in patients with sepsis followed up in intensive care units. MATERIAL METHOD: The study was planned as prospective and single-center. 31 patients diagnosed with sepsis were included in the study. The first 24 hours and 5th day values of patients diagnosed with sepsis were examined and recorded. The biomarkers and APACHE-II score of patients diagnosed with sepsis were examined for predictive power of 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with sepsis from the Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit were included in the study. Of the total patients, 21 (67.7%) were male and 10 (32.3%) were female. The APACHE-II score of patients diagnosed with sepsis in the first 24 hours (AUC:0.891, 95% CI: 77.6-100, p<0.0001) was determined to be the best indicator for predicting 28-day mortality. In addition, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio on day 5 (AUC:0.765, 95% CI:59.3-93.7, p:0.013), Lactate/IMA on day 1 (AUC:0.628, 95% CI:59.3-83.9, p:0.230) and SII on day 5 (AUC:0.624, 95% CI:42.3-82.5, p:0.246) were also determined as other biomarkers that can be used to predict 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: APACHE-II score still maintains its place in predicting mortality in patients with sepsis. No biomarker alone has been able to surpass this score, and markers obtained in combination such as NLR, LIMA and SII may be helpful in predicting mortality. New and large-scale studies are needed on this subject."
41018513,Maternal perinatal risk factors and full-term neonatal early-onset sepsis: A novel prediction model based on machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), occurring within 72 h of birth, is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The urgent need for rapid, accurate diagnosis is underscored by the condition's severity. Current diagnostic methods are hampered by non-specific clinical signs, leading to underdiagnosis or overtreatment. This highlights a crucial gap in neonatal care. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from 1613 full-term pregnant women at a single center in Shenzhen, China (2022), including 69 EOS cases. Ten machine learning algorithms (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) were developed using maternal prenatal predictors. Data preprocessing involved imputation, standardization, and Lasso feature selection. Models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, and the SMOTE technique was applied to address class imbalance. RESULTS: Among ten machine learning models, XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrated the highest discriminative ability (AUC=0.87). While a default threshold yielded low sensitivity, a threshold optimized for a clinical screening objective (0.04) achieved a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 73.1%. Key predictors identified included maternal temperature and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that machine learning models based on maternal factors have the potential to serve as high-sensitivity screening tools for EOS. Tuning the decision threshold is a critical step to maximize clinical utility, which involves a necessary trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. This approach provides a framework for developing and evaluating clinically-oriented prediction models to improve neonatal care."
41017528,Flow cytometry-based evaluation of CD4/CD25 and IL-17 expression in sepsis of cancer surgical patients.,2025,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a critical, life-threatening condition marked by organ dysfunction. Patients undergoing surgery for cancer are especially susceptible, facing a significantly increased risk compared to the general population. Prompt diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment outcomes. This study investigates the expression levels of IL-17 and CD4/CD25 in postoperative surgical oncology patients diagnosed with sepsis and examines their association with various clinicopathological parameters, including mortality. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected 48 h following admission to the surgical ICU. Flow cytometry was employed to measure the expression of IL-17 and CD4/CD25 in both septic patients and non-septic controls. RESULTS: The study included 30 septic patients and an equal number of controls. The expression of IL-17 and CD4/CD25 was significantly higher in septic patients compared to non-septic patients, demonstrating high diagnostic performance. Additionally, elevated IL-17 expression was strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight into immune dysregulation in postoperative cancer patients with sepsis, highlighting the dual arms of active inflammation and immunoparalysis. Elevated IL-17 levels, coupled with Treg activation, were linked to poorer outcomes. Therapeutic strategies that target IL-17 signaling and modulate Treg activity may help restore immune balance and improve prognosis in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, developing predictive models using machine learning to classify sepsis severity based on immune markers could enhance diagnosis and prognosis."
41017209,The Prognostic Value of LncRNA NNT-AS1 in CRRT-Treated Patients and Its Regulatory Mechanism in Acute Kidney Injury.,2025,"AIM: We investigated the prognostic value of lncRNA NNT-AS1 in patients undergoing CRRT and its regulatory mechanism in acute kidney injury. METHODS: First, we detected serum levels of NNT-AS1 by RT-qPCR in patients before and after treatment with CRRT. Next, the survival probability between NNT-AS1 levels and prognosis of CRRT-treated patients was explored with Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve analysis. The potential risk factors were evaluated via Cox regression analysis. Moreover, LPS-induced HK-2 cells were employed to establish an in vitro cellular experimental model. Cell viability and apoptosis rate were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry. The relative mRNA levels of MDA and ROS were detected via RT-qPCR, and the concentration of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins-1beta (IL-1beta), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) was detected by ELISA assay. Finally, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was utilised to verify the targeted binding of NNT-AS1 to miR-582-5p. RESULTS: Serum NNT-AS1 levels were significantly reduced following CRRT, and patients with high levels of NNT-AS1 had lower survival probability. NNT-AS1 is a potential risk factor for poor outcomes in patients treated with CRRT. In LPS-induced HK-2 cells, NNT-AS1 knockdown increased cell viability and reduced the apoptosis rate. Also, NNT-AS1 knockdown suppressed the expression of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory factors and markers of renal tubular injury. NNT-AS1 targeted miR-582-5p by dual-luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSION: LncRNA NNT-AS1 can serve as a marker of poor prognosis for CRRT treatment as well as participate in AKI by targeting miR-582-5p."
41017178,[Early warning method for invasive mechanical ventilation in septic patients based on machine learning model].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for identifying high-risk patients among septic populations requiring mechanical ventilation, and to conduct phenotypic analysis based on this method. METHODS: Data from four sources were utilized: the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV 2.0, MIMIC-III 1.4), the Philips eICU-Collaborative Research Database 2.0 (eICU-CRD 2.0), and the Anhui Medical University Second Affiliated Hospital dataset. The adult patients in intensive care unit (ICU) who met Sepsis-3 and received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) on the first day of first admission were enrolled. The MIMIC-IV dataset with the highest data integrity was divided into a training set and a test set at a 6:1 ratio, while the remaining datasets were served as validation sets. The demographic information, comorbidities, laboratory indicators, commonly used ICU scores, and treatment measures of patients were extracted. Clinical data collected within first day of ICU admission were used to calculate the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. K-means clustering was applied to cluster SOFA score components, and the sum of squared errors (SSE) and Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) were used to determine the optimal number of disease subtypes. For clustering results, normalized methods were employed to compare baseline characteristics by visualization, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze clinical outcomes across phenotypes. RESULTS: This study enrolled patients from MIMIC-IV dataset (n = 11 166), MIMIC-III dataset (n = 4 821), eICU-CRD dataset (n = 6 624), and a local dataset (n = 110), with the four datasets showing similar median ages and male proportions exceeding 50%; using 85% of the MIMIC-IV dataset as the training set, 15% as the test set, and the rest dataset as the validation set. K-means clustering based on the six-item SOFA score was performed to determine the optimal number of clusters as 3, and patients were finally classified into three phenotypes. In the training set, compared with the patients with phenotype II and phenotype III, those with phenotype I had the more severe circulatory and respiratory dysfunction, a higher proportion of vasoactive drug usage, more obvious metabolic acidosis and hypoxia, and a higher incidence of congestive heart failure. The patients with phenotype II was dominated by respiratory dysfunction with higher visceral injury. The patients with phenotype III had relatively stable organ function. The above characteristics were consistent in both the test and validation sets. Analysis of infection-related indicators showed that the patients with phenotype I had the highest SOFA score within 7 days after ICU admission, initial decreases and later increases in platelet count (PLT), and higher counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes as compared with those with phenotype II and phenotype III, their blood cultures had a higher positivity rates for Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi as compared with those with phenotype II and phenotype III. The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that in the training, test, and validation sets, the 28-day cumulative mortality of patients with phenotype I was significantly higher than that of patients with phenotypes II and phenotype III. CONCLUSIONS: Three distinct phenotypes in septic patients receiving IMV based on unsupervised machine learning is derived, among which phenotype I, characterized by cardiorespiratory failure, can be used for the early identification of high-risk patients in this population. Moreover, this population is more prone to bloodstream infections, posing a high risk and having a poor prognosis."
41016230,T cell-mediated clearance of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from the lung characterized by machine learning analysis in vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs.,2025,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) modified live virus (MLV) vaccines likely confer partial protection against heterologous wild type challenge through broadly reactive T cells. Therefore, the efficacy of Ingelvac PRRS(R) MLV alone and reconstituted with Ingelvac CircoFLEX(R) was assessed by comparing the ability to induce a robust cell-mediated immune response and confer protection against challenge. This study utilized both classic immune assays and machine learning software for measuring the cell-mediated immune response to PRRSV vaccination and challenge. Both vaccine groups had significantly reduced viremia, lung viral load, gross and microscopic lung lesions and improved average daily gain compared to the mock vaccinated group. The T cell analysis in the lung revealed a robust response to PRRSV infection leading to marked clearance of virus from the lung in the absence of neutralizing antibodies."
41015561,[Nomogram and machine learning models for predicting in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients with deep vein thrombosis].,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Global epidemiological data indicate that 20% to 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) sepsis patients progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to coagulopathy, with an associated mortality rate of 25% to 40%. Existing prognostic tools have limitations. This study aims to develop and validate nomogram and machine learning models to predict in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients with DVT and assess their clinical applicability. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study drew on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV; n=2 235), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD; n=1 274), and the Patient Admission Dataset from the ICU of Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (CSU-XYS-ICU; n=107). MIMIC-IV was split into a training set (n=1 584) and internal validation set (n=651), with the remaining datasets used for external validation. Predictors were selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and a nomogram model was constructed. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to build the machine learning model. Model performance was assessed by the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, Brier score, decision curve analysis (DCA), and net reclassification improvement index (NRI). RESULTS: Five key predictors, age [odds ratio (OR)=1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03, P<0.001], minimum activated partial thromboplastin (APTT; OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.11, P<0.001), maximum APTT (OR=1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01, P<0.001), maximum lactate (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.75, P<0.001), and maximum serum creatinine (OR=2.03, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.30, P<0.001), were included in the nomogram. The model showed robust performance in internal validation (C-index=0.845, 95% CI 0.811 to 0.879) and external validation (eICU-CRD: C-index=0.827, 95% CI 0.800 to 0.854; CSU-XYS-ICU: C-index=0.779, 95% CI 0.687 to 0.871). Calibration curves indicated good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes (Brier score<0.25), and DCA confirmed clinical benefit. The XGBoost model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.982 (95% CI 0.969 to 0.985) in the training set, but performance declined in external validation (eICU-CRD, AUC=0.825, 95% CI 0.817 to 0.861; CSU-XYS-ICU, AUC=0.766, 95% CI 0.700 to 0.873), though it remained above clinical thresholds. Net reclassification improvement was slightly lower for XGBoost compared with the nomogram (NRI=0.58). CONCLUSIONS: Both the nomogram and XGBoost models effectively predict in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients with DVT. However, the nomogram offers superior generalizability and clinical usability. Its visual scoring system provides a quantitative tool for identifying high-risk patients and implementing individualized interventions."
41013727,Integrated bioinformatics analysis unravels mitochondrial-immune crosstalk and infiltration dynamics in sepsis progression.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical illness, and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with its progression. However, the classification of mitochondrial-related differentially expressed genes (MitoDEGs) in sepsis and the immune infiltration characteristics have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore the relevant content. METHODS: Gene expression data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), while mitochondrial-related genes were sourced from the MitoCarta3.0 database. We applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify Sepsis-related MitoDEGs (Se-MitoDEGs), and utilized unsupervised clustering analysis to categorize sepsis samples into distinct clusters. Machine learning algorithms identified hub Se-MitoDEGs, and a validation set and a nomogram for sepsis diagnosis were established. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to investigate immune infiltration characteristics in sepsis and their association with hub Se-MitoDEGs. The expression levels of relevant genes were evaluated in peripheral blood samples from septic patients and normal controls through quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Associated transcription factors, miRNAs, and drugs were constructed into a diagram via NetworkAnalyst and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). RESULTS: 15 Se-MitoDEGs exhibited differential expression between septic and normal samples. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated significant increases in neutrophils, activated mast cells, and M0 macrophages among septic patients compared to control subjects. We categorized sepsis samples into two clusters; most hub genes in cluster 2 (C2) were highly expressed, exhibiting low immune infiltration and immune score. Some differences were observed in the pathways between the two clusters. By utilizing machine learning techniques and the validation set, MSRB2, TSPO, and BLOC1S1 were identified, and a nomogram of the three genes exhibited a substantial area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886, and the AUC for the validation set was recorded at 0.866, highlighting the robustness of our predictive model. Survival analysis found that low expression of TSPO and high expression of MSRB2 in peripheral blood were negatively correlated with the 28-day survival rate of septic patients. qRT-PCR validation indicated that the expression levels of these three hub genes are consistent with our bioinformatics analysis results. Associated small molecules, including Estradiol, pirinixic acid, and Valproic acid, are potential therapeutic drugs for sepsis. CONCLUSION: By integrating bioinformatics with machine learning models, we identified three mitochondrial and immune-related biomarkers (MSRB2, TSPO, and BLOC1S1) with diagnostic value for sepsis. These biomarkers provide new insights into subtype stratification, immune infiltration characteristics, and targeted therapy in sepsis."
41013598,Temporal phenotyping and prognostic stratification of patients with sepsis through longitudinal clustering.,2025,"Sepsis is a critical medical condition characterized by a highly variable and rapidly evolving clinical course, often necessitating early intervention and tailored treatment plans to improve patient outcomes. Due to its complexity and heterogeneity, understanding the progression of sepsis across different patient populations remains a significant challenge. In this study, we exploit a sophisticated analytical framework based on k-means multivariate longitudinal clustering to capture the diverse trajectories of sepsis. We do so by analyzing multiple clinical parameters tracked over time, providing a nuanced view of disease progression. By incorporating Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as the distance metric, the proposed method effectively accounts for temporal misalignments and variability in the rate of disease progression, an essential capability given the unpredictable and heterogeneous nature of sepsis. This integration enhances the model's ability to detect distinct temporal patterns and phenotypic subgroups that may remain undetected using conventional analytical approaches. By leveraging sepsis-related electronic health records (EHRs), which provide rich time-series data on laboratory results along with patient demographics and underlying health conditions, the proposed method reveals distinct sepsis phenotypes that reflect variations in disease progression. We perform several experiments varying the number of clusters and clinical variable combinations, evaluating the clustering performances using Silhouette score, Caliski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index, as reference quality metrics. Our results confirm the prognostic role of the Thrombin-Antigen complex and the Prothrombin Time-International Normalized Ratio for septic patients. Furthermore, to evaluate the relevance of subjects' stratification, the Adjusted Rand Index metric is used to quantify the survival prediction capability of our longitudinal clustering method, considering the 28-day death feature as the target variable. The same metric demonstrates that our proposal outperforms other longitudinal clustering algorithms available in the literature."
41013334,Association between the changing trends of platelet distribution width and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis: a multicenter study based on machine learning.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. Platelet distribution width (PDW), an indicator of platelet activation and variability, is associated with inflammation and coagulation dysfunction during sepsis. However, dynamic changes in PDW and their association with patient outcomes remain unexplored. This study investigated the relationship between changing PDW trends and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis using machine learning techniques for robust analysis. METHODS: In the model development cohort, inpatient admissions fulfilling the sepsis 3.0 criteria in the Intensive Care Unit of Shenzhen People's Hospital were analyzed. PDW measurements were obtained at six-time points: First Day (D1), Second Day (D2), Third Day (D3), and the last three days before discharge (LD-3, LD-2, and LD-1). PDW was compared between survivors and non-survivors. Group-based trajectory modeling identified distinct PDW trajectory groups, and patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. The model was externally validated at a second hospital using identical inclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1,090 and 429 patients with sepsis were included in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Four distinct PDW trajectory groups emerged in the development cohort: ""PDW Rapidly Increasing Group"" (n = 174; 15.96%), ""Low PDW Stable Group"" (n = 416; 38.17%), ""Moderate PDW Stable Group"" (n = 421; 38.62%), and ""High PDW Group"" (n = 79; 7.25%). Subjects in the ""PDW Rapidly Increasing Group"" were the oldest, exhibiting the highest levels of inflammatory markers, including Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and the highest hospital mortality rate of 55.2%. Conversely, the ""Low PDW Stable Group"" included the youngest patients, with the lowest inflammatory marker levels and a 16.6% mortality rate. Comparable trajectory groups, patient characteristics, and outcomes were observed in the validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Based on PDW trajectories, we identified and validated four distinct sepsis subphenotypes, each characterized by significant variations in inflammatory marker levels and clinical outcomes."
41013284,Inflammatory parameters in the prediction of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: a case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Although hypovolemia was long considered the main cause of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI), current theories explore multifactorial causes of injury (inflammation, immune response, ischaemia-reperfusion system and hypovolemia). The aim of this study was to determine the significance of inflammatory parameters (leucocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT)) and mean-arterial pressure (MAP)) in prediction of SI-AKI development. METHODS: A total of 257 septic patients (Sepsis-3 criteria) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on SI-AKI development (with SI-AKI, n = 133; without SI-AKI, n = 124). All patients had complete blood count with leukocyte formula, CRP, PCT, SOFA and qSOFA score available. Statistical analysis included non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, Spearman's correlations, ROC curve analysis, as well as binary logistic regression in order to identify independent predictors of SI-AKI. RESULTS: CRP (p < 0.001), PCT (p < 0.001) and NLR (p = 0.002) were higher in the SI-AKI group, and showed a significant correlation with creatinine levels (p < 0.001). MAP was significantly lower in the SI-AKI group (p = 0.043). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that CRP and PCT were only independent predictors of SI-AKI, along with SOFA score. ROC curve analysis showed that CRP >/= 199 mg/L, and PCT >/= 13ng/L represent the cut-off values for SI-AKI prediction. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results highlight the potential role of the inflammatory response in SI-AKI development."
41013175,Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis susceptibility through RAGE in sepsis acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication among critically ill patients, associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. There is an urgent need for novel biomarkers to assist in the early detection and management of AKI. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is an inflammation-related, immune-derived molecule implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including kidney diseases. METHODS: We characterized the ability of serum suPAR levels to diagnose AKI in 124 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Additionally, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms between suPAR and the development of AKI. We stimulated HK-2 cells with suPAR to investigate its effects on HK-2 cells. Additionally, Methods such as receptor inhibitors, protein docking, and co-immunoprecipitation were used to study how suPAR acts on HK-2 cells. We further explored whether the uPAR monoclonal antibody could alleviate acute kidney injury in septic mice. RESULTS: We found that serum suPAR levels were significantly elevated in patients with AKI. In addition, total suPAR/uPAR was elevated in the renal cortex of AKI mice, and serum suPAR levels were also increased. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that suPAR stimulation promoted endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HK-2 cells and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, mice injected intraperitoneally with recombinant suPAR also exhibited elevated ER stress in the renal cortex. Furthermore, we discovered that suPAR was immunoprecipitated with the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and recombinant suPAR labeled with FITC was fluorescently colocalized with RAGE on HK-2 cells, indicating that RAGE was involved in the signal transduction of suPAR. Additionally, protein docking results showed that suPAR can form a protein-protein complex with RAGE through hydrogen bonds. Pretreatment with uPAR monoclonal antibody alleviated kidney injury in septic mice and reduced the levels of ROS, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidneys of septic AKI mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that high levels of suPAR are positively correlated with the occurrence of AKI. suPAR promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress and increases susceptibility to apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. RAGE on the cell membrane can bind to suPAR, participating in the activation of suPAR-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Pretreatment with uPAR monoclonal antibody alleviates acute kidney injury in septic mice.

41012595,"Predicting COVID-19 Sepsis Outcomes: Roles of IL-6, Cardiac Biomarkers, Clinical Factors, and Vaccination Status and Exploratory Analysis of Tocilizumab Therapy in an Eastern European Cohort.",2025,"(1) Background: COVID-19 sepsis, marked by hyperinflammation and cardiac injury, poses significant challenges in high-comorbidity populations. This prospective cohort study evaluates the prognostic value of IL-6, troponin, NT-proBNP, and radiological findings for mortality and unfavorable outcomes in a post-2022 Eastern European cohort. (2) Methods: At ""Victor Babes"" Hospital, Timisoara, Romania (September 2022-December 2024), 207 adults with COVID-19 sepsis (Sepsis-3 criteria) were enrolled. Baseline IL-6, troponin, NT-proBNP, CRP, PCT, D-dimers, and chest CT lung involvement were measured. Unfavorable outcomes (in-hospital death, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor use) were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. (3) Results: Among 207 patients (mean age: 68.7 years, 54.1% male), 52 (25.1%) experienced unfavorable outcomes. Multivariable analysis identified IL-6 (OR 1.016 per pg/mL, p = 0.013), troponin (OR 1.013 per ng/L, p = 0.017), NT-proBNP (OR 1.009 per pg/mL, p = 0.049), >50% lung involvement (OR 1.835, p = 0.011), unvaccinated status (OR 2.312, p = 0.002), and higher BMI (OR 1.112 per kg/m(2), p = 0.005) as independent predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Tocilizumab use (n = 12) was associated with reduced mortality (p = 0.041). IL-6 (cut-off 39.0 pg/mL, AUC = 0.91) and troponin (cut-off = 111.3 ng/L, AUC = 0.88) showed strong predictive accuracy. (4) Conclusions: Elevated IL-6, troponin, NT-proBNP, severe lung involvement, unvaccinated status, and higher BMI predict adverse outcomes in COVID-19 sepsis. Tocilizumab may offer survival benefits, warranting larger trials. These findings support targeted risk stratification in high-comorbidity populations."
41011807,First Signs at Admission: Prognostic Value of Initial Proinflammatory Markers for Sepsis and Mortality in ICU Patients.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and due to its non-specific symptoms, diagnosing sepsis and determining its severity remains difficult. Delays in recognizing sepsis can significantly increase mortality despite advances in antimicrobial therapy and resuscitation procedures. Biomarkers can help detect the presence and severity of sepsis, distinguish between types of infections, and evaluate treatment response. This prospective study aims to determine whether biomarker levels measured at the time of intensive care unit (ICU) admission can assist in the early prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis of sepsis and bacteremia. Blood samples were collected from 132 ICU patients upon admission and analyzed for CRP, IL-6, PCT, SAA, and endotoxin levels. Patients were monitored for sepsis development, blood culture results, and mortality. IL-6 levels demonstrated a significant association with prognosis and identified as an independent risk factor. CRP and PCT levels exhibit a significant effect on the development of sepsis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Also, our study demonstrated that the presence of bacteremia in the initial blood sample taken from intensive care patients holds significant diagnostic and prognostic value even without waiting for species-level identification when combined with markers such as PCT, CRP, and IL-6."
41011104,The Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratios in Urosepsis.,2025,"Background and Objectives: The severe systemic response to urinary tract infections known as urosepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are simple blood tests that could be useful in predicting the outcome of sepsis. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, where our team studied 223 patients with urosepsis. The patients underwent Sepsis-3 criteria-based urosepsis and septic shock stratification followed by survivor and non-survivor classification. Clinical scores (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-SOFA, National Early Warning Score-NEWS), laboratory markers (NLR, PLR, PCT-procalcitonin), and patient outcomes were then analysed. Results: An admission NLR >/= 13 was a strong predictor of septic shock (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 2.10, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.25-3.54) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.40-4.28). While the prognostic value of the PLR remained moderate, the NLR demonstrated superior predictive power. As easily measurable biomarkers, the NLR and PLR provide valuable information to help clinicians identify at-risk patients during the early stages of urosepsis. Conclusions: The NLR is an independent predictor with high predictive value for both septic shock and mortality, performing as well as established clinical scores. The combination of these parameters with clinical assessments could lead to better early decisions and improved outcomes for patients with urosepsis."
41010852,Role of Extracellular Vesicles as Mediators of Cell Communication and Novel Biomarkers in Sepsis.,2025,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), typically <200 nm in diameter, have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication, transferring bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. This review focuses on the growing significance of sEVs in the context of sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection. Sepsis remains a major global health challenge due to its complex pathophysiology, rapid progression, and the limitations of current diagnostic tools, which often fail to detect the condition early or accurately assess the host's immune status. As interest grows in precision diagnostics, sEVs have gained attention for their potential as biomarkers in liquid biopsy-a minimally invasive approach that analyzes circulating vesicles to monitor disease. Small EVs reflect the physiological state of their cells of origin and can provide real-time insights into immune activation, inflammation, and pathogen presence. This review explores the mechanisms by which sEVs contribute to immune modulation in sepsis, recent advances in understanding their biogenesis and uptake, and their diagnostic and prognostic potential. By highlighting the role of sEVs in sepsis, we aim to underscore their promise in improving early detection, guiding therapeutic decisions, and advancing personalized medicine."
41010666,Improving Sepsis Prediction in the ICU with Explainable Artificial Intelligence: The Promise of Bayesian Networks.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, characterized by a complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation. Despite advances in patient monitoring and biomarkers, early detection of sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often hampered by incomplete data and diagnostic uncertainty. In recent years, machine learning models have been proposed as predictive tools, but many function as opaque ""black boxes"", meaning that humans are unable to understand algorithmic reasoning, poorly suited to the uncertainty-laden clinical environment of critical care. Even when post-hoc interpretability methods are available for these algorithms, their explanations often remain difficult for non-expert clinicians to understand. Methods: In this clinical perspective, we explore the specific advantages of probabilistic graphical models, particularly Bayesian Networks (BNs) and their dynamic counterparts (DBNs), for sepsis prediction. Results: Recent applications of AI models in sepsis prediction have demonstrated encouraging results, such as DBNs achieving an AUROC of 0.94 in early detection, or causal probabilistic models in hospital admissions (AUROC 0.95). These models explicitly represent clinical reasoning under uncertainty, handle missing data natively, and offer interpretable, transparent decision paths. Drawing on recent studies, including real-time sepsis alert systems and treatment-effect modeling, we highlight concrete clinical applications and their current limitations. Conclusions: We argue that BNs present a great opportunity to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and bedside care through human-in-the-loop collaboration, transparent inference, and integration into clinical information systems. As critical care continues to move toward data-driven decision-making, Bayesian models may offer not only technical performance but also the epistemic humility needed to support clinicians facing uncertain, high-stakes decisions."
41010644,Predicting Neonatal Morbidity and Correlations with Maternal and Neonatal Biomarkers in Connection with Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome in Premature Births.,2025,"Introduction: Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome (FIRS) is widely acknowledged for its contribution to neonatal morbidity in premature infants. Being a systemic inflammatory process triggered by intrauterine infections or other stimuli, FIRS has gained significant attention due to its complex implications for neonatal adverse outcomes: preterm birth, early onset neonatal sepsis, death or long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Fetal plasma Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels above 11 pg/mL define FIRS and serve as an essential biomarker, providing insights into the complex mechanisms underlying this response. This study aims to evaluate the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic differences between preterm neonates with and without FIRS. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted, involving 125 preterm neonates with gestational ages between 23 and 37 weeks, who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Emergency University Hospital Bucharest between April 2023 and April 2025. Infants were stratified into FIRS and non-FIRS groups based on the measurement of cord blood IL-6 levels greater than 11 pg/mL. Demographic, biochemical, and therapeutic parameters were compared across the two groups. Results: Preterm neonates with FIRS had significantly lower birth weight, length, and head circumference, and lower Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min (p = 0.001). FIRS was associated with a higher incidence of vaginal delivery, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and neonatal metabolic imbalances, requiring more respiratory support, longer antibiotic treatment periods, and more blood transfusions (p < 0.05). Neonatal complications such as early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS), respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were significantly more frequent in the FIRS group (p </= 0.01). Among maternal cervical screening, Chlamydia trachomatis was the only pathogen significantly associated with FIRS. Conclusions: FIRS in preterm neonates is linked to important perinatal inflammation, adverse short and long-term outcomes, and extensive medical intervention. These findings highlight the value of early identification of intrauterine inflammation and targeted neonatal monitoring strategies. Further studies are needed to explore long-term outcomes and improve diagnostic and therapeutic protocols."
41010574,Predictors of Mortality in Surgical Patients Admitted to a Tertiary Intensive Care Unit.,2025,"Background: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide critical support for patients after major surgery or acute abdominal conditions. Despite medical advances, mortality remains high in surgical ICU patients. This study aimed to identify clinical and biochemical predictors of mortality in surgical patients admitted to a tertiary ICU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study on 231 adult general surgery patients admitted to a tertiary anesthesia ICU between January 2018 and December 2023. Patients under 18 years or who underwent solid organ transplantation were excluded. Data collected included demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Hemoglobin-Albumin-Lymphocyte-Platelet (HALP) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio. Patients were divided into mortality and survival groups, with subgroup analyses performed for malignancy, sepsis, and trauma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox regression analyses were used to identify mortality predictors. Results: The ICU mortality rate was 64.9%. Significant predictors included age >/= 58 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.56), body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2) (OR 7.62), mean arterial pressure < 70 mmHg (OR 1.66), serum albumin < 21.3 g/L (OR 1.5), APACHE II > 18.5 (OR 2.42), and SOFA > 9.5 (OR 2.68). Mortality was also associated with lower GCS scores, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and inotropic support. The CRP/albumin ratio was significantly elevated in the mortality group (p = 0.024). Other inflammatory markers showed no significant differences. Predictive factors varied among subgroups. Conclusions: Older age, obesity, hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and high severity scores independently predict mortality in surgical ICU patients. Early risk identification may enhance management and improve outcomes in this population."
41009652,TRAIL and RIPK3 Do Not Predict Mortality and Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients at Admission to the Intensive Care Unit-A Single-Center Cohort Study.,2025,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a protein involved in apoptosis, and receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), implicated in necroptosis, are known to change during organ damage and have been studied as prognostic markers in sepsis; however, cell death mechanisms also play a role in other critical illnesses. This study aimed to assess the utility of TRAIL and RIPK3 in predicting mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI) among unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We performed a single-center prospective cohort study including 142 consecutive ICU admissions, collecting blood samples for TRAIL and RIPK3 measurement within 24 h of admission. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality and incident AKI during the ICU stay, with additional analysis of mortality over a two-year follow-up. Neither TRAIL nor RIPK3 levels at admission were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, long-term mortality, or AKI incidence. However, higher RIPK3 levels correlated with shorter time to AKI occurrence. These results suggest that despite earlier evidence supporting their prognostic value in sepsis, TRAIL and RIPK3 did not reliably predict outcomes in a heterogeneous ICU population, underscoring the complexity of critical illness and the need for multiparametric biomarker strategies to improve risk stratification."
41009426,Assessing Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibodies in Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Systematic Review of Efficacy and Safety.,2025,"This systematic review critically evaluates the efficacy and safety of monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibody therapies in adult sepsis and septic shock by synthesizing data from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) encompassing over 10,000 patients. Sepsis and septic shock continue to be major critical-care mortality causes worldwide because of simultaneous hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses. The clinical results from using targeted antibody therapies to manage this dysregulated response have shown inconsistent results. We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (through February 2025) to identify RCTs that compared mAb and pAb treatments to placebo or standard care in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock. Monoclonal antibodies against single cytokines e.g., Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and endotoxin, did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality in unselected cohorts, though subgroup analyses of patients with elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6) or early septic shock showed trends toward benefit. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) enriched for Immunoglobulin M (IgM) demonstrated the most consistent mortality reduction when administered early in hyperinflammatory phases. Emerging precision strategies-including checkpoint inhibitors targeting Programmed Cell Death Protein 1/Programmed Death-Ligand 1 inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), complement component 5a inhibitors (anti-C5a), and anti-adrenomedullin-were safe and improved organ-support-free days and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. According to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, evidence showed moderate confidence for mortality, high certainty for safety and low to moderate certainty for secondary outcomes. The use of broad single-target monoclonal treatments has failed to deliver significant improvements in sepsis patient outcomes. The most promising approaches for sepsis treatment involve biomarker-guided precision strategies and polyclonal IgM-enriched IVIG. Future sepsis trials need to implement rapid immune profiling and adaptive designs and combination regimens to achieve optimal efficacy and establish personalized guideline-based sepsis management."
41008774,Serum Galectin-3 and Presepsin Levels in Pediatric Familial Mediterranean Fever Patients During Remission: A Prospective Study.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, characterized by recurrent fever attacks and serositis. Galectin-3, a beta-galactoside-binding lectin involved in inflammation and fibrosis, and presepsin, an established biomarker for bacterial infection and sepsis, have emerged as potential biomarkers for improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in autoinflammatory diseases. However, their use in FMF patients is not sufficiently evaluated. This study aims to compare serum galectin-3 and presepsin levels in children with FMF and healthy controls and assess their correlations with conventional acute-phase reactants. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study included 74 children with confirmed FMF during attack-free periods and 67 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Clinical and genetic characteristics, complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were recorded. Serum galectin-3 and presepsin levels were measured. Group comparisons and correlation analyses were performed using appropriate statistical tests. Results: Median serum galectin-3 and presepsin was significantly higher in FMF patients than controls (p < 0.001). ESR was significantly higher in FMF patients (p < 0.001), while CRP and SAA showed no significant differences. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between galectin-3 and presepsin (r = 0.860, p < 0.001) in FMF patients, with neither correlating with other acute-phase reactants. Conclusions: Galectin-3 and presepsin were found to serve as novel biomarkers reflecting alternative inflammatory pathways in FMF, even during remission. These results, obtained during the attack-free period, indicate the need for further studies to determine the relationship between galectin-3 and presepsin levels and disease activity in FMF."
41007875,"Heparin Binding Protein in Sepsis-A Comprehensive Overview of Pathophysiology, Clinical Usage and Utility as Biomarker.",2025,"The heparin-binding protein (HBP) is an enzymatically inactive protein of the serine protease family that plays an important role in host response to stress, especially infection and sepsis. It is produced by activated neutrophils due to a variety of stimuli and is part of the immune response that leads to macrophage, lymphocyte, and neutrophil activation and monocyte adhesion. Its most common repository is the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils. HBP has been studied as a biomarker for several infections, including central nervous system infection, respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection, and in several settings, including the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit, with promising results. As a biomarker for infection and sepsis, HBP has been compared to other commonly used biomarkers such as Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio, White Blood Count, C-reactive protein, and Procalcitonin, with at least comparable performance. Its sharp increase is promising for the early detection of sepsis. The ability to differentiate inflammatory conditions from infections and bacterial from non-bacterial causes of infection has also been demonstrated. The sepsis-related organ damage, as it is represented by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, can also be reflected by the proportional increase in HBP. Consequently, HBP could be a helpful and promising biomarker for sepsis and infection."
41007866,Key Common Genes with LTF and MMP9 Between Sepsis and Relapsed B-Cell Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children.,2025,"Background: Pediatric sepsis is a life-threatening disease that is associated with the progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the recurrence of B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Although previous studies have reported a partial association between sepsis and ALL, there is limited research on the shared genes between pediatric sepsis and relapsed B-ALL. This study aims to further elucidate the more comprehensive and novel common genetic factors and molecular pathways between the two diseases. Methods: Gene expression datasets pertaining to pediatric sepsis (GSE13904, GSE80496) and relapsed B-ALL (GSE3910, GSE28460) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for this retrospective analysis. The initial analysis identified differentially expressed genes common to both pediatric sepsis and relapsed B-ALL. Subsequent investigations employed three complementary approaches: protein-protein interaction networks, molecular complex detection (MCODE) clustering functions, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination model to separately identify the diagnostic biomarkers for each condition. Importantly, key common genes were identified by overlapping the diagnostic genes for pediatric sepsis and relapsed B-ALL. Further characterization involved comprehensive functional analysis through the Metascape platform, construction of transcription factor (TF)-mRNA-microRNA (miRNA) networks, drug prediction, and molecular docking to explore their biological significance and potential therapeutic targets. Results: Comparative analysis of pediatric sepsis-related and relapsed B-ALL-related datasets revealed two shared genetic markers, lactotransferrin (LTF) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), exhibiting diagnostic significance and consistent upregulation in both disease groups. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis identified specificity protein 1 (SP1) as the principal transcription factor capable of coregulating LTF and MMP9 expression. In addition, molecular docking demonstrated high-affinity interactions between curcumin and MMP9 (-7.18 kcal/mol) as well as reserpine and LTF (-5.4 kcal/mol), suggesting their potential therapeutic utility for clinical evaluation. Conclusions: These findings elucidate the molecular pathogenesis involving LTF and MMP9 in pediatric sepsis and relapsed B-ALL, providing novel insights for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic development."
41007702,Immunodynamic Disruption in Sepsis: Mechanisms and Strategies for Personalized Immunomodulation.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP-Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration."
41007672,Distinct Plasma LPC Signatures Differentiate COVID-19 Sepsis from Other Sepsis Aetiologies.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Low levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in the blood can be used as a diagnostic marker for sepsis. SARS-CoV-2 infection, a more recent cause of sepsis, shares similarities with non-SARS-CoV-2 sepsis but also exhibits distinct features. We have recently shown that plasma cholesteryl ester levels are higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in patients without, and this study analysed whether this may extend to differences in LPC, a bioactive constituent of lipoproteins. Methods: The plasma levels of 13 LPC species were measured by flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) in 157 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis or septic shock. Of these patients, 24 had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Patients with SIRS exhibited higher plasma levels of the minor LPC species LPC 15:0 and 22:4 compared to those with sepsis or septic shock. Five LPC species were also reduced in the plasma of 31 patients with liver cirrhosis; therefore, patients with cirrhosis or SIRS were excluded from subsequent analyses. Compared to 76 non-COVID-19 patients with sepsis or septic shock, SARS-CoV-2 infection in 21 patients was associated with significantly higher plasma levels of ten individual LPC species and total LPC concentration. In patients with sepsis/septic shock, LPC species showed negative correlations with procalcitonin and interleukin-6, and positive correlations with gamma-glutamyltransferase and cholesteryl ester levels. In contrast, no significant associations were observed between LPC levels and C-reactive protein, aminotransferases, or free cholesterol. Conclusions: Differential LPC levels, despite comparable disease severity, may serve as metabolic biomarkers to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 sepsis from other causes of sepsis and inform targeted therapeutic approaches."
41007058,Hyperferritinemia and Macrophage Activation Syndrome in Septic Shock: Recent Advances with a Pediatric Focus (2020-2025).,2025,"Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a hyperinflammatory condition driven by uncontrolled immune activation, is widely recognized as a critical complication in pediatric septic shock. This syndrome shares pathophysiological features with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and other cytokine storm syndromes, and it contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric and adult patients. Hyperferritinemia-a hallmark of MAS-is not only a diagnostic clue but also a prognostic marker for poor outcomes in sepsis. High ferritin levels are strongly suggestive of MAS, yet even moderate elevations in combination with the trend of ferritin levels can be indicative of heightened mortality risk. Distinguishing MAS from severe sepsis or other hyperinflammatory syndromes in children (such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)) can be challenging, as clinical features often overlap. However, early recognition and timely immunomodulatory therapy, particularly corticosteroids and targeted biologic agents, can be life-saving. Recent advances emphasize a syndromic approach to diagnosing MAS within the spectrum of hyperferritinemic sepsis, using scoring tools or MAS-specific criteria adapted to sepsis or MIS-C contexts. Ongoing studies aim to refine biomarker-based stratification and therapeutic algorithms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on MAS as a complication of sepsis, including the diagnostic importance of ferritin levels, differential diagnosis with other cytokine storm syndromes, and the latest therapeutic approaches. It underscores the importance of early suspicion and intervention to reverse immune dysregulation and improve outcomes in critically ill pediatric patients."
41006466,Shared immune biomarkers in necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal sepsis identified via bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and neonatal sepsis (NS) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, yet their shared molecular basis remains poorly defined. In this study, we integrated two public transcriptomic datasets and applied differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost) to identify shared biomarkers. Four immune-related biomarkers (MAP2K6, CHKA, CA4, and ENTPD7) were identified and used to construct diagnostic models with high performance (AUC = 0.864 for NS; 1.000 for NEC). Immune infiltration analysis revealed distinct immune cell signatures and strong correlations with the selected biomarkers. Regulatory network construction further uncovered potential transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. These findings suggest a common immune-related pathogenesis underlying NEC and NS and highlight shared biomarkers with strong diagnostic potential. This integrative analysis provides a foundation for improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions in neonatal care."
41006287,InfEHR: Clinical phenotype resolution through deep geometric learning on electronic health records.,2025,"Electronic health records contain multimodal data that can inform clinical decisions but are often unsuited for advanced machine learning analyses due to lack of labeled data. Here, we present InfEHR, a framework to automatically compute clinical likelihoods from whole electronic health records without requiring large volumes of labeled training data. InfEHR applies deep geometric learning through a procedure that converts whole electronic health records to temporal graphs that naturally capture phenotypic dynamics, leading to unbiased representations. Using only few labeled examples, InfEHR computes and automatically revises probabilities achieving highly performant inferences, especially in low-prevalence diseases. We test InfEHR using electronic health records from Mount Sinai Health System and UC Irvine Medical Center against physician-provided heuristics on neonatal culture-negative sepsis (3% prevalence) and postoperative acute kidney injury (21% prevalence). InfEHR demonstrated superior performance: for culture-negative sepsis (sensitivity: 0.60 vs. 0.04, specificity: 0.98 vs. 0.99) and post-operative acute kidney injury (sensitivity: 0.71 vs. 0.20, specificity: 0.93 vs. 0.98). Our study demonstrates the application of geometric deep learning in electronic health records for probabilistic inference in real-world clinical settings at scale."
41005784,"From bedside to bug side: clinical, haematological and genetic markers of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates from children admitted with sepsis in Kaduna State, Nigeria - a protocol for a cross-sectional study.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis and antibiotic resistance constitute a deadly synergy, causing the loss of millions of lives across the world, with their economic and developmental consequences posing a threat to global prosperity. Their impact is disproportionately felt in resource-limited settings and among vulnerable populations, especially children. A key challenge is prompt diagnosis and timely commencement of appropriate antibiotic therapies. These challenges are compounded in low-income and middle-income countries by a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data, with Nigeria being one such country for which it is lacking. Kaduna is the third largest state in Nigeria, with over 10 million inhabitants, of whom more than half are children under 14 years old. While bacterial sepsis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are recognised as a growing problem in the state, there are huge gaps in the current understanding of their aetiology. This project employs a cross-sectional design to investigate the clinical and haematological markers of paediatric sepsis, alongside determining the bacterial cause and prevalence of AMR at four high-turnover hospitals in Kaduna State, Nigeria. Further, whole-genome sequencing of isolated bacterial pathogens will be performed to determine the genetic features of resistance. This project represents the largest surveillance study of paediatric sepsis in Kaduna to date. Additionally, we aim to use the clinical, haematological, microbiological and genomic data to derive predictive models for sepsis causes, treatment strategies and patient outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a hospital-based, cross-sectional study that will recruit up to 461 children with bacterial sepsis who were admitted at the two teaching and two general hospitals in Kaduna State, Nigeria. Children presenting with features of fever, subnormal temperature and body weakness would be recruited into the study and have their blood samples collected. The blood samples will be used for culture, complete blood count, HIV and malaria testing. Accordingly, we will capture clinical presentation, haematological characteristics, causative pathogen from blood culture and patient outcomes. Nutritional status, known congenital immunosuppressive diseases, HIV infection and malaria infection will also be determined and documented. The bacterial isolates will be phenotypically characterised for AMR and genotypically following whole genome sequencing. Known and potential confounders to the outcomes of bacterial sepsis would be assessed in all participants, and adjustment for confounding would be performed using logistic regression and/or stratification+/-Mantel-Haenszel estimator where applicable. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals were granted by the University of Birmingham (ERN_2115-Jun2024), the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTHZ/HREC/H45/2023), Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna (NHREC/30/11/21A) and the Kaduna State Ministry of Health (MOH/AD M/744/VOL.1/1110018). The study will be conducted using the international guidelines for good clinical practice and based on the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be disseminated via oral and poster presentations in scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journal articles."
41005024,Sepsis-related coagulation-inflammation score: Development and validation for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units worldwide, characterized by dysregulated host response to infection involving complex interactions between coagulation and inflammatory pathways. Current prognostic tools have limitations in capturing this pathophysiological interplay. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel Sepsis-related Coagulation-Inflammation Score (SCIS) to predict 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of adult patients diagnosed with sepsis according to Sepsis-3 criteria at a tertiary medical center between January 2017 and December 2022. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, coagulation parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen), and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, white blood cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified significant predictors of 28-day mortality. The SCIS was developed by assigning weighted points to independent predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis evaluated the score's predictive performance and clinical utility. The score was compared with established sepsis severity scores including SOFA, APACHE II, and DIC scores. RESULTS: Among 578 sepsis patients, 28-day mortality was 32.7 %. The final SCIS incorporated five parameters: platelet count, D-dimer, prothrombin time, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6. The SCIS demonstrated excellent discriminative ability for predicting 28-day mortality (AUC 0.86, 95 % CI 0.83-0.89), superior to SOFA (AUC 0.79), APACHE II (AUC 0.77), and DIC score (AUC 0.74). The score maintained robust performance across subgroups stratified by infection site, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction. A SCIS >/=10 was associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of 28-day mortality (95 % CI 4.2-7.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Sepsis-related Coagulation-Inflammation Score effectively integrates coagulation and inflammatory parameters to predict 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. This novel scoring system provides enhanced prognostic accuracy compared to established scores and may facilitate early risk stratification, therapeutic decision-making, and resource allocation in sepsis management."
41002784,"Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Medicine: Challenges Across Diagnostic Imaging, Clinical Decision Support, Surgery, Pathology, and Drug Discovery.",2025,"Aims/Background: The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical medicine has opened new possibilities for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic decision-making, and biomedical innovation across several domains. This review is aimed to evaluate the clinical applications of AI across five key domains of medicine: diagnostic imaging, clinical decision support systems (CDSS), surgery, pathology, and drug discovery, highlighting achievements, limitations, and future directions. Methods: A comprehensive PubMed search was performed without language or publication date restrictions, combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text keywords for AI with domain-specific terms. The search yielded 2047 records, of which 243 duplicates were removed, leaving 1804 unique studies. After screening titles and abstracts, 1482 records were excluded due to irrelevance, preclinical scope, or lack of patient-level outcomes. Full-text review of 322 articles led to the exclusion of 172 studies (no clinical validation or outcomes, n = 64; methodological studies, n = 43; preclinical and in vitro-only, n = 39; conference abstracts without peer-reviewed full text, n = 26). Ultimately, 150 studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed qualitatively. Data extraction focused on study context, AI technique, dataset characteristics, comparator benchmarks, and reported outcomes, such as diagnostic accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), efficiency, and clinical improvements. Results: AI demonstrated strong performance in diagnostic imaging, achieving expert-level accuracy in tasks such as cancer detection (AUC up to 0.94). CDSS showed promise in predicting adverse events (sepsis, atrial fibrillation), though real-world outcome evidence was mixed. In surgery, AI enhanced intraoperative guidance and risk stratification. Pathology benefited from AI-assisted diagnosis and molecular inference from histology. AI also accelerated drug discovery through protein structure prediction and virtual screening. However, challenges included limited explainability, data bias, lack of prospective trials, and regulatory hurdles. Conclusions: AI is transforming clinical medicine, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and discovery. Yet, its integration into routine care demands rigorous validation, ethical oversight, and human-AI collaboration. Continued interdisciplinary efforts will be essential to translate these innovations into safe and effective patient-centered care."
41002306,Pathophysiological Associations and Measurement Techniques of Red Blood Cell Deformability.,2025,"Red blood cell (RBC), accounting for approximately 45% of total blood volume, are essential for oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal. Their unique biconcave morphology, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and remarkable deformability enable them to navigate microvessels narrower than their resting diameter, ensuring efficient microcirculation. RBC deformability is primarily determined by membrane viscoelasticity, cytoplasmic viscosity, and cell geometry, all of which can be altered under various physiological and pathological conditions. Reduced deformability is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including sickle cell disease, malaria, diabetes mellitus, sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and storage lesions in transfused blood. As these mechanical changes often precede overt clinical symptoms, RBC deformability is increasingly recognized as a sensitive biomarker for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Over the past decades, diverse techniques have been developed to measure RBC deformability. These include single-cell methods such as micropipette aspiration, optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, magnetic twisting cytometry, and quantitative phase imaging; bulk approaches like blood viscometry, ektacytometry, filtration assays, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and emerging microfluidic platforms capable of high-throughput, physiologically relevant measurements. Each method captures distinct aspects of RBC mechanics, offering unique advantages and limitations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the pathophysiological significance of RBC deformability and the methods for its measurement. We discuss disease contexts in which deformability is altered, outline mechanical models describing RBC viscoelasticity, and provide a comparative analysis of measurement techniques. Our aim is to guide the selection of appropriate approaches for research and clinical applications, and to highlight opportunities for developing robust, clinically translatable diagnostic tools."
41001617,Examining Transcriptomic Markers Associated With Neutrophil Extracellular Traps to Predict Mortality Risk in Neonatal Sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonates are highly susceptible to sepsis, which is often accompanied by fatal coagulopathy. Anticoagulant therapies have not reduced sepsis-related mortality in clinical trials, possibly due to patient heterogeneity. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) enhance coagulation by activating platelets, suggesting that NET-specific biomarkers may identify patients who may benefit from targeted anticoagulant treatment. This study evaluated the association between NET gene expression and adverse outcomes in neonatal sepsis. METHODS: We analyzed whole blood transcriptomes from 123 neonates with sepsis and developed a predictive model, the NET score, based on NET-related gene expression. Model performance was assessed in two independent validation sets. Mediation and correlation analyses explored the relationship between the NET score and a coagulation score. Temporal transcriptomic data from septic shock cases further tested this interaction. RESULTS: The NET score achieved AUCs of 88.7% and 85.4% in validation Sets 1 and 2, respectively, indicating strong predictive performance. Mediation and temporal analyses supported a sequential relationship between NETosis and coagulation in sepsis. Age-specificity of the model was confirmed using pediatric (n = 163) and adult (n = 86) sepsis transcriptomic datasets. Neonates with disseminated intravascular coagulation exhibited a trend toward elevated NET scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a novel risk stratification approach using the NET score to identify neonates at increased risk for sepsis-associated coagulopathy and poor outcomes, potentially guiding targeted therapeutic strategies."
41000205,Endothelial Injury-Induced Shedding of Thrombomodulin as a Biomarker for Predicting Adverse Prognosis in Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis-associated endothelial injury drives thrombomodulin (TM) shedding and severe coagulopathy. We hypothesized that plasma TM levels predict sepsis severity and prognosis. This study investigated the prognostic association of plasma TM as a sepsis biomarker and validated it in a murine model. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort (Gongli Hospital, Shanghai; July 2024-January 2025), 68 sepsis patients (45 survivors, 23 nonsurvivors) and 50 controls underwent plasma TM, CD64 index, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score assessments. Survival analysis, multivariable regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve modeling were performed. Mechanistic validation utilized Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) mice with plasma/aortic TM quantification. RESULTS: Elevated plasma TM and CD64 index correlated with poor prognosis (p<0.05). The combined TM/CD64 Index ROC model achieved superior predictive performance (AUC=0.9671, p<0.05) compared with TM alone (AUC=0.9333) or CD64 alone (AUC=0.8628). The multiple linear regression model indicated a positive correlation between TM levels in sepsis patients and SOFA and APACHE II scores. In vivo, experiments indicate plasma TM increased while aortic endothelial TM expression decreased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the combined plasma TM and CD64 index assessment enhances early prediction of adverse sepsis outcomes, with strong correlations to clinical severity scores. The paradoxical TM dynamics (plasma elevation vs endothelial depletion) suggest endothelial injury as a key mechanism. Future research should focus on multicenter validation, and mechanistic studies are warranted to optimize clinical translation."
40999897,"Alstonia boonei stem bark aqueous extract ameliorates elevated parasitemia levels, normalises blood glucose, modulates inflammatory biomarkers and enhances antioxidant status in Plasmodium berghei-infected/diabetic mice.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: Malaria and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often coexist in sub-Saharan Africa, worsening disease burden and complicating treatment. This study evaluated the protective effects of Alstonia boonei stem bark aqueous extract on Plasmodium berghei-infected diabetic mice. METHODS: Male mice were divided into five groups: normal control, untreated infected/diabetic, chloroquine-metformin treated, and extract-treated groups (40 and 80 mg/kg body weight). Fasting blood glucose, parasitemia, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory markers, and hematological indices were assessed following treatment. RESULTS: Untreated infected/diabetic mice exhibited significant hyperglycemia, elevated parasitemia, oxidative stress, anemia, and dysregulated inflammatory responses compared with controls. Administration of A. boonei extract produced a dose-dependent reduction in fasting blood glucose and parasitemia, alongside inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. The extract enhanced antioxidant status (SOD, catalase, GSH), restored red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and packed cell volume, reduced C-reactive protein levels, and elevated interleukin-10. These effects were more pronounced at 80 mg/kg and comparable to the standard drug group. CONCLUSIONS: A. boonei stem bark aqueous extract demonstrated antihyperglycemic, antiplasmodial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects in malaria-diabetes comorbidity. The findings support its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for managing malaria and diabetes co-occurrence."
40999545,Sepsis-induced hypocholesterolemia is linked to low cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol and impaired catecholamine responsiveness.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIM) is characterized by myocardial dysfunction, diminished catecholamine responsiveness and worse outcomes. Hypocholesterolemia is also a well-recognized prognosticator of poor outcomes in sepsis. In vitro physiology/pharmacology studies indicate that low cholesterol levels within the cardiomyocyte membrane regulate ss-adrenergic receptor activity. We therefore hypothesized that cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol levels are reduced in sepsis and this contributes to SIM. METHODS: Cardiovascular biomarkers and plasma lipid profiles measured sequentially (6, 24 and 72 h) in a fluid-resuscitated rat model of fecal peritonitis were compared against those measured in 27 septic patients on Days 1-3 of ICU admission. In separate studies, rat hearts were excised at the same time points for measurement of cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol and downstream adrenergic signaling. In a final study, the impact of a 15-hour infusion of cholesterol, either given as HDL-cholesterol or liposomal cholesterol, commencing at 6 h post-sepsis induction, on dobutamine responsiveness and cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol levels was assessed. RESULTS: The magnitude of fall in stroke volume, rise in heart rate, plasma troponin and BNP, and fall in plasma HDL-cholesterol on ICU Day 1 in septic patients and at 6 h in the rat model all prognosticated for poor outcomes. In parallel, cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol fell in the rats, more so in poor prognosis animals, with a blunted inotropic response to dobutamine, indicative of SIM. Cholesterol administration restored cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol, dobutamine responsiveness and adrenergic signaling. CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term rat model of sepsis, that parallels changes seen in septic patients, cardiomyocyte membrane cholesterol fell with associated decreases in catecholamine responsiveness. These features could be restored by cholesterol infusion, suggesting potential utility as a therapeutic."
40997317,A Retrospective Cohort Study on 28-Day Mortality in Immunosuppressed Sepsis: An Interpretability-Based Predictive Model Using MIMIC-IV v2.2.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis in immunosuppressed patients is associated with significantly higher mortality rates, yet predictive models tailored to this high-risk population remain limited. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict 28-day mortality in immunosuppressed sepsis patients, with a focus on model transparency and clinical applicability. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using clinical, laboratory, and demographic data from immunosuppressed sepsis patients. Feature selection was performed using LASSO regression, followed by the development of predictive models, including XGBoost. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To enhance clinical interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed to provide insights into the contribution of individual features to mortality predictions. RESULTS: The final model identified key predictors of 28-day mortality, including lactate levels, red cell distribution width, platelet count, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. XGBoost demonstrated superior predictive accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96), outperforming other models. SHAP analysis revealed that elevated lactate levels and reduced platelet counts were strong risk factors for mortality, while lower lactate and higher platelet counts were protective. The model's interpretability provided clear insights into the role of each predictor, facilitating individualized risk stratification. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model, combined with SHAP analysis, offers an accurate and interpretable tool for predicting 28-day mortality in immunosuppressed sepsis patients. This approach enhances clinical decision-making by providing transparent insights into the factors driving mortality risk, thus supporting personalized and timely interventions aimed at improving patient outcomes."
40997309,Abnormal Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio is Associated with Poor Outcomes in Pediatric Sepsis.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, necessitating an early risk assessment to prevent delayed treatment and achieve optimal outcomes. This study investigated the association between systemic immune-inflammatory indices and clinical outcomes in children with sepsis. DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care children's hospital from 2015 to 2023. PATIENTS: Children aged 0-18 years admitted with sepsis. Patients were excluded if they lacked a complete blood count with differential on admission. RESULTS: In total, 420 patients were included. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was associated with higher mortality [hazard ratio 1.001 (1.000-1.002), P  = 0.032]. Incorporating PLR into the Pediatric Index of Mortality score improved the model discrimination for mortality (area under the receiver operator characteristic curves 0.705 vs. 0.774; area under the precision-recall curve 0.202 vs. 0.257). Similarly, adding PLR to the Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III improved the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves from 0.648 to 0.697. High PLR was also associated with higher odds of requiring intubation (OR 2.42, P  = 0.005) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 4.74, P  = 0.002) and with decreased subdistribution hazard ratio of extubation, intensive care unit discharge, and hospital discharge alive at 28 days (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.89, 0.72, and 0.76, respectively; all P  < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: High PLR at admission was independently associated with worse clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with sepsis. Adding PLR to the Pediatric Index of Mortality and Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III enhanced the predictive performance. PLR is a simple and readily available index that may improve early risk stratification in this high-risk population."
40997264,Pancreatic Stone Protein in Co-Evaluation with qSOFA and NEWS2 for Early Sepsis Detection at the Emergency Department.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Prompt sepsis identification at emergency department (ED) triage is essential for timely treatment and improved outcomes. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) in combination with the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) for early sepsis detection. METHODS: As part of the PROMPT study - a non-interventional, multicenter trial across six Greek hospitals - blood samples were collected within the first hour of ED admission. PSP levels were retrospectively assessed using nanofluidic near-patient immunoassay device (abioSCOPE, Abionic SA, Switzerland) in 362 adult patients with suspected infections and evaluated their qSOFA and NEWS2 scores. Objectives included evaluating qSOFA's performance, assessing the performance of PSP to identify high-risk patients with qSOFA </=1, and determining the added value of combining PSP with qSOFA or NEWS2 (cut-off >/=7), using standard performance metrics. RESULTS: Among 156 sepsis cases, 128 (82.1%) had qSOFA scores </=1. A qSOFA score >/=2 demonstrated a sensitivity of 17.9% and a specificity of 97.1%. In comparison, a qSOFA score of 1 showed a sensitivity of 44.2% and a specificity of 63.6%, while a score of 0 yielded a sensitivity of 37.8% and a specificity of 39.3%.The addition of PSP (cut-off: 300 ng/mL) to qSOFA </=1 improved specificity to 94.0%, with a sensitivity of 14.8%-closely mirroring the performance of qSOFA >/=2. Similarly, combining PSP with NEWS2 <7 increased true positive cases from 34 to 52, enhancing sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the utility of combining PSP level in the patient's blood with existing scoring systems to enhance early sepsis detection in high-risk ED patients. Future research will explore near-patient PSP measurements at ED triage to further refine and expedite sepsis management."
40997262,Blood Biomarker and Raman Analysis of Leukocytes in the Multicenter Intelligence Trials: At the Intensive Care Unit (Intelligence-1) and the Emergency Department (Intelligence-2).,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, goes along with a complex and not yet fully understood host response. Despite many different biomarkers, optimal screening tools to identify patients with sepsis are still needed. In a previous, single-center clinical trial with well-defined and well-separated patient cohorts, a new biophotonic marker based on the Raman spectroscopic characterization of leukocytes showed added value to stratify patients and identify infection and sepsis. RESULTS: In the INTELLIGENCE studies, 279 patients from six centers in two countries were analyzed, and the Raman spectra of ~1500 leukocytes per patient were measured within only 1 hour. This marks a huge step from bench to bedside regarding usability and technology readiness level of Raman spectroscopy in multicentre clinical trials. With a discriminatory power comparable to individual conventional biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor), the Raman score of leukocytes could not provide added value to the clinical discrimination of sepsis in the INTELLIGENCE-1 study cohorts of intensive care patients with infections. When translating the classification model from INTELLIGENCE-1 to the heterogeneous patient cohort recruited at the emergency department of the double-blinded INTELLIGENCE-2 trial, the Raman score failed to provide added value. CONCLUSIONS: In theory, Raman assessment of leukocytes might still be a promising tool for sepsis diagnosis and patient stratification, but there is more basic, translational, and clinical research needed to refine its usability and clinical role, probably also taking questions of the pathophysiology of the dysregulated host response for a phenotype stratification into account."
40997178,From reactive to proactive: Continuous protein monitoring for preventive health care.,2025,"Continuous biomarker monitoring is revolutionizing chronic disease management, with glucose monitoring for diabetes as the primary example. Given the success of this approach, a transition to continuous protein monitoring (CPM, a real-time, implantable or wearable technology) could similarly advance precision medicine. In this work, we review state-of-the-art CPM platforms and their prospective clinical impact across both chronic disorders-metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative-and acute crises, such as sepsis and transplant dysfunction. We also highlight remaining barriers to widespread adoption, including sensor stability, robust machine learning models for live interpretation, and responsible data handling for patient privacy. With continued engineering and clinical validation, emerging biosensor technologies could transform disease management, facilitating earlier interventions and individualizing treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes."
40995285,Role of Serum Procalcitonin in Predicting the 30-Day Postoperative Mortality Rate in the Elderly Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Postoperative complications are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among elderly patients, largely due to age-related physiological decline, increased comorbidities, and heightened susceptibility to infection. Procalcitonin (PCT), a peptide biomarker associated with systemic bacterial infection, has gained recognition for its diagnostic relevance in critical care and infectious disease settings. While PCT has shown promise in identifying sepsis and guiding antimicrobial therapy, its utility in surgical contexts, especially within geriatric populations, remains incompletely defined. This review aims to evaluate the predictive capacity of perioperative PCT measurements in estimating 30-day mortality and infection-related outcomes in elderly surgical patients, offering insight into its potential role in perioperative risk stratification and management. A systematic review was conducted using 11 studies involving patients aged 65 years and older who underwent cardiac, orthopaedic, thoracic, abdominal, or general surgery. Eligible studies were selected based on their evaluation of serum PCT levels measured perioperatively and the documented association with either 30-day postoperative mortality or infectious complications. Key parameters, such as study design, patient demographics, timing of PCT measurement, biomarker thresholds, and outcome definitions, were extracted. A narrative synthesis was performed, supplemented by pooled analysis of PCT kinetic trends to identify consistent patterns across clinical scenarios. Serial PCT measurements were consistently elevated in patients who developed postoperative infections, with values ranging from 0.69 to 1.16 ng/mL between days 3 and 8 post-surgery, compared to 0.03 to 0.18 ng/mL in non-infected controls (p < 0.001). Most infected patients showed peak levels within 48-72 hours postoperatively, while non-infected individuals exhibited transient elevations that resolved within the same period. Although four studies demonstrated significant associations between elevated PCT and early mortality, particularly when levels exceeded 0.8 ng/mL, the predictive value was inconsistent across other datasets. Mortality prediction improved when PCT was interpreted alongside clinical scoring systems such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), highlighting the benefit of multimodal assessment. PCT is a valuable biomarker for identifying postoperative infections in elderly surgical patients, particularly when measured in serial intervals and contextualised with clinical parameters. Its dynamic profile allows for early identification of infectious complications and supports timely intervention strategies. However, PCT's role in mortality prediction is less consistent when used in isolation, showing improved reliability when integrated with systemic assessment tools. Standardised protocols and large-scale multicenter studies are needed to validate its prognostic application and optimise perioperative surveillance in high-risk geriatric cohorts."
40994527,EMX2OS serves as a biomarker of neonatal sepsis and participates acute lung injury through enhancing ferroptosis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal Sepsis (NS) is an important cause of neonatal death, often accompanied by acute lung injury (ALI). Ferroptosis plays a role in infectious diseases, but its regulatory mechanism in NS-related ALI remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of EMX2OS in promoting ferroptosis in ALI. METHODS: The expression level of EMX2OS in peripheral blood of patients with NS and its diagnostic value were detected by clinical samples. LPS-induced A549 cells were used to establish an ALI model. The targeting relationship between EMX2OS, miR-654-3p and AKT3 was verified by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, detection kit and dual-luciferase assays, and the cell viability and ferroptosis level were evaluated. RESULTS: EMX2OS was highly expressed in NS and served as a potential diagnostic marker. In LPS-induced lung injury model, high expression of EMX2OS decreased cell viability and enhanced ferroptosis. Silencing EMX2OS had the opposite effects. EMX2OS regulated cell viability and ferroptosis through miR-654-3p/AKT3 axis. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals for the first time that EMX2OS serves as a diagnostic marker for NS and promotes ferroptosis through miR-654-3p/AKT3 axis, thereby exacerbating lung injury. EMX2OS to regulate ferroptosis may become potential therapeutic strategies for lung injury."
40994171,"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for the Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurse.",2025,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how medical information is processed and used; it has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and expedite diagnosis and treatment. Applications of AI, such as machine learning models, are increasingly employed to analyze large volumes of data from diverse sources and identify patterns associated with patient deterioration, such as sepsis and hospital-acquired infections. In wound, ostomy, and continence (WOC) nursing, AI is already influencing areas such as prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. Despite these advances, concerns about the ""black box"" nature of many AI models, where decision-making processes lack transparency and pose challenges to clinical trust and accountability. This article provides a historical context of AI, discusses its core concepts, and explores applications relevant to WOC nursing. As AI becomes integral to clinical practice, WOC nurses must be equipped with foundational knowledge needed to ensure that these technologies complement clinical expertise, maintain ethical standards, fairness, and accountability in patient care."
40994009,The conserved N-terminal histidine in an engineered peptide mediates sepsis treatment efficacy via dual binding to CD14 and LPS.,2026,"Sepsis remains a major clinical challenge due to the limited efficacy of existing therapies in controlling excessive inflammation. The engineered stapled peptide sHVF18, derived from an evolutionarily conserved thrombin innate fold, binds both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the LPS-binding groove of CD14, enabling dual targeting of bacterial components and host immune signaling. To define structural prerequisites for this dual action, we combined evolutionary analysis, in silico modeling, and experimental methods. Substituting the N-terminal histidine with lysine (K) or arginine (R) improved solubility, reduced aggregation, and enhanced interactions with LPS. However, unexpectedly, K substitutions impaired CD14 binding, whereas R variants retained weaker affinity, possibly through cation-pi interactions. The essential role of the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal histidine for CD14 interactions and therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated using LPS-induced shock and polymicrobial sepsis models. While the K variant exhibited superior efficacy in LPS-induced shock, its disrupted CD14 interactions rendered it ineffective in polymicrobial sepsis. In contrast, sHVF18, by engaging both LPS and CD14, effectively reduced inflammation and improved survival in polymicrobial sepsis. These findings highlight that targeting of both LPS and CD14 is essential for therapeutic efficacy, underscoring multivalency as a key principle for future sHVF18-based sepsis therapeutics."
40993359,Sex differences in preterm cytokine and inflammasome responses and modulation by exogenous sex steroids.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at increased risk of sepsis compared to adults and older children. Preterm immune cells have altered cytokine responses compared to term neonates and adults and all have sex-related differences in immunity. We examined inflammasome activation and cytokines with endotoxin and sex steroid hormones between preterm and term neonates. METHODS: Preterm (n = 40) and term (n = 32) peripheral blood samples were incubated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Estradiol (E2), Progesterone (Pg) or Pam3CSK4 and biomarkers were analysed by ELISA. Inflammasome genes, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), Interleukin-1 beta (IL1-beta) and Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM 2) were analysed with Taqman RT-PCR. RESULTS: IL-1beta cytokine expression was reduced by female sex hormones and notably the effect of estradiol was greatest in the preterm population. Female preterm neonates were more responsive to the anti-inflammatory effect of progesterone than male preterm infants. Term neonates had higher IL-1beta, IL-18 and IL-1RA expression than preterm infants. Overall, in preterms, E2 and Pg lowered cytokine expression levels. Inflammasome gene expression profiles did not differ between preterm male and female neonates. CONCLUSION: Sex hormones altered the expression of multiple cytokines, and cytokine responses differ by sex. Gestation plays an important role in the inflammatory response, and we note term infants have a more robust profile while preterm infants are more responsive to hormonal stimulus. Female sex hormones have an important role in modulating neonatal immune response and may contribute to the female immune advantage. IMPACT: Female sex hormones play an important role in modulating the neonatal immune response. This is reflected clinically by better bacterial clearance and improved sepsis outcome in females. This study aims to test the hypothesis that male and female neonates differ in their cytokine and inflammasome response and in response to endotoxin and sex steroid hormones. In preterm infants there is a sex difference in IL-1b responses which is observed rapidly following endotoxin stimulation. Differing immune responses according to sex has implications for future clinical application. Further work to characterise these sex differences may help in guiding therapy during sepsis."
40993326,Kinetics of adrenomedullin pathway activation in a porcine sepsis model and a human cohort of sepsis and septic shock.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction. The peptide hormone adrenomedullin (ADM) plays a key role in sepsis owing to its potent vasodilatory effects, ability to maintain vascular integrity, and critical role in modulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. To gain its biological activity, the inactive ADM precursor (ADM-Gly) is converted into its active form (bio-ADM) by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). Here, we present hourly resolved kinetics of ADM activation during early sepsis onset in a porcine model and analyze the AdrenOSS-1 human cohort data to assess biomarker changes in advanced sepsis progression. The porcine model data showed that both bio-ADM and ADM-Gly mean concentrations rose within the first two hours post-induction, preceding measurable sepsis onset, with a greater increase in ADM-Gly (260.8 +/- 92.0 pg/mL) compared to bio-ADM (28.0 +/- 12.9 pg/mL). PAM activity increased at 6 h (39.3 +/- 10.5 Units), accompanied by a rise in the bio-ADM/ADM-Gly ratio. AdrenOSS-1 study revealed that ICU sepsis patients had higher ADM-Gly (121.5 pg/mL [IQR: 44.4-284.1]) and PAM activity (23.5 Units [IQR: 17.7-32.7]) than controls. Elevated ADM-Gly (> 730 pg/mL) and PAM activity (> 35.1 Units) were associated with increased 28-day mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting higher ADM-Gly (603.5 pg/mL [IQR: 131.1-1443]) and PAM activity (28.3 Units [IQR: 19.0-45.1]) than survivors. This study provides novel insights into the dynamics of adrenomedullin (ADM) homeostasis during sepsis progression, highlighting the critical interplay between its glycine-extended precursor (ADM-Gly), fully active form (bio-ADM), and the amidating enzyme PAM. The findings demonstrate that early and significant elevations in ADM-Gly, accompanied by delayed PAM activity, result in incomplete ADM amidation, compromising endothelial barrier function. Elevated ADM-Gly and PAM activity were associated with increased sepsis severity and 28-day mortality, while a higher bio-ADM/ADM-Gly ratio was linked to improved survival. These results underscore the potential of ADM-Gly, bio-ADM, and PAM as biomarkers for sepsis severity and prognosis, and support therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing PAM activity to restore endothelial integrity and improve patient outcomes in sepsis."
40991976,Deep learning-based cross-device standardization of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for enhanced bacterial recognition.,2026,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful, label-free technique for pathogen detection; however, its broader adoption in clinical diagnostics is hindered by inconsistent spectral quality across portable and laboratory-grade instruments, limited cross-device reproducibility, and the poor generalizability of existing machine learning approaches. These limitations restrict reliable and rapid pathogen identification at the point of care. To address this gap, we collected SERS spectra from analytes spread on silver nanorod (AgNR) substrates using four portable Raman systems (Enwave, Tec5, First Defender, and Rapid ID) and one laboratory-grade reference device (Renishaw). The dataset included 20 analyte classes representing clinically relevant bacterial signatures and reference compounds. We propose a deep learning framework comprising: (1) SERS-D2DNet, a one-dimensional sequence-to-sequence neural network that transforms spectra from portable devices into high-fidelity laboratory-grade equivalents, and (2) SuperRaman, a lightweight super-operational neural network (Super-ONN) for efficient multiclass bacterial classification. Primary and ablation studies confirm the complementary role of domain transformation and classification, demonstrating improved feature separability and reduced misclassification rates. Quantitative results show that SERS-D2DNet reduced mean absolute error to 0.01 and increased R(2) to over 98 % across devices, while SuperRaman achieved up to 100 % classification accuracy post-transformation. Compared to existing approaches, SERS-D2DNet delivered the lowest MAE (0.024 to 0.034), while SuperRaman surpassed state-of-the-art classifiers. The combined framework requires only 6.6 million parameters, a compact 9 MB footprint, and a 3.27 ms inference time, making it well-suited for portable deployment. This study establishes a scalable, real-time solution for rapid sepsis detection and pathogen identification, bridging the performance gap between portable and laboratory-grade SERS systems."
40991175,Targeting the cytokine-redox axis: dose-dependent immunomodulation by methotrexate in a biomarker-guided ovine endotoxaemia model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and excessive inflammation are central to the pathophysiology of sepsis and its large-animal analogue, endotoxaemia. Current anti-inflammatory treatments in ruminants lack efficacy in modulating redox balance or acute-phase responses. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX), a known immunometabolic modulator, may offer targeted attenuation of these processes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and organ-sparing effects of two low-dose MTX regimens in a controlled ovine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxaemia. METHODS: 20 clinically healthy ewes were randomised into four groups (n = 5/group): Ctrl - (saline), Ctrl + (LPS), LD-MTX1 (LPS + MTX 0.45 mg/kg), and LD-MTX2 (LPS + MTX 0.90 mg/kg). Endotoxaemia was induced via intravenous Escherichia coli O55:B5 LPS, and MTX was administered intramuscularly 1 h post-challenge. Serum biomarkers (TAC, GPx, MDA, haptoglobin, ALT, AST, urea, creatinine and CK-MB), clinical parameters and behavioural scores were assessed at five time points over 24 h. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models with adjusted post hoc contrasts. RESULTS: Both MTX regimens improved TAC within 6 h; LD-MTX2 showed a higher 6 h peak vs Ctrl + (p = 0.0006) and LD-MTX1 increased TAC AUC(0)-6 h (p = 0.048). GPx displayed a Group x Time interaction: LD-MTX1 rebounded by 4-6 h, whereas LD-MTX2 recovered later by 24 h. HP was non-monotonic: AUC(0)-6 h was lower with LD-MTX1 vs Ctrl + (p = 0.045) but higher with LD-MTX2 vs Ctrl + (p = 0.0002). LD-MTX2 markedly suppressed fever (+ 0.36  degrees C vs + 1.88  degrees C in Ctrl + ; p = 0.0011). The organ signals were dose-specific; LD-MTX1 showed no biochemical organ stress, and LD-MTX2 caused transient ALT/AST rises (p </= 0.006) with renal indices trending lower and no CK-MB increase. The clinical and behavioural metrics mirrored these effects. CONCLUSION: Low-dose MTX at 0.45 mg kg(-)(1) produced early redox benefit with partial GPx recovery and lower HP AUC, without biochemical organ stress. The 0.90-mg kg(-)(1) dose improved temperature control and peak TAC but increased HP AUC and caused transient ALT/AST elevations, indicating a narrow therapeutic window. MTX, therefore, warrants evaluation as a precision, time-limited adjunct in early endotoxaemia/sepsis in ruminants, with dose selection guided by time-integrated biomarkers and early liver-enzyme monitoring."
40990680,Simultaneous assessment of stress hyperglycemia ratio and glucose variability to predict all-cause mortality in sepsis patients across different glucose metabolic states: an observational cohort study with interpretable machine learning approach.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and glycemic variability (GV) reflect acute glucose elevation and fluctuation, which are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with some diseases. However, the relationship between combined assessment of SHR and GV and mortality risk in sepsis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the associations of SHR, GV, and their combination with sepsis mortality among individuals with different glucose metabolic states, and to develop a mortality prediction model using machine learning (ML) models. METHODS: Patients with sepsis were screened in the MIMIC-IV database, stratified into normal glucose regulation (NGR), prediabetes mellitus (Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus (DM) groups based on glucose metabolic status. Associations with mortality were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, Cox proportional hazards model, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and landmark analyses. Five ML algorithms were employed for prediction, with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) interpreting key predictors. RESULTS: A total of 4838 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 68 years. Overall, 641 patients (13.2%) died in the ICU, and 936 patients (19.3%) died within 28 days after admission to the ICU. In NGR patients, combined high SHR (>1.23; highest tertile) and high GV (>28.56; highest tertile) - determined based on tertile distribution - conferred the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.40-3.04). Pre-DM patients with low SHR/high GV (SHR < 1.23, GV > 28.56) showed the greatest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.73-3.48). DM patients with high SHR/low GV (SHR > 1.23, GV < 28.56) had the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.06-2.01). Machine learning models - particularly XGBoost (AUC: 0.746), Random Forest (AUC: 0.776), and Logistic Regression (AUC: 0.776) - demonstrated the strongest predictive performance for these endpoints. CONCLUSION: The combined assessment of SHR and GV may provide useful information for predicting mortality in sepsis patients - particularly among individuals with NGR and Pre-DM. This integrated approach highlights the potential need for personalized glycemic management strategies, which warrants further investigation in prospective studies."
40990410,Relationship Between Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and In-Hospital Mortality in Sepsis Combined With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Modified by Mechanical Ventilation.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: This retrospective cross-sectional study examined the correlation between Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis combined with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and explored the modifying effect of mechanical ventilation on this relationship. METHODS: Logistic regression models were employed to explore the correlation between log SII and in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis were used to examine the predictive value of log SII for in-hospital mortality. Generalized linear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, and restricted cubic spline were used to explore the associations among log SII, in-hospital mortality, and mechanical ventilation states. RESULTS: A total of 1058 patients were enrolled. Log SII was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis combined with COPD (odds ratios for Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, and Model 4 were 3.116, 2.847, 2.244, and 3.495, respectively; p < 0.005; log SII as an optimal-threshold categorical variable). Additionally, mechanical ventilation was closely related to log SII (p < 0.05). There was a stronger correlation between log SII and in-hospital mortality of patients who received mechanical ventilation, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An elevated SII independently predicts elevated in-hospital mortality risk in sepsis-COPD patients. This association is strongly intensified by mechanical ventilation, particularly the invasive mode. SII serves as a valuable biomarker for risk stratification in this vulnerable population."
40989398,Efficient sepsis detection using deep learning and residual convolutional networks.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection that leads to extensive tissue damage. If not treated promptly, it can become fatal. Early identification and diagnosis of sepsis are critical to improving patient outcomes. Although recent technological advancements have aided sepsis detection, challenges remain in timely diagnosis using standard clinical practices. In this article, we present a new deep learning model to detect the occurrence of sepsis and the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA) to enhance the model performance. The system comprises four crucial steps: First, the enhanced convolutional learning framework (ECLF) with atrous convolutional and multi-level strategies that aim to learn high-level features from the nonlinear mapping of the medical data. Second is the spatio-channel attention network (SCAN), which has a neural architecture designed to focus on significant regions, such as spatial and channel regions, but not restricted to them. Third is the hierarchical dilated convolutional block (HDCB), which utilises a stacked dilated deep convolutional architecture for spatial feature context retrieval. Last is the residual path convolutional chain (RPCC), which uses a multi-residual convolutional approach for feature propagation, preserving important information. The sepsis detection model we bring forth involves many components, as mentioned above, and thus achieves a higher accuracy for timely intervention during sepsis. The combination of AVOA into the model ensures that it is robust and easily transferable, delivering high performance for adaptation to complicated structures inside medical datasets. The proposed model was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 99.4%, precision of 98%, recall of 99.2%, F1-score of 99.0%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.998. These results demonstrate the model's superior ability to detect sepsis accurately and reliably, outperforming traditional clinical scoring methods and conventional machine learning approaches."
40987742,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia biomarker evaluation (VIBE) study: protocol for a prospective, observational, case-cohort study.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Current guideline-recommended antibiotic treatment durations for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are largely standardised, with limited consideration of individual patient characteristics, pathogens or clinical context. This one-size-fits-all approach risks both overtreatment-promoting antimicrobial resistance and adverse drug events-as well as undertreatment, increasing the likelihood of pneumonia recurrence and sepsis-related complications. There is a critical need for VAP-specific biomarkers to enable individualised treatment strategies. The Ventilator-associated pneumonia Biomarker Evaluation (VIBE) study aims to identify a dynamic alveolar biomarker signature associated with treatment response, with the goal of informing personalised antibiotic duration in future clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: VIBE is a prospective, observational, case-cohort study of 125 adult patients with VAP in Michigan Medicine University Hospital intensive care units. Study subjects will undergo non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage on the day of VAP diagnosis (Day 1) and then on Days 3 and 5. Alveolar biomarkers (quantitative respiratory culture bioburden, alveolar neutrophil percentage and pathogen genomic load assessed via BioFire FilmArray polymerase chain reaction) will be assessed. An expert panel of intensivists, blinded to biomarker data, will adjudicate each patient's Day 10 outcome as VAP clinical cure (control) or treatment failure (case). Absolute biomarker levels and mean-fold changes in biomarker levels will be compared between groups. Data will be used to derive a composite temporal alveolar biomarker signature predictive of VAP treatment failure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB #HUM00251780). Informed consent will be obtained from all study participants or their legally authorised representatives. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and feedback into clinical guidelines committees."
40986080,"Effect of probiotics on intestinal permeability in critically ill children with sepsis: preliminary results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",2025,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether probiotics have effects on intestinal permeability in children with sepsis. METHODS: Septic children who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were included in this randomized double-blind study. Children received 2*10(9) CFU/day probiotics or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was change in the markers of intestinal permeability, the serum levels of zonulin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), within 7 days. The secondary outcomes included inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein (CRP), changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, need for mechanical ventilation and vasoactive, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS), septic shock, and healthcare-associated infections (HCAI)s, duration of PICU/hospital stays, and hospital mortality. RESULTS: After 1 week of therapy, the levels of zonulin and LBP were reduced in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group, albeit there were no significant between-group differences for both (P = 0.88 for zonulin, P = 0.53 for LBP). In terms of inflammatory cytokines, probiotic usage led to a significant reduction in IL-6 (- 25.1 +/- 29.1 pg/mL, P = 0.001) and an increase in IL-10 levels (25.4 +/- 41.6 pg/mL, P < 0.001) with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001). There were no differences between groups for other secondary outcomes, PICU/hospital stay, and mortality. Likewise, no serious side effects were seen after probiotic treatment in the study group. CONCLUSION: Treatment of pediatric septic with probiotics was followed by improvement in inflammatory cytokines. Although we are not able to infer those probiotics provided benefit for intestinal permeability markers and known important clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis.

40986015,Monocyte HLA-DR expression in septic shock patients: insights from a 20-year real-world cohort of 1023 cases.,2025,"PURPOSE: Septic patients simultaneously experience hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, the latter driving ICU-acquired infections, prolonged stays in ICU, and increased mortality. As immunostimulant therapies enter clinical trials, effective stratification is critical to identify patients with the most profound immune dysfunction. Monocyte HLA-DR expression (mHLA-DR) has emerged as the most reliable and actionable biomarker of sepsis-induced immunosuppression. METHODS: We conducted a real-world, 20-year cohort study of 1023 septic shock patients, measuring mHLA-DR by standardized flow cytometry during the first week of ICU admission. Primary outcomes included day-28 and day-90 mortality, and ICU-acquired infections. RESULTS: Low mHLA-DR (< 8000 AB/C, a threshold already used in phase II trials) was significantly associated with increased mortality and ICU-acquired infections. This association held across static and dynamic measures, multivariate analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and trajectory clustering (K-means). CONCLUSIONS: This large real-world study confirms that mHLA-DR is a robust enrichment biomarker for identifying the most immunosuppressed septic shock patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Importantly, time-course analysis suggests that early immune downregulation may represent a physiological adaptation, while delayed and persistent immunosuppression is associated with worse outcomes. Early single time-point measurements may fail to identify patients who are unlikely to develop delayed immunosuppression. Tracking mHLA-DR trajectories after the initial ICU days is essential for detecting persistent immune dysfunction and selecting patients in case of immunostimulant approaches."
40985695,"Stenotrophomonas muris-first discovered as a potential human pathogen with strong virulence and antibiotic resistance, associated with bloodstream infections.",2025,"For the first time, Stenotrophomonas muris, whose pathogenic potential for humans has never been reported previously, has been identified to be associated with human infections. In this work, the phenotype of S. muris virulence, the potential genes that encode higher virulence of S. muris, and host responses to S. muris infection were investigated for the first time. It was found that S9 (S. muris no. 9, isolated from the patient's bloodstream infection) was more virulent than both S8 (S. muris no. 8, isolated from the patient's sputum) and S1 (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia type strain ATCC13637). Candidate genes that may encode higher virulence of S9 were identified, including virB6, dcm, hlyD, and 14 other genes involved in porphyrin metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, DNA methylation, two-component system, and biofilm formation. Transcriptome analysis of infected host cells (THP-1 cells) showed that 13 candidate genes involved in host response to hypoxia (HILPDA, FOXH1, ANGPTL4, SLC2A1, HK2, ADM, CXCR4, BNIP3, PLAT, PLOD2, STC2, STC1, and AK4) were preferentially upregulated by the more virulent strain S9 over the less virulent S8. Two downregulated genes (SLC26A11 and SLC8A1) involved in monoatomic ion transport and the calcium signaling pathway may also need special attention, as they may be involved in pathogenesis. Antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that strains S8 and S9 demonstrated high resistance to colistin and polymyxin B, with MIC values surpassing clinical breakpoints. For ceftazidime (a cephalosporin) and levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone), MIC values were elevated in S8/S9 compared to S1 but remained within the susceptible range (ceftazidime: S8 and S9; levofloxacin: S8) or intermediate category (levofloxacin: S9). Because of the above differences in virulence properties and antibiotic susceptibility, it is critical that S. muris be distinguished from S. maltophilia in a clinical setting for improved care. This work provides the basis for future studies on pathogenic mechanisms of S. muris and for developing improved treatment in the future. IMPORTANCE: Stenotrophomonas muris was first discovered as a potential human pathogen. Since it shares 99.72% similarity of the 16S rRNA to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, conventional diagnostic methods usually classify it as S. maltophilia clinically. However, the two human pathogens should be distinguished. The reason is that they have different virulence and different drug susceptibilities, which result in different administrations of drugs to treat their infections. To better distinguish these two pathogens and treat infections of S. muris, we investigated the virulence genes, the host response of S. muris infections, and susceptibility of S. muris to different drugs. The results we show in this paper will guide researchers to identify virulence genes, diagnostic biomarkers, and targets to develop treatment strategies for S. muris infections."
40983807,Prognostic Value of Serum (1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan Levels in Patients with Candidemia Stratified by Compliance with Candida Bundle: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study (2016-2023).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a severe systemic infection with a high mortality risk. While beta-D-glucan (BDG) serves as a diagnostic biomarker, its prognostic value in candidemia, particularly in association with Candida bundle compliance, remains unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we evaluated 96 patients with candidemia across nine Japanese hospitals between 2016 and 2023. Candida bundle compliance was assessed using five key components: central venous catheter removal within 24 h of diagnosis, appropriate initial antifungal therapy, ophthalmologic examination, follow-up blood cultures until clearance, and antifungal therapy for at least two weeks post-clearance. Analyses stratified patients by serum BDG status (positive/negative) and compliance with the Candida bundle (high: 4-5 points; low: 0-3 points). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcome was defined as endophthalmitis incidence. RESULTS: Of 96 eligible patients with candidemia, 70 (72.9%) were BDG-positive and 26 (27.1%) were BDG-negative. The overall 30-day mortality was 17.7%. Among BDG-positive patients, 15 (21.4%) died, while 2 (7.7%) died in BDG-negative cohorts (p = 0.09). Serum BDG positivity demonstrated a statistically significant association with decreased survival rates in the low bundle adherence group (p = 0.02), whereas this correlation was not observed among patients in the high-compliance cohort (p = 0.66). Endophthalmitis occurred in 25.0% of patients, without significant correlation to serum BDG status. C. albicans was associated with a significantly higher incidence of endophthalmitis compared with non-albicans species (45.7% vs. 8.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Serum BDG positivity potentially correlates with worse survival in candidemia, particularly in patients with low bundle compliance. This emphasizes the importance of adherence to standardized Candida management protocols for optimizing patient outcomes."
40981485,Two Physiologic Latent Classes of Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Sepsis Are Distinguished by Lung Mechanics and Gas Exchange.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Physiologic subtypes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) may confer a differential response to treatments, particularly therapeutic strategies that are specific to pulmonary organ failure. We sought to identify physiologic latent classes of sepsis-associated AHRF defined by respiratory mechanics, oxygenation, ventilation, and radiographic patterns of lung injury, and to determine the association between class membership and 30-day mortality. DESIGN: We performed latent class analysis of patients with AHRF newly requiring mechanical ventilation enrolled in a prospective cohort of patients with sepsis from 2011 to 2020. We used logistic regression adjusted for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation to determine the association between class membership and 30-day mortality and examined the distribution of patients classified as ""hyperinflammatory"" by previously described biomarker-based subphenotyping paradigms. SETTING: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. PATIENTS: Eight hundred eighty-two patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified two physiologic latent classes. Class 1 (n = 390) was characterized by low static compliance and impaired ventilation when compared with class 2 (n = 432). Mortality at 30 days was higher in the more physiologically severe class 1 when compared with class 2 (adjusted risk difference 0.12, p < 0.001) despite a similar severity of sepsis. Class 1 also contained a higher proportion of female patients and patients with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two physiologic latent classes of sepsis-associated AHRF. Relative to class 2, class 1 was distinguished by low compliance, impaired ventilation, and higher 30-day mortality independent of the severity of sepsis. The higher percentage of female patients and patients with obesity in class 1 suggests a potential role for body composition in class determination. Physiologic classes were not primarily determined by qualification for acute respiratory distress syndrome or previously described biomarker-based subphenotypes, suggesting a distinct physiologic ""axis"" of heterogeneity."
40977431,Mid-Regional Proadrenomedullin in Cerebrospinal Fluid Is a Reliable Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker for Acute Meningoencephalitis and Neurological Disorders.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Despite numerous pieces of evidence of its important role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in infectious diseases and sepsis, adrenomedullin (ADM) was only poorly investigated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in central nervous system (CNS) infections. In this multicentre retrospective study, we investigated ADM CSF concentrations in acute meningitis compared to other noninfectious neurological disorders. METHODS: Since ADM is rapidly metabolised in vivo, the available diagnostic methods are designed to measure its cognate metabolite called mid-regional proADM (MR-proADM). We collected detailed clinical and laboratory data about 293 patients in whom MR-proADM was measured in CSF and plasma as part of the diagnostic workup. RESULTS: Patients were finally classified in CNS infection (n = 59), other CNS disorders (n = 190) and 14 disease controls, in which CNS infections and other definite disorders were excluded. Both cerebrospinal MR-proADM levels and their CSF/blood ratio were significantly higher in CNS infections compared to the other two groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.037 respectively). CSF MR-proADM resulted informative for patients' classification, furnishing a volume under the ROC surface of 0.513 [0.414-0.613], overcoming the 1/6 threshold value for undecidability. Threshold values of < 0.807 and > 1.590 nmol/L can differentiate controls from neurological disorders and neurological disorders from CNS infections respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated significant upregulation of Adrenomedullin in CSF during infections compared to other neurological diseases and proposed preliminary thresholds of CSF MR-proADM to be used in the diagnostic workup of acute CNS infections, to help with differential diagnosis and possibly guide targeted therapeutic interventions."
40975499,Inhibiting TIRAP-mediated inflammatory signaling: A promising therapeutic strategy against sepsis.,2025,"The timely therapeutic targeting of the dysregulated immune response in sepsis is essential to restore immune homeostasis and prevent progression to organ dysfunction. In this study, we investigated whether a combination therapy with an antibiotic exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties and the anti-inflammatory compound dorzolamide will improve the bacterial sepsis outcome. Using an in-silico approach, we screened a structure library of FDA-approved antibiotics to identify those that can interact with the Toll/interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), a protein regulating proinflammatory cytokine production in immune cells. Our virtual screening identified a broad-spectrum antibiotic, levofloxacin, as a candidate. We subsequently employed the cecum slurry (CS) septic mouse model to validate the candidates in vivo, while monitoring survival of mice, tissue mRNA expression, cell morphology, cytokine levels, and other biochemical markers. The in vivo studies confirmed that the combination of levofloxacin and dorzolamide (LeDoz) increased the survival rate of septic mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) tissue staining, cytokine levels, as well as immunofluorescence dual staining and serum biomarkers, all showed the reestablishment of homeostatic conditions in the LeDoz-treated group of septic mice compared to untreated septic mice. In vitro analyses also confirmed the ability of LeDoz to attenuate TIRAP-mediated inflammatory signaling. Thus, the combination of levofloxacin and dorzolamide exhibits both an antibacterial effect and a strong potential for synergistically reducing chronic inflammation in the host by inhibiting the activation of TIRAP."
40974763,Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on hyper-inflammatory response and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: There are still debates regarding the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on immune response and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: Explore the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on hyper-inflammatory response and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched five databases from inception to July 18, 2024 and collected randomized controlled trials in which critically ill patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) were administered omega-3 fatty acids as a supplement. Data were expressed as mean difference, standard mean difference, or odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: There were 41 randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria, and they involved 3152 patients. The intervention with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the following biomarkers: white blood cell count on day 3 and day 6/7, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on day 3 and day 5, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin at the last observation post-intervention. The intervention also reduced the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 5 and lowered the risk of secondary infections and new sepsis/septic shock, both determined during follow-up. It also significantly shortened the ICU stay and reduced the 28-day mortality rate, although ICU mortality rate remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation may be effective in modulating hyper-inflammatory responses, reducing the risk of complications and disease severity, and improving clinical outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Omega-3 fatty acids may serve as a potential nutritional therapy for critically ill patients, when medical staff identify the hyperinflammatory status of patients based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results."
40974188,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Life-Threatening Complications During Hemodialysis in Hospitalized Patients With Poor General Conditions.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) face a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality, with sudden events during treatment posing a critical threat to survival. These risks are particularly pronounced in high-risk populations, such as patients recovering from cardiovascular surgery or those being treated for sepsis. Therefore, the development of effective preventive strategies is essential for improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model that uses pretreatment patient characteristics to predict sudden adverse events during HD and within 24 h after treatment in high-risk inpatients at acute care hospitals. METHODS: His retrospective study analyzed data from 739 patients who underwent HD at Hirosaki University Hospital between 2018 and 2021. Sudden events were defined as fatal arrhythmia, refractory intradialytic hypotension, or respiratory arrest. A logistic regression model was constructed using backward stepwise selection from 51 patient characteristics (demographic data, clinical parameters, laboratory data, and HD-related information). RESULTS: Among the 739 patients, 17 (2.3%) experienced sudden events. The model identified 23 pre-HD covariates and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.889. Key covariates included emergency hospitalization (present in 71% of patients with sudden events), recent surgery (76%), shorter HD history, elevated pre-HD heart rate, lower serum albumin levels, and higher C-reactive protein concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our model enables the early identification of high-risk inpatients receiving hemodialysis using pre-dialysis data, thereby supporting timely clinical interventions, optimized resource allocation, and improved patient safety."
40972498,"Septic shock: Past, present, and perspectives.",2026,"Septic shock remains one of the most severe complications of infection, defined by circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction and associated with persistently high mortality. The concept has evolved markedly, from early descriptions of ""blood poisoning"" to the recognition of sepsis as a systemic syndrome in the late 20th century. Consensus definitions and large clinical trials, including early goal-directed therapy, led to structured treatment bundles and the launch of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which have contributed to gradual improvements in survival. Current management emphasizes rapid recognition, timely antimicrobials, source control, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support, with norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity among patients complicates decision-making, and debate continues around fluid thresholds, timing of vasopressor initiation, and the use of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids or immunomodulators. Looking ahead, precision medicine and emerging technologies promise to refine sepsis care. Machine learning and multi-omic approaches are improving risk prediction, enabling identification of sepsis subphenotypes, and guiding individualized treatment strategies. Bedside tools assessing microcirculatory function and rapid biomarker assays may further enhance prognostication and resuscitation. Effective implementation science and rigorous validation of these tools will be critical for translating innovation into improved outcomes. Septic shock management has advanced substantially, yet further progress requires not only personalization and innovation but also concerted efforts to reduce global disparities in access to timely diagnosis, evidence-based treatment, and long-term survivorship care."
40971058,Enteral versus parenteral nutrition in auto-HCT: a randomized controlled trial on clinical outcomes and gut microbiome dynamics.,2025,"Disruption of the gut microbiome is a common consequence of chemotherapy, linked with detrimental treatment outcomes (e.g. sepsis), especially in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Preclinical data suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) is superior to parenteral nutrition (TPN), minimising gut atrophy and promoting eubiosis; yet, TPN continues to be used. Here, we evaluated the clinical effects of EN and TPN in autologous HCT recipients and their influence on gut microbiome dynamics. Despite efforts to optimise delivery, EN was poorly tolerated and ultimately proved unfeasible. As such, we turned our attention to analysing microbial dynamics in our study cohort and confirmed preclinical reports that epithelial apoptosis drives gut microbiome disruption. Machine learning models predicted microbial composition by tracking plasma citrulline trajectories, a biomarker of enterocyte mass. These findings suggest that (i) monitoring citrulline may be able to identify patients at risk of potentially lethal HCT complications associated with gut microbiome disruption, and that (ii) preserving epithelial integrity could support microbial resilience by minimising the production of caspase-dependent metabolites.

40970753,Rapid colorimetric antimicrobial susceptibilities direct from positive blood culture for Gram-negative bacteria.,2025,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) have become increasingly challenging to treat due to emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As rapid administration of appropriate antimicrobials is crucial to positive patient outcomes, clinical alternatives to slow phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) must be developed. We developed an automated real-time, colorimetric assay (ChroMIC) that phenotypically determines minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) directly from positive blood culture. Gram-negative bacteria within positive blood cultures from 83 patients were directly analyzed with ChroMIC. Both ChroMIC MICs and the much slower VITEK 2 MICs for each of seven antibiotics were compared to broth microdilution (BMD). Direct-from-blood-culture ChroMIC MICs were obtained without the ~18-hour growth and isolation steps needed to obtain both VITEK 2 and BMD MICs. ChroMIC assays yielded >90% categorical and essential agreement within 7 h from the start of the experiment and within 4 h of initial growth detection. ChroMIC minor, major, and very major errors were all comparable to, or in the case of VMEs, better than, those from VITEK 2 ASTs-the latter being performed only after an additional ~18-hour subculturing delay. As these patient blood samples were run in parallel with VITEK 2 MICs, a retrospective impact analysis on patient care suggests that ChroMIC could have facilitated faster therapeutic decision-making in nearly all cases, saving an average of >35 and >43 h for antimicrobial escalation and de-escalation, respectively, compared to VITEK 2. IMPORTANCE: The often sluggish pace of phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relative to sepsis progression, limits flexibility in altering patient treatment. We report a new direct-from-blood culture phenotypic AST that delivers excellent results within ~7 h of blood culture positivity. This rapid and accurate determination of optimal bloodstream infection treatment was compared in a retrospective study on patient blood cultures that flagged positive for Gram-negative pathogens. Although standard clinical methods were used to guide treatment, our testing was performed in parallel and could have enabled correction of the treatment course ~40 h earlier than was actually performed. Once clinically implementable, such innovative, low-labor, automated, and accurate susceptibility determinations hold great potential for improving patient outcomes and lowering overall healthcare costs."
40970024,C-reactive Protein Versus Procalcitonin in the Early Diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Neonatal sepsis is a systemic response to a bacterial infection within the first 28 days of life. Diagnosis remains a challenge due to the subtle and nonspecific signs, often resulting in the use of empirical antibiotics and their associated risks. This systematic review aims to compare the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in the early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The review was conducted using our search strategy across PubMed/Medline, PubMed Central, Europe PMC, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies included free full-text systematic reviews, narrative reviews, diagnostic accuracy studies, and observational studies published in English between 2020 and 2025. Studies published in foreign languages, based on non-human studies, as well as grey literature that lacked free full-text articles, were excluded from the analysis. The risk of bias was assessed using appropriate quality assessment tools. Of the 16 initially eligible studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria after quality assessment; these consisted of eight narrative reviews, three diagnostic accuracy studies, and one observational study. Our systematic review found that although CRP is widely utilized due to its low cost and simplicity, its limited early sensitivity and susceptibility to non-infectious factors reduce its utility in diagnosing neonatal sepsis. In contrast, PCT demonstrated an earlier rise, correlates with the severity of the disease, has higher sensitivity (reported as 97.6 and 97.7% in two studies), and can differentiate between bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. However, PCT displays a physiological rise, can be influenced by non-infectious factors, and is costlier. In both cases, serial measurements and the use of adjusted nomograms enhance their use. In conclusion, PCT demonstrates superior diagnostic potential and utility in guiding antibiotic therapy compared to CRP for early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, especially when used in combination with other biomarkers. As part of our review, we noted the absence of procalcitonin in current international neonatal sepsis guidelines, and we have proposed a flowchart to guide its potential integration into clinical practice. Future research should focus on large, low-bias studies, the identification of standardized cut-off values, the development of adjusted nomograms, and the validation of emerging diagnostic technologies. This systematic review is not registered, as PROSPERO currently does not support registration of diagnostic test accuracy studies."
40969714,Single-Cell Multi-Omics Deciphers Core Gene Networks and Immune Interaction Collapse in Sepsis-Associated T Cell Dysfunction.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by immune dysregulation, yet the mechanisms underlying T cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. METHODS: We integrated multi-omics data from public GEO datasets and prospective cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was applied to identify core genes, followed by diagnostic and prognostic validation. Cell-cell interaction networks were constructed to investigate signaling alterations, and cross-platform validation was conducted. RESULTS: Seven core genes (LTB, CD3D, TRAF3IP3, CD3G, GZMM, HLA-DPB1, CD3E) were identified, showing strong diagnostic value (AUC >/= 0.86) and prognostic significance (HR=4.50 for CD3E). Network analysis revealed collapse of critical signaling axes (HLA-DRA-MHCII, ITGB2-CD226) and aberrant activation of inhibitory pathways (LGALS9-CD45), leading to a ""co-stimulation inhibition-checkpoint activation"" imbalance. Cross-platform validation confirmed conserved downregulation of these genes in sepsis, which contributed to immune exhaustion via disrupted T cell differentiation trajectories and impaired intercellular communication. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for sepsis immunotherapy by systematically deciphering core gene networks and immune interaction collapse in T cell dysfunction."
40969510,"Sepsis Biomarkers: CRP, Procalcitonin, and Presepsin-Diagnostic and Prognostic Significance in Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is undeniably a serious worldwide health threat, causing millions of deaths each year and a real diagnostic challenge to the clinicians. The conventional standard culture methods are often negative and time-consuming; therefore, alternatively specific and easily measurable biomarkers could help in predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis, as well as monitor the response to the treatments. This study will compare the role of the three markers procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and presepsin in the diagnosis of sepsis in suspected patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2021 to March 2022. Blood samples were collected from the patients admitted in various intensive care units with evidence of sepsis and the biomarkers were estimated. RESULTS: Presepsin was found to be the best among the three biomarkers with sensitivity 89.1% and specificity 88.9%, followed by PCT with sensitivity 82.7% and specificity 80%, and then CRP with sensitivity 74.5% and specificity 75.6%. The diagnostic accuracy of presepsin was also found to be maximum as its area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was highest (0.858) followed by PCT whose area under the ROC curve was 0.793, and then CRP with area under the ROC curve 0.741. CONCLUSION: Based on the result of the present study, biomarkers were found to be quick, easy and effective test for diagnosing sepsis, and presepsin proved to be the most promising marker for diagnosis of sepsis as compared to PCT or CRP."
40967793,Comparative analysis of monocyte distribution width alterations in Escherichia coli sepsis: insights from in vivo and ex vivo models.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Monocyte distribution width (MDW) is an early sepsis indicator measuring monocyte heterogeneity during massive infection. We compared MDW changes in Escherichia coli sepsis patients with the effects of living E. coli and lipopolysaccharide in an ex vivo sepsis model. We also investigated the dynamics of monocyte morpho-functional and inflammatory responses in the sepsis model. METHODS: Whole blood from healthy participants was in vitro stimulated with live E. coli (10(6)-10(10) CFU/mL) and LPS (0.1-10 mug/mL). Complete blood counts, including MDW, were evaluated at different time-points using DxH 690T Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). MDW values were compared with those retrospectively obtained from sepsis patients (n=23). May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained blood smears were analyzed by digital cell morphology (CellaVision DM software). A panel of 27 inflammatory mediators was quantified in plasma (Bio-Plex 200). RESULTS: MDW values were early and significantly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner by live E. coli and LPS treatments (p<0.01). MDW values were significantly higher in sepsis patients compared to controls and overlapped those observed in the ex vivo model. IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8, MIP1-alpha, MIP-1beta, Eotaxin, G-CSF, and PDGF-bb were significantly modulated after treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the clinical utility of MDW in sepsis diagnosis and sustain the reliability of the whole blood assay as ex vivo sepsis model. E. coli and LPS directly promote early monocyte morpho-functional modifications, mirrored by high MDW values and pro-inflammatory mediators. These results improve the knowledge on the biological basis of sepsis, providing novel evidence on the usefulness of MDW in septic conditions."
40967091,Regulation of Intestinal Permeability in Health and Disease: Possible Therapeutic Applications.,2025,"Intestinal permeability is the process by which certain substances pass through the intestinal barrier and enter the bloodstream to reach the tissues and organs where they are needed. This vital process is regulated by various physiological mechanisms, depending on the type of molecule being translocated, from ions and water molecules to large peptides and vitamins. However, under certain conditions, intestinal permeability can increase, exposing the body to the passage of unwanted molecules and pathogenic microorganisms. The various mechanisms involved in increased intestinal permeability include the zonulin pathway, intestinal epithelial cell death, intestinal dysbiosis, and transcytosis. Each of these mechanisms is activated by certain stimuli, and may occur in isolation or together. The translocation of molecules and pathogens has been linked to the development or worsening of certain pathologies, such as acute pancreatitis, sepsis, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, depression, and schizophrenia. This is mainly due to the inflammatory response generated in response to the translocated microorganisms. Research has been conducted to develop therapies to decrease intestinal permeability in several diseases. This review summarizes knowledge related to pathways that regulate intestinal permeability, diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability, and advances in potential treatments."
40965651,Development and validation of an explainable machine learning model for predicting sepsis risk following flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy.,2025,"Sepsis is a severe complication of flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy (fURL), a widely used treatment for kidney stones. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model based on machine learning (ML) for assessing the risk of sepsis following fURL while enhancing its interpretability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). This retrospective study in China was conducted to develop and validate a prediction model for sepsis following fURL. The derivation cohort comprised 1,386 patients treated between 2019 and July 2024 divided into training and internal validation subsets. External validation was performed on a cohort of 604 patients treated between 2019 and 2023 at a collaborating center. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3.0 consensus guidelines. Fifteen machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models, and their performance was meticulously evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To enhance model interpretability, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was applied to assess and rank the importance of individual features. The Extra Trees (ET) model incorporating eight key features demonstrated the best discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.90. It accurately predicted sepsis in both internal (AUC = 0.87) and external validation (AUC = 0.81). In this study, we developed an Extra Trees (ET) machine learning model to predict sepsis risk following fURL, which demonstrated high accuracy in predicting sepsis in both the internal and external validation cohorts. This model, equipped with SHAP-driven interpretability and deployed as an accessible web application, has the potential to serve as a clinical tool for patient risk stratification following fURL."
40963763,Longitudinal multi-omic signatures of ARDS and sepsis inflammatory phenotypes identify key pathways associated with mortality.,2025,"Critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis exhibit distinct inflammatory phenotypes with divergent clinical outcomes and apparent heterogeneity of treatment effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenotypes, derived from clinical data and protein biomarkers, were associated with metabolic differences in a prior pilot study. This study investigated the metabolomic and transcriptomic differences between Hyperinflammatory and Hypoinflammatory phenotypes through integrative multi-omics analysis of blood samples from ARDS patients in the ROSE trial. Multi-omics integration revealed three molecular signatures strongly associated with the Hyperinflammatory phenotype and with mortality: enhanced innate immune activation coupled with increased glycolysis, hepatic dysfunction and immune dysfunction paired with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation, and interferon program suppression coupled with altered mitochondrial respiration. A fourth molecular signature, not associated with inflammatory phenotype, identified redox impairment and cell proliferation pathways associated with mortality. Integrated multi-omics analysis within each inflammatory phenotype revealed distinct pathways associated with mortality. All mortality-associated molecular signatures including those within phenotypes were validated in an independent cohort of critically ill patients with sepsis (EARLI). These findings reveal distinct molecular mechanisms underlying ARDS/sepsis phenotypes and suggest potential therapeutic targets for precise treatment strategies in critical illness."
40962609,Quantitative Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Assessment of Renal Microcirculation and Function in a Rat Model of Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.,2025,"PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the utility of quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in both assessing renal perfusion and monitoring renal function in a rat model of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI). METHODS: Thirty-six healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sepsis model group (with severe and mild subgroups) and a sham-operated control group (Sham). The model subgroups underwent cecal ligation and puncture to induce S-AKI, while the Sham group received only a laparotomy without ligation or puncture. Jugular venous blood was collected to measure serum creatinine (Scr) and uric acid (UA) levels. CEUS was performed to evaluate renal perfusion and time-intensity curves were analyzed to derive perfusion parameters. The relationships between these CEUS-derived parameters and the serum biomarkers were examined. Finally, kidney tissue samples were harvested for pathological analysis to confirm AKI. RESULTS: In the sepsis model rats, the time-based perfusion parameters-time to peak (TTP), rise time (RT), fall half-time (FHT) and mean transit time (MTT)-were all significantly longer than in the Sham group (all p < 0.05). Scr and UA levels correlated positively with TTP, MTT, RT and FHT (Scr: r = 0.695, 0.669, 0.704, 0.394; UA: r = 0.810, 0.798, 0.586, 0.351; all p < 0.05). Histopathological examination of renal tissues in the model subgroups revealed changes consistent with AKI, with the severe subgroup exhibiting more pronounced renal damage than the mild subgroup. CONCLUSION: Quantitative CEUS can effectively evaluate renal perfusion in rats with S-AKI and is valuable for detecting and monitoring changes in renal function."
40962454,Identification and Validation of Mitochondria-Related Genes for Diagnosis of Early-Stage Sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with unclear pathogenesis and limited effective treatments. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key factor in sepsis-induced multiple organ failure. This study aimed to identify essential mitochondria-related genes associated with sepsis to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies. METHODS: High-throughput gene expression data (GSE185263) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 348 septic patients and 44 healthy controls. Mitochondria-related DEGs were screened using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Two machine-learning algorithms, LASSO and SVM-RFE, were applied to identify mitochondria-associated hub genes. RESULTS: We identified 548 DEGs and screened 18 mitochondria-related DEGs. LASSO and SVM-RFE analyses identified 11 genes associated with sepsis diagnosis, showing strong diagnostic abilities through ROC assays. The expression of these 11 genes was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in septic patients and healthy participants, and differential expression of arginase 2 (ARG2), B-cell lymphoma 2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1), interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3 (NDUFB3), stomatin (STOM), and translocator protein (TSPO) were observed. Some gene expression differences remained significant after adjusting for neutrophil and platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in sepsis progression, and the identified genes may serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes."
40961458,The value of plasma presepsin as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for febrile neutropenia in children.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a prevalent infectious complication in paediatric cancer patients undergoing anticancer treatment. Presepsin is a reliable biomarker for sepsis; however, its clinical value in the context of paediatric FN remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of presepsin in the entire course of paediatric patients with FN. METHODS: In this prospective study, 108 paediatric patients with haematological tumours complicated with neutropenia were recruited, of whom 23 had febrile neutropenia. Blood samples were collected daily, and four inflammation biomarkers, presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected, and the diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers for FN was assessed. RESULTS: The concentrations of presepsin, PCT, IL-6 and CRP were prospectively measured in 57 FN episodes in 23 cases of malignant haematological diseases in children. The concentrations of presepsin, PCT and CRP were significantly elevated 72 h before onset compared to those in the control group. Only the concentration of presepsin at FN onset was significantly higher than 72 h before FN onset. The area under the curve (AUC) of presepsin, PCT, IL-6 and CRP for FN diagnosis 24 h before FN onset were 0.9118, 0.8214, 0.9052 and 0.8286, respectively. For prognosis, the levels of presepsin were consistently and significantly higher at every time point in patients with unfavourable outcomes than in those with favourable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Presepsin demonstrated the best performance in both the early diagnosis and prognosis assessment of FN, indicating that it is a reliable biomarker for managing the entire FN process. Close monitoring of presepsin may enable earlier intervention for FN, reducing the occurrence of adverse events caused by infection."
40961382,"Hemodynamic Changes, Organ Dysfunction, and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Sepsis-Induced Myocardial Dysfunction.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the hemodynamic changes associated with sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), assess its impact on organ dysfunction, and evaluate its clinical outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of 170 patients with sepsis hospitalized at the First Hospital of Kunming were included and categorized into two groups: Group A (sepsis without myocardial dysfunction, n = 106) and Group B (SIMD, n = 64). The groups were compared with respect to hemodynamic parameters, organ dysfunction, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients in Group B were older and had higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores, central venous pressure, and dp/dt max, as well as elevated biomarker levels indicative of myocardial dysfunction, compared to those in Group A. The incidence of multiple organ dysfunction was significantly higher in Group B (all p < 0.05). Additionally, Group B exhibited prolonged mechanical ventilation duration, extended intensive care unit stays, and increased mortality rates. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II scores (at days 1 and 7), troponin I (TnI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as independent risk factors for septic shock in patients with SIMD. BNP demonstrated the highest area under the curve for predicting septic shock in this population, with an optimal cutoff value of 268 pg/mL (sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 80.2%, 95% CI 0.714-0.861). CONCLUSION: SIMD is associated with significant hemodynamic disturbances, increased respiratory dysfunction, prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and elevated mortality. BNP and cTnI levels were significantly elevated in patients with SIMD, indicating a heightened risk of septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction, leading to adverse clinical outcomes."
40961380,Blood transcriptome analysis reveals CTSB and ATP6V0D1 expression in circulating monocytes as potential biomarkers of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infections, leading to organ dysfunction and posing a critical threat to human health. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis, early diagnosis and clinical treatment efficacy remain unsatisfactory. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as potential biomarkers of sepsis. METHODS: Bulk RNA-seq was performed on PBMCs obtained from 20 patients with sepsis and 12 healthy individuals. Multiple bioinformatics tools were used to identify key genes and signaling pathways associated with sepsis progression. The hub genes were further externally validated by publicly available blood transcriptomic data and experimentally verified by immunocytofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis revealed 4,522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with sepsis (n = 20) compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified multiple gene modules closely related to sepsis, with the royal blue module exhibiting the most positive correlation with sepsis. Intersection analysis yielded 176 common genes between the royal blue module genes and DEGs. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed five hub genes (CTSB, CTSD, ATP6V0D1, UBE2D1, and ATP6V0C) associated with sepsis. Immune infiltration was dissected by single sample gene set enrichment analysis, revealing associations between hub genes and monocytes. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis and immunocytofluorescence assay confirmed the upregulation of CTSB and ATP6V0D1 in circulating monocytes. Notably, CTSB and ATP6V0D1 were significantly associated with 28-day mortality of sepsis patients in the external validation cohort (n = 479). CONCLUSION: This study identifies CTSB and ATP6V0D1 expression in circulating monocytes as potential biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for sepsis."
40961067,"Predictive value of SOFA, PCT, Lactate, qSOFA and their combinations for mortality in patients with sepsis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of death, necessitating early prediction of mortality risk. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the predictive efficacy of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and lactate-adjusted qSOFA (LqSOFA) for the risk of death in patients with sepsis. METHODS: According to PRISMA-DTA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI were searched (up to March 2025), and 29 studies were included (n = 41,469). A bivariate random-effects model was used to pool the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DeltaAUROC was compared using a random-effects model based on a paired-data design. Heterogeneity was evaluated by I(2) (>50%) and Cochrane's Q test. RESULTS: SOFA demonstrated superior predictive efficacy (AUROC = 0.819, 95% CI: 0.783-0.850; sensitivity = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71-0.82; specificity = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.67-0.79), significantly outperforming PCT (DeltaAUROC = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04-0.16), lactate (DeltaAUROC = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03-0.11), and qSOFA (DeltaAUROC = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05-0.11). LqSOFA (AUROC = 0.823, 95% CI: 0.787-0.854) demonstrated efficacy comparable to SOFA (DeltaAUROC = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.02-0.06) and significantly superior to qSOFA (DeltaAUROC = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.04-0.08), with a sensitivity of 0.46 (0.24-0.69) and specificity of 0.88 (0.80-0.93). Subgroup analyses revealed sustained high performance in both emergency department (ED) settings (AUROC = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79-0.85) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (AUROC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77-0.84). CONCLUSION: SOFA remains the optimal predictor of sepsis mortality risk. qSOFA demonstrates suboptimal overall predictive ability, whereas LqSOFA achieves comparable accuracy to SOFA by combining the advantages of lactate and qSOFA. Its high specificity may be valuable for rapid risk exclusion in resource-limited settings (ED/LMICs). Future studies should validate LqSOFA across diverse clinical settings and underrepresented LMIC regions and should integrate dynamic lactate clearance metrics."
40959673,"Prognostic Utility of Prothrombin Time-International Normalized Ratio, Interleukin-6, and High-Density Lipoprotein Levels in Patients With Severe Sepsis.",2025,"Background A foremost cause of mortality in intensive care units is sepsis, especially in resource-limited nations such as India, where delays in patient presentations and limited diagnostic facilities pose common challenges. While conventional severity scores such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) are helpful, the multiple assessments required and labor-intensive calculations create an impractical situation for some clinicians. Thus, an urgent need arises for reliable biomarkers that could be measured at admission for faster and better prognosis. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the combined prognostic potential of three biomarkers, each reflecting a key facet in sepsis pathophysiology: coagulation (prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR)), inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6)), and immunometabolism (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)). Methodology This prospective, observational study was conducted from July 2023 to March 2025 among 152 adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in Ajmer, India. Admission levels of PT-INR, IL-6, and HDL cholesterol were measured. Sepsis was diagnosed based on the Sepsis-3 criteria (SOFA score increase of >/=2 points). The prognostic utility of the biomarkers was assessed by correlating their admission levels with clinical severity scores (SOFA and APACHE II) and in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and binary logistic regression. Results Of the 152 patients enrolled, the in-hospital mortality rate was 38.8%. Non-survivors had significantly higher admission levels of IL-6 (104.87 +/- 28.45 pg/mL) and PT-INR (1.97 +/- 0.50) and significantly lower levels of HDL (34.89 +/- 8.85 mg/dL) compared to survivors. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that IL-6 was an exceptionally strong predictor of mortality, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.995, and 100% sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff of 75 pg/mL. PT-INR showed a moderate predictive ability (AUC = 0.606), while HDL was a weaker predictor (AUC = 0.405). A combined logistic regression model incorporating all three biomarkers showed superior prognostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.94. Conclusions The combined use of admission-day biomarkers reflecting inflammation (IL-6), coagulation (PT-INR), and immunometabolism (HDL) provides a powerful and synergistic tool for early risk stratification in severe sepsis. While each marker offers unique prognostic insights, the multi-marker approach demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to individual markers alone. Specifically, IL-6 emerged as a remarkably potent and accurate predictor of mortality in this high-acuity patient cohort. This multi-marker strategy is particularly valuable for improving early prognostication and guiding treatment decisions in resource-limited settings."
40959459,Single-Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Peripheral Blood Reveals B-Cell-Driven Signature Predictive of Acute Pancreatitis Severity.,2025,"Effective early prediction of acute pancreatitis (AP) severity remains an unmet clinical need due to limited molecular characterization of systemic immune responses. We performed integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with T- and B-cell receptor profiling on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AP patients (n = 7) at days 1, 3, and 7 after admission. Immune landscape analysis revealed marked inter-patient heterogeneity, with a distinct expansion of MZB1-expressing plasma cells that were strongly associated with complicated AP and recovery. Functional validation in an independent cohort (n = 14) confirmed disease-associated plasma cell markers, alongside altered serum immunoglobulin and cytokine profiles (n = 32). From these findings, we established a nine-gene B-cell-derived transcriptomic signature (S100A8, DUSP1, JUN, HBA2, FOS, CYBA, JUNB, S100A9, and WDR83OS) predictive of AP severity. This model demonstrated high discriminative performance in internal validation (n = 114; AUROC > 0.95, superior to standard clinical scoring systems), and sustained accuracy in external validation cohorts of AP (n = 87) and AP combined with non-AP sepsis (n = 174) for predicting persistent organ failure. Our study identifies a mechanistic and predictive role for MZB1(+) plasma cells in AP pathogenesis, offering a novel immune-based stratification strategy with potential for precision clinical management."
40959327,Role of Artificial Intelligence in Critical Care Medicine: A Literature Review.,2025,"The growing availability of complex healthcare data, combined with advances in computational methods, has opened new avenues for improving critical care. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate continuous, multimodal data streams, ranging from vital-sign waveforms to laboratory results and clinical notes that place a substantial cognitive burden on clinicians. In recent years, significant focus has emerged on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and the ICU. With an increase in interest and improvement in patient outcomes due to AI use in the ICU, there is a need for an updated summary of current evidence. This review highlights the growing promise of AI in several ICU domains. AI subdomains, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, have been shown to accurately predict patient deterioration events such as sepsis, organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) hours in advance. AI-driven image interpretation can enhance diagnostic accuracy in radiology and pathology, and continuous monitoring algorithms can reduce false alarms. In conclusion, AI shows promise for critical care by enabling earlier risk detection, personalized therapy, and optimized resource utilization."
40959054,"Sepsis-driven metabolic reprogramming shapes cancer immunotherapy efficacy, metastatic potential, and drug sensitivity.",2025,"Sepsis and cancer interact in a complex, bidirectional manner that significantly impacts patient prognosis, with metabolic reprogramming being a key factor. Sepsis-induced immune dysregulation and metabolic changes promote immunosuppression, tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to immunotherapy. Cancer patients, especially those on immunosuppressive therapies, are more vulnerable to sepsis, complicating treatment and worsening outcomes. An integrated approach combining immunotherapy, metabolic interventions, and antimicrobial strategies is essential, alongside identifying biomarkers for personalized care. Recent advancements emphasize the need to integrate molecular insights, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity analysis. This review explores how sepsis-driven metabolic reprogramming affects cancer immunotherapy and metastasis, providing a foundation for future integrated treatment strategies. Further research should focus on developing precise therapies that regulate metabolism, immunity, and the microbiome."
40957233,Circulating Extracellular Vesicle miR-150-5p as a biomarker for optimizing clinical management of sepsis and septic shock: A discovery and validation Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock remain major causes of mortality in surgical patients. The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly their microRNAs (miRNAs) content, has emerged as key players in the detection and understanding of these conditions. Thus, this study aimed to profile circulating plasma-derived EV-miRNAs in patients with sepsis and septic shock to identify differential biomarkers that can facilitate the management of these patients. METHODS: A multicentric study was conducted in 100 patients who were followed prospectively, 58 developed septic shock and 42 developed sepsis. EV-miRNAs were isolated and massively sequenced to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between groups. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating curves (ROC). Results were validated in an additional validation cohort. Furthermore, we compared our data with an external cohort of plasma miRNA data. RESULTS: Eighteen SDE (Statistically Differentially Expressed) EV-miRNAs were identified between the two groups of patients. Six EV-miRNAs had a good ability to detect septic shock. Low levels of hsa-miR-150-5p showed the best ability to detect septic shock (AUC: 0.852; 95 % CI: 0.75-0.96; p < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 86.96 % and a specificity of 78.72 %. hsa-miR-150-5p association with septic shock was validated and confirmed its presence in plasma via qPCR. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, hsa-miR-150-5p levels exhibit a significant differential expression between septic shock and sepsis patients. This biomarker may help in early risk stratification and guide clinical decisions in post-surgical sepsis management. Moreover, our findings suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in sepsis, although its use as a therapeutic target requires further investigation."
40956626,Endothelial STING and STAT1 mediate IFN-independent effects of IL-6 in an endotoxemia-induced model of shock.,2025,"Severe systemic inflammatory reactions, including sepsis, often lead to shock, organ failure, and death, in part through an acute release of cytokines that promote vascular dysfunction. However, little is known about the vascular endothelial signaling pathways regulating the transcriptional profile in failing organs. Our work focused on signaling downstream of IL-6, due to its clinical importance as a biomarker for disease severity and predictor of mortality. Here, we show that loss of endothelial expression of the IL-6 pathway inhibitor SOCS3 promoted a type I IFN-like (IFNI-like) gene signature in response to endotoxemia in mouse kidneys and brains. In cultured primary human endothelial cells, IL-6 induced transient IFNI-like gene expression in a noncanonical, IFN-independent fashion. We further show that STAT3, which we had previously demonstrated to control IL-6-driven endothelial barrier function, was dispensable for this activity. Instead, IL-6 promoted a transient increase in cytosolic mitochondrial DNA and required STAT1, cGAS, STING, and IRF1, -3, and -4. Inhibition of this pathway in endothelial cell-specific STING-KO mice or global STAT1-KO mice led to reduced the severity of the response to acute endotoxemic challenge and prevented expression of an endotoxin-induced IFNI-like gene signature. These results suggest that permeability and DNA-sensing responses are driven by parallel pathways downstream of this cytokine, provide potential insights into the complex response to acute inflammatory responses, and offer the possibility of novel therapeutic strategies for independently controlling the intracellular responses to IL-6 in order to tailor the inflammatory response."
40956430,Reprogramming immunity with itaconate: metabolic mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives.,2025,"Itaconate, a mitochondrial metabolite generated from cis-aconitate via IRG1 (ACOD1), has emerged as a key immunometabolic signal that links metabolic reprogramming with immune regulation. Beyond its origin in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, itaconate exemplifies how metabolic intermediates can reshape cell fate and function under stress and inflammation. Upon inflammatory stimulation, immune cells-particularly macrophages-undergo profound metabolic rewiring. Itaconate orchestrates this shift by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), accumulating succinate, activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant responses, and modulating glycolytic flux, thus balancing inflammatory output and oxidative stress. This review provides an integrative overview of itaconate biosynthesis, metabolic regulation, and functional mechanisms across diverse physiological and pathological contexts. Itaconate and its derivatives, such as 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), exhibit promising effects in preclinical models of sepsis, acute lung injury, autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE and RA), ischemia-reperfusion injury, infection (bacterial and viral), and cancer. These effects are closely linked to itaconate's capacity to reprogram immune metabolism and modulate signaling pathways such as NF-kappaB, NLRP3, and JAK/STAT. Importantly, recent findings suggest that itaconate not only modulates inflammation but also affects immune cell death pathways, ferroptosis susceptibility, and tumor immune evasion. These multifaceted roles make itaconate a potential metabolic checkpoint in the development of new therapeutic strategies. However, challenges such as metabolic instability, limited bioavailability, and potential off-target effects remain to be addressed. In summary, itaconate represents a powerful endogenous modulator of immunometabolism. Its therapeutic utility, as a direct drug, as a scaffold for derivative design, or as a biomarker for inflammation resolution, holds significant promise for treating inflammation-driven diseases through the lens of metabolic reprogramming. This review summarizes itaconate biosynthesis, its molecular mechanisms in health and disease, and recent advances across multiple conditions, providing a foundation for future immunometabolic therapies."
40955356,Comparative Evaluation of Clinical Large Language Models and Machine Learning to Predict Antimicrobial Resistance in Hospital-Onset Sepsis.,2025,"Approaches to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy are needed, especially in critically ill populations with prevalent antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While artificial intelligence shows promise in predicting AMR, scalable and generalizable prediction models are essential for broad clinical adoption. We utilized a publicly available clinical large language model (LLM), Gatortron, in comparison to traditional machine learning, to predict AMR and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-specific patterns within a hospital-onset sepsis cohort using electronic health record (EHR) data available at time of illness onset. EHR data from approximately 150,000 hospitalizations with a documented bacterial infection at a large tertiary care healthcare system between 2010 and 2023 were examined. Among 2,019 eligible hospital-onset sepsis encounters, an AMR pathogen was identified in 911 (45%) and MRSA was isolated in 234 (26%). LLMs outperformed traditional models in predicting MRSA, achieving an AUC of 0.73 compared to 0.66 for the best traditional ML model, with superior F1 scores (0.43 vs. 0.16 for ML). Negative predictive value for MRSA prediction using LLM was at least 90% across majority of infection presentations. The LLM's superior prediction using a relatively simplified feature set demonstrates the potential of leveraging EHR data for early resistance prediction, though further refinement is needed to enhance sensitivity and clinical applicability."
40953859,Automated sepsis prediction from unstructured electronic health records using natural language processing: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for predicting sepsis. However, challenges remain in integrating AI, natural language processing (NLP) and free text data to enhance sepsis diagnosis at emergency department (ED) triage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI in improving sepsis diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed data from 134 266 patients admitted to the ED and subsequently hospitalised between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2021. The data set comprised 10 variables and free-text triage comments, which underwent tokenisation and processing using a bag-of-words model. We evaluated four traditional NLP classifier models, including logistic regression, LightGBM, random forest and neural network. We also evaluated the performance of the BERT classifier. We used area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and area under the curve (AUC) as performance metrics. RESULTS: Random forest exhibited superior predictive performance with an AUPRC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.7668 to 0.8018) and an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.7842 to 0.8173). Using raw text, the BERT model achieved an AUPRC of 0.7542 (95% CI: 0.7418 to 0.7741) and AUC of 0.7735 (95% CI: 0.7628 to 0.8017) for sepsis prediction. Key variables included ED treatment time, patient age, arrival-to-treatment time, Australasian Triage Scale and visit type. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates AI, particularly random forest and BERT classifiers, for early sepsis detection in EDs using free-text patient concerns. CONCLUSION: Incorporating free text into machine learning improved diagnosis and identified missed cases, enhancing sepsis prediction in the ED with an AI-powered clinical decision support system. Large, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings."
40953683,"Use of apoptosis, oxidative stress and specific cardiovascular biomarkers to demonstrate myocardial damage in neonatal calves infected with different infectious agents.",2025,"In human medicine, there is evidence to suggest that myocarditis may be present in cases of diarrhea associated with various infectious agents. Nevertheless, the question of whether etiological agents cause myocardial damage in calves with diarrhea remains unanswered in the field of veterinary medicine. Based on this, we aimed to determine the presence of myocardial damage, cellular oxidative damage and apoptosis in calves with sepsis using high-sensitivity biomarkers. The study material consisted of 55 acute diarrheal calves and ten healthy controls. The diarrheic calf group consisted of rotavirus (n = 10), coronavirus (n = 10), cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) (n = 10), giardia lamblia (n = 10), and non-survivors (n = 15). Cardiac histopathology and immunohistochemical (Heat shock proteins 27 and caspase 3) analyses were performed on 15 calves that did not survive the study. In sepsis calves, high sensitivity cardiac troponin-I, fatty acid binding protein 3, creatine kinase myocardial band, L-lactate, and anion gap concentrations were significantly higher than in the control group. In the histopathological examination of the heart of the calves that did not survive, degenerative-necrotic, cellular damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular changes were observed, while immunohistochemical examination determined that oxidative damage and intense apoptosis occurred. In conclusion, the presence of myocardial damage in sepsis calves was confirmed by both histopathological and immunohistochemical techniques and serum cardiac specific biomarker concentration analyses. It was also shown that anion gap, bicarbonate, and L-lactate also contribute to the formation of myocardial damage."
40951224,Acute Cardiotoxicity Induced by 5-Fluorouracil Successfully Treated With Levosimendan: A Case Report.,2025,"Cardiotoxicity is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly presenting as chest pain or acute heart failure. We present the case of a 48-year-old woman with colon cancer who developed acute decompensated heart failure within 48 hours of completing her first cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy (5-FU, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin). Echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 28% and markedly elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (>14,700 pg/mL), confirming severe cardiac dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and received continuous levosimendan infusion at 0.1 microg/kg/minute for 24 hours, along with norepinephrine support. This treatment resulted in significant clinical improvement, normalization of cardiac biomarkers, as documented by serial laboratory tests, and full recovery of renal and cardiac function. Follow-up echocardiography showed improvement in LVEF to 50%. Other differential diagnoses, such as ischemic heart disease, sepsis, and myocarditis, were ruled out through clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. Although causality cannot be definitively established, this case highlights the potential utility of levosimendan in chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity, particularly in patients requiring inotropic support. Only limited case-based literature exists regarding its use in this context. The patient remained clinically stable and asymptomatic during four weeks of outpatient follow-up. Further clinical studies are warranted to establish evidence-based recommendations."
40951066,Advances in Data-Driven Early Warning Systems for Sepsis Recognition and Intervention in Emergency Care: A Systematic Review of Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Outcomes.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early recognition in the emergency department (ED) is crucial for reducing mortality. However, traditional ED sepsis screening tools (e.g., Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA)) often lack sensitivity for early detection. Machine learning (ML)-based early warning systems have been proposed to address this gap by analyzing complex clinical data in real time. To address this, we systematically reviewed studies (2015-2025) assessing ML-based sepsis warning systems in adult EDs. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Included studies reported diagnostic performance and/or clinical outcomes. Overall, a total of 11 studies (primarily retrospective, with a few prospective) were included. ML models using vital signs, laboratory results, and electronic health record (EHR) data demonstrated high discrimination for sepsis, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values often exceeding 0.80, and outperformed traditional scoring tools. Many provided earlier warnings, often two to four hours before sepsis was clinically recognized. Implementation studies showed that ML-based alerts expedited treatment; one multi-center system reduced time to antibiotics by ~1.8 hours when alerts were promptly addressed. Some reports noted reduced organ failure and mortality. However, evidence of improved patient outcomes remains inconsistent, likely due to study heterogeneity and limited prospective validation. ML-based early warning systems show strong potential for improving sepsis recognition and treatment in EDs. Further multi-center trials are needed to confirm their impact on outcomes and guide safe implementation."
40949835,A Practical Nomogram Based on RDW-CV for Predicting Clinical Outcome in Elderly Septic Patients.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The retrospective study established a prognostic nomogram based on red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) for elderly septic patients. METHODS: We analyzed 1997 critically ill patients admitted between December 2016 and June 2019, and 986 elderly septic patients were included in the study and stratified into survival and non-survival groups. Using machine learning-based feature importance analysis and multivariate logistic regression, we evaluated predictors of mortality in the elderly septic patients, with particular focus on RDW-CV. We constructed a nomogram incorporating RDW-CV to predict clinical outcomes in elderly septic patients and evaluated its performance. RESULTS: The mortality of 986 elderly sepsis patients was 27.48%. Importance analysis showed that RDW-CV demonstrated superior predictive value for mortality. The RDW-CV (17.22 +/-3.98%) in the non-survival group was significantly higher than that (15.30 +/-2.81%) in the survival group, p < 0.0001. The RDW-CV was used to predict the mortality of patients and the AUC was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.69). Multivariate logistic regression showed that mechanical ventilation, drug-resistant bacterial infection, hemofiltration, and RDW-CV independently influenced mortality, a predictive nomogram was developed based on a final model that included RDW-CV and other clinical indicators, the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.755 (95% CI: 0.714, 0.797), decision curve analyses (DCA) revealed superior net benefit of the nomogram across threshold probabilities of 0.30-1.00 in both derivation and validation cohorts. The calibration curve demonstrates strong agreement between the model's predicted probabilities and the validation cohort's predicted probabilities. CONCLUSION: Higher RDW-CV was found to have a significant association with mortality prediction, the nomogram based on RDW-CV with other clinical indicators could more accurately predict the clinical outcome of elderly septic patients, validation analysis confirmed the accuracy of the nomogram, the predictive model offered clinical applicability."
40949133,Investigating the feasibility of machine learning to guide personalized red blood cell (RBC) transfusion: analyzing the heterogeneity of RBC transfusion in septic patients with hemoglobin levels of 7-9 g/dL based on the causal forest model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study utilized the causal forest algorithm to explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects of low-dose red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on the 90-day survival rate of sepsis patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 7-9 g/dL to develop personalized transfusion strategies. METHODS: The data of patients the met the Sepsis-3 criteria with a minimum Hb level of 7-9 g/dL were obtained from the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III databases and divided into RBC transfusion and non-transfusion groups. Patients in both groups were paired using a propensity score matching analysis (PSM) after which a causal forest model was constructed using MIMIC-IV data. The model's accuracy was analyzed using out-of-bag data. Individual treatment effects (ITE) of MIMIC-III patients were predicted and categorized into four subgroups: Quantile1 to Quantile4, based on the effect size. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were established for each Quantile to determine the survival rates. RESULTS: The MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III database comprised 1,652 and 868 patients, with 826 (50%) and 434 (50%) in the RBC transfusion group, respectively, after PSM. The mean prediction coefficient estimated by the causal forest was 1.00 with a standard error of 0.57, while the differential forest prediction coefficient was 1.64 with a standard error of 0.48, demonstrating the model's ability to effectively identify differences in the impact of transfusion on survival rates among individuals. There was significant heterogeneity in the ITE among patients in the MIMIC-III validation cohort. Moreover, the ITE values were divided into Quantile1: -5.4% (-8.0%, -3.9%), Quantile2: -2.1% (-2.6%, -1.7%), Quantile3: -0.5% (-0.1%, +0.1%), and Quantile 4: +3.6% (+2.0%, +6.6%). The Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test demonstrated that the RBC transfusion decreased the survival of patients in Quantile1 (p < 0.001) and Quantile2 (p = 0.011) but increased the survival of patients in Quantile4 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RBC transfusions among sepsis patients with Hb levels of 7-9 g/dL exhibit heterogenous treatment effects, which reduces the mortality of patients with high ITE. Although the causal forest model can guide personalized transfusion in these cases, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings."
40947770,Molecular dynamics of the host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia in baboons.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the widespread availability of antibiotics. Novel pneumonia therapies and biomarkers are urgently needed to improve outcomes and advance personalized therapy. Using an established baboon model of S. pneumoniae pneumonia, we sought to characterize the temporal dynamics of pneumonia host responses to identify novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic molecular targets. METHODS: We performed whole blood transcriptomics, unbiased proteomics, and peripheral cytokine measurements serially in baboons inoculated with S. pneumoniae (n = 23) or saline (n = 10) and modeled the peripheral blood host response using principal components analysis and complex sparse logistic regression. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for pathway analysis. RESULTS: Inoculated animals developed characteristic signs and symptoms of pneumonia. A 39-gene signature was derived that classified S. pneumoniae infection with high accuracy (auROC 0.9 and 0.99 at 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, respectively). Similar performance was observed for 48-h biomarker signatures derived from peripheral blood plasma proteomic and cytokine measurements (both auROC >0.9). The gene signature retained strong diagnostic performance (auROC = 0.88) when transformed to human orthologs and applied to patients with acute respiratory illness (n = 34) or healthy controls (n = 20). Pathway analysis at 48 h identified down-regulation of mitophagy and glucocorticoid signaling in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: We report novel peripheral blood gene and protein expression signatures of S. pneumoniae pneumonia that could improve pneumonia diagnosis and found distinct pathways that may be amenable to modulation. Our findings illustrate how non-human primate models of bacterial pneumonia can successfully translate biomarker discoveries to patients."
40947330,"TIM-3, a potential target for sepsis therapy.",2025,"Immune dysregulation is one of the leading causes of mortality in patients with sepsis. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), a negative costimulatory molecule, is pivotal for immune regulation during sepsis. The effects of TIM-3 appear to be bidirectional: in the early stages of sepsis, upregulation of TIM-3 may help attenuate inflammation, whereas its sustained overexpression in later stages and ligand binding promotes immune apoptosis or exhaustion, which suppresses immune responses. Furthermore, TIM-3 synergizes with other immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., programmed cell death receptor-1), exacerbates immunosuppression, and increases the risk of secondary infections. Blocking the TIM-3 signaling pathway can restore immune cell function and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis. Although TIM-3 holds promise as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target, its mechanisms are complex and may vary across disease stages, which necessitates further research to optimize targeted interventions. Future studies should focus on elucidating the dynamic signaling pathways of TIM-3, developing combination immunotherapies, and conducting clinical trials to validate its safety and efficacy in sepsis treatment."
40946819,Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang targets key monocyte-associated genes to enhance sepsis therapy.,2026,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition resulting from an uncontrolled immune response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and severe complications. Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (BZYQT), a traditional Chinese medicinal formulation, has been recognized for its diverse pharmacological effects, particularly in modulating immune responses and alleviating inflammation. However, the specific role and mechanism of BZYQT in the adjunctive treatment of sepsis are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of BZYQT in the adjunctive therapy of sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: scRNA-seq was employed to analyze PBMCs from patients with sepsis and healthy controls, identifying cell populations and functional states. Pseudotime and cell-cell communication analyses were conducted to investigate the origins and interactions of Sep_monocytes. hdWGCNA and machine learning techniques were utilized to identify key genes. The adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of BZYQT was assessed in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model, as well as in clinical trials. RESULTS: Seven populations of PBMCs and twelve subclusters of monocytes were identified, with two subclusters (Sep_monocytes) enriched in sepsis patients. Furthermore, critical gene modules were identified, with METTL9, SAT1, and SRGN being pinpointed as potential sepsis biomarkers. Notably, BZYQT was found to target these genes, modulating their expression. In the CLP mouse model, BZYQT administration (0.2 ml/10 g/d) in combination with imipenem/cilastatin (50 mg/kg/d) led to improved survival rates, significantly reduced bacterial loads, diminished inflammation, and enhanced antibacterial effects. Clinically, BZYQT alleviated symptoms, modulated immune cells, and reduced inflammatory markers, underscoring its potential efficacy as an adjunctive therapy for sepsis. CONCLUSION: BZYQT enhances sepsis therapy by targeting critical monocyte-associated genes, thereby modulating immune responses and reducing inflammation."
40946529,"Current challenges in understanding, diagnosing and managing sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.",2026,"Sepsis is a severe, life-threatening condition, which may be responsible for multiple complications, including cardiovascular events. Despite being a common complication, sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction (SICD) is still not entirely understood. This review underlines the diagnosis challenges, discusses the prognosis and proposes a diagnosis path for patients with suspected SICD. Existing severity scoring systems are not able or designed to predict the risk of cardiac dysfunction in septic patients. Current biomarkers are not sufficient for the diagnosis of SICD, only for the exclusion of acute myocardial infarction. Troponin levels may be negative or slightly elevated in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and natriuretic peptides are significantly more elevated in septic patients who develop cardiac dysfunction. Electrocardiogram changes are not always present. However, ischemic ST-T changes might be observed. Furthermore, sepsis is a risk factor for developing new-onset atrial fibrillation. Repeat echocardiography remains the crucial diagnosis method used to describe this reversible cardiac disorder. Acute cardiac dysfunction in septic patients requires a differential diagnosis between acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, Takotsubo Syndrome and SICD. A combination of clinical, biochemical or imaging data is not yet validated for diagnosing SICD."
40944790,MAO-A inhibition alleviates sepsis-driven lung injury via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation and suppression of pyroptosis.,2025,"Extensive research has highlighted the involvement of excessive oxidative stress and pyroptosis in sepsis-caused acute lung injury (ALI). The present investigation delves into the potential role of Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in this pathological process. Analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets alongside clinical samples revealed a significant upregulation of MAO-A in sepsis patients. To further elucidate this, cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced ALI were established in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, human alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) treated with MAO-A inhibitor RO11-11639 were subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro. The in-vivo experiments demonstrated that RO11-11639 mitigated CLP-induced ALI, significantly reducing pulmonary oxidative stress, inflammation and pyroptosis in lung tissue. Biochemical quantification revealed significant suppression of both oxidative stress biomarkers reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and key inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-16. Consistent with these findings, the in-vitro model confirmed that RO11-11639 reduced ROS and MDA accumulation, and inflammation in HPAEpiC, in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, functional rescue analysis delineated the nuclear factor erythropoietin-2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway as the critical mediator of RO11-11639's dual antioxidant and anti-pyroptosis activities in HPAEpiC. Mechanistically, MAO-A inhibition promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thereby activating the downstream regulatory proteins HO-1, quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) and glutathione s-transferase (CST). These data cumulatively indicate that pharmacological targeting of MAO-A may offer therapeutic benefits in septic ALI by attenuating pathophysiological processes involving oxidative damage and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis."
40944531,Clinical Implications of Systemic Corticosteroid Treatment on Mortality and Surgical Outcomes in Patients with Gastrointestinal Perforation: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025,"Background: Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used in critically ill patients. Although steroids may reduce the duration of shock and mechanical ventilation (MV), their use in postoperative surgical patients raises concerns regarding complications such as anastomotic leakage, impaired wound healing, and infection. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of postoperative corticosteroid therapy on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal perforation and receiving intensive care. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 354 patients treated between January 2013 and March 2023. Postoperative corticosteroid use was identified, and clinical outcomes were compared between treated and untreated patients. To reduce confounding, propensity score matching was performed based on initial and postoperative sequential organ failure assessment scores and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. A generalized linear model and a random forest (RF) regression model were applied to explore associations between steroid-related variables and the duration of MV. Results: Of the 354 patients, 37 (10.5%) received corticosteroids. In the unmatched cohort, the steroid group had higher mortality and complication rates. These differences were not significant after matching. In the matched cohort, the steroid group showed longer MV duration. No steroid-related variable was significantly associated with ventilation duration in regression analysis. Total hydrocortisone-equivalent dose emerged as the strongest predictor of prolonged MV duration in the RF model. Conclusion: Postoperative systemic corticosteroid therapy was independently associated with prolonged MV without adversely affecting mortality or overall morbidity. Although parametric analyses did not confirm a clear dose-response relationship, cumulative steroid dose demonstrated the highest predictive importance for ventilator dependence in machine learning modeling."
40943814,The Fibrinolytic System in Bacterial Sepsis: A Comprehensive Review of Current Assessment Methods.,2025,"Background: Fibrinolytic impairment is one of the key factors involved in the pathogenesis of hemostasis disturbances in sepsis, significantly contributing to microthrombosis, organ dysfunction, and mortality rates. While hemostatic assessment in sepsis typically focuses on coagulation activation, evaluating fibrinolytic activity remains challenging due to methodological limitations and a lack of standardization of the currently available methods. Objectives: This comprehensive review examines current methods for assessing fibrinolytic activity in bacterial sepsis, their clinical applications, strengths and limitations, and future perspectives for improved diagnostic approaches. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and identified 52 studies that investigated fibrinolysis assessment in adult patients with bacterial sepsis using biomarkers or global tests. Studies included mainly observational cohorts examining various fibrinolytic assessment methods. Results: Fibrinolytic shutdown, primarily mediated by the overproduction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), occurs early in sepsis and correlates with disease severity and mortality. Current assessment methods include plasma biomarker measurements (PAI-1, plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, D-dimer), global plasma-based tests (clot lysis time, plasmin generation assays), and whole-blood viscoelastic testing (rotational thromboelastometry, ROTEM; thromboelastography, TEG). Modified viscoelastic tests incorporating tissue plasminogen activators demonstrate enhanced sensitivity for detecting fibrinolytic resistance. Despite efforts, standardization is still limited, and routine clinical implementation has not been achieved yet. Conclusions: Fibrinolytic assessment provides important prognostic information in sepsis, despite methodological challenges. The integration of point-of-care viscoelastic testing with modified protocols shows promise for real-time evaluation. Future research should focus on developing standardized, automated assays suitable for routine clinical practice, enabling personalized therapeutic interventions that target fibrinolytic dysfunction in sepsis."
40941711,Is GDF15 a Feasible Biomarker in Sepsis?,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis is a high-mortality syndrome characterized by organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a stress-inducible cytokine, as a biomarker in patients diagnosed with urosepsis. Methods: A total of 13 patients diagnosed with urosepsis, based on an increase of >/=2 points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and positive urine culture, were included in the study. Daily blood samples were collected from patients for 10 days, and serum levels of GDF15, procalcitonin (PCT), and presepsin (P-SEP) were measured by ELISA. C-reactive protein (CRP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts were determined using autoanalyzers. Temporal changes were analyzed using the Friedman test, and correlations were analyzed using Spearman's test. Results: GDF15 levels began to decrease from Day 3, with a significant decline observed from Day 7 compared to Day 1 (p < 0.001). Similar decreasing trends were observed in CRP and PCT levels, whereas presepsin levels did not exhibit significant changes. Significant positive correlations were identified between GDF15 and CRP (r = 0.65, p = 0.015), BUN (r = 0.57, p = 0.041), and creatinine (r = 0.62, p = 0.024), and a significant negative correlation was observed with eGFR (r = -0.62, p = 0.024). No significant correlation was found between GDF15 and presepsin (p > 0.05). Conclusions: GDF15 is a biomarker sensitive to the resolution phase of inflammation and organ dysfunction in sepsis, demonstrating significant temporal changes. It holds potential as an indicator for monitoring clinical progression and assessing prognosis."
40941657,The Potential of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Sepsis: A Narrative Review.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis is a severe medical condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, with potentially fatal outcomes, requiring early diagnosis and rapid intervention. The limitations of traditional sepsis identification methods, as well as the complexity of clinical data generated in intensive care, have driven increased interest in applying artificial intelligence in this field. The aim of this narrative review article is to analyze how artificial intelligence is being used in the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis, to present the most relevant current models and algorithms, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities related to integrating these technologies into clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a structured literature search for this narrative review, covering studies published between 2016 and 2024 in databases such as PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The review covered models based on machine learning (ML), deep neural networks (DNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and clinical alert systems implemented in hospitals. The clinical data sources used, algorithms applied, system architectures, and performance outcomes are presented. Results: Numerous artificial intelligence models demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional clinical scores (qSOFA, SIRS), achieving AUC values above 0.90 in predicting sepsis and mortality. Systems such as Targeted Real-Time Early Warning System (TREWS) and InSight have been clinically validated and have significantly reduced the time to treatment initiation. However, challenges remain, such as a lack of model transparency, algorithmic bias, difficulties integrating into clinical workflows, and the absence of external validation in multicenter settings. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform sepsis management through early diagnosis, risk stratification, and personalized treatment. A responsible, multidisciplinary approach is necessary, including rigorous clinical validation, enhanced interpretability, and training of healthcare personnel to effectively integrate these technologies into everyday practice."
40937408,Association between sensitivity to thyroid hormone and prognosis in septic patients: a retrospective cohort analysis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is associated with significant endocrine dysfunction, particularly in thyroid hormone metabolism. This study aims to investigate the association between thyroid hormone sensitivity indices and prognosis in sepsis, exploring their potential as early prognostic markers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of sepsis patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University. Nonlinear associations between thyroid hormones (FT3, FT4, TSH), sensitivity indices (FT3/FT4, TFQI, PTFQI, TSHI, TT4RI), and sepsis mortality were assessed using restricted cubic spline models. Kaplan-Meier curves along with Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the longitudinal associations. K-means clustering was applied to thyroid hormone profiles to identify distinct phenotypes. RESULTS: Among 2,391 sepsis patients, non-survivors exhibited significantly lower levels of thyroid hormone and sensitivity indices compared to survivors. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a nonlinear dose-response relationship, with lower FT3, TFQI, PTFQI, TSHI, and TT4RI levels associated with increased mortality risk. Multiple Cox regression models identified FT3 (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, p = 0.001), TSH (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99, p = 0.004), TFQI (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.84, p < 0.001), PTFQI (HR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.37-0.61, p < 0.001), TSHI (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99, p = 0.040), and TT4RI (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, p = 0.001) as independent predictors of 90-day mortality. K-means clustering identified two distinct phenotypes, with Phenotype 2, characterized by profound thyroid hormone suppression and reduced sensitivity indices, was associated with a 36% higher mortality risk (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04-1.91, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Impaired thyroid hormone sensitivity are significantly associated with increased mortality in sepsis, emphasizing their potential as prognostic biomarkers and suggest their utility in risk stratification and personalized management of sepsis patients."
40937307,"Assessment of the Efficacy of Procalcitonin, C-Reactive Protein, and Albumin Levels-guided Antibiotics Use in Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Efficient management of sepsis requires precise antibiotic therapy. This study examines the efficacy of guiding such therapy using Procalcitonin (PCT), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and albumin levels. METHODS: A total of 127 adult sepsis patients were assigned to either standard care or a biomarker-guided group where antibiotic use was adjusted based on biomarker levels. RESULTS: The biomarker-guided approach significantly reduced the duration of antibiotic therapy (9.0 vs. 10.5 days, P=0.04) and expedited antibiotic de-escalation. Hospital costs were lower in the biomarker-guided group (20,000 vs. 24,000 CNY, P=0.04), though reductions in secondary infections did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy can enhance the efficiency of treatment in sepsis, reducing both duration and cost without impacting patient safety. These findings suggest the potential benefits of incorporating biomarkers into standard sepsis management protocols."
40935246,Metabolic Syndrome Develops Cardia Cancer via Nuclear Factor-E2-related Factor 2-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Signaling.,2026,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The incidence of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have increased concurrently. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may be a biomarker for GCA development and treatment resistance of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We aimed to elucidate whether high-fat diet (HFD)-related endotoxemia progresses GCA via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling. METHODS: We studied K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice fed HFD or control diet with or without systemic administration of Escherichia coli LPS +/- clodronate liposomes (CLs). To clarify the role of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in tumorigenesis, we generated Nrf2-deficient K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice. We performed further experiments using MKN7 and THP-1 cells. RESULTS: In the HFD + LPS group of K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice, tumor growth with increase in tumor cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration was observed with gut dysbiosis, gut mucosal barrier damage, endotoxemia, and insulin resistance. The expression of 8-OHdG, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa B (p-NFkappaB), and PD-L1 was upregulated in tumors. TNF-alpha expression was observed in tumor cells and stromal macrophages. These effects were abolished in the HFD + LPS + CL group. In the Nrf2-deficient K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice, tumors shrank as TNF-alpha and PD-L1 expression decreased, without improvement of gut barrier damage and endotoxemia. LPS stimulation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated THP-1 cells induced the expression of TNF-alpha, which activated NFkappaB-PD-L1 signaling in cocultured MKN7 cells. LPS stimulation of MKN7 cells increased the expression of NQO1, phosphorylated NFkappaB, and PD-L1, and NRF2 directly regulated CD274 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: HFD-related metabolic endotoxemia may promote GCA progression via PD-L1 induction in tumor cells directly through Nrf2 signaling activated by LPS and through NFkappaB signaling by TNF-alpha from LPS-activated macrophages in tumor microenvironment."
40930200,Plasma exosomes from viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus-infected olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus): Proteomic insights and wound healing effects.,2025,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) or their subtypes, such as exosomes, are valuable nano-biomolecules for immunotherapeutic, drug delivery, and diagnostic purposes. Freshwater and marine fish, including olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), are highly susceptible to the contagious Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). In this study, we aimed to determine how infection alters the biological responses by analyzing the proteomic profiles of plasma-derived exosomes from phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injected (PBS-Exo) and VHSV challenged (VHSV-Exo) olive flounders at the initial stages of infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that this immunomodulatory multifunctional biomaterial possesses wound-healing effects. To understand this, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass spectrometry approach was applied, and differentially expressed (DE) proteins in VHSV-Exo were identified. Following VHSV infection, a total of 2399 unique peptides with 407 proteins, including 27 upregulated and 25 downregulated (q < 0.05), were identified. Compared with mock-infected PBS-Exo, the DE proteome profile of VHSV-Exo is composed of various important biological processes related to metabolic, immune responses, and wound healing. A compiled set of proteins and pathways potentially associated with infection and pathology could be considered as early infectious biomarkers. Furthermore, VHSV-Exo exhibited a stronger wound healing effect than PBS-Exo both in vitro and in vivo. These results support our aim of demonstrating their multifunctional properties to improve fish health management and sustainable aquaculture practices."
40927774,Multi-Omics and Clinical Validation Identify Key Glycolysis- and Immune-Related Genes in Sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is characterized by profound immune and metabolic perturbations, with glycolysis serving as a pivotal modulator of immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms linking glycolytic reprogramming to immune dysfunction remain poorly defined. METHODS: Transcriptomic profiles of sepsis were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to glycolysis were identified through a combination of ssGSEA, WGCNA and differential expression analysis. Hub genes were prioritized using Mendelian randomization and machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, and Boruta), and validated in an independent dataset and by RT-qPCR in a clinical sepsis cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT to profile the immune landscape, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to delineate the cell type-specific transcriptional profiles. RESULTS: The ssGSEA scores derived from the glycolysis signature indicated a marked reduction in glycolytic activity associated with sepsis. By employing an integrative framework that includes WGCNA, differential expression analysis, Mendelian randomization, and machine learning algorithms, this study successfully identified five pivotal genes associated with glycolysis: DDX18, EIF3L, MAK16, THUMPD1, and ZNF260. The diminished expression of these genes was significantly correlated with immune remodeling, characterized by an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes. In a clinical sepsis cohort, RT-qPCR of peripheral blood, in conjunction with routine hematological profiling, validated their expression pattern and immune associations. Moreover, scRNA-seq facilitated a comprehensive characterization of these transcriptional alterations within distinct subsets of immune cells. CONCLUSION: This study identifies five glycolysis-related genes linked to immune remodeling in sepsis, revealing a metabolic-immune axis that may drives disease pathogenesis and offers promising targets for therapeutic intervention."
40927580,"Using molecular methods to diagnose, classify, and treat neonatal sepsis: a scoping review.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to bloodstream infection causing serious disease and death. Our review seeks to integrate the knowledge gained from studies of multiple molecular methods- such as genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and the gut microbiome- in the setting of neonatal sepsis that may improve the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of the disease. Sepsis claims over 200,000 lives annually worldwide and remains a top 10 cause of infant mortality in the US. Diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis remains a challenge as its mechanisms are poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of literature published between 2018 and 2024. Of 1,043 articles screened, 30 were included in the final review. RESULTS: The gut microbiome is associated with both pathogenicity and protection in the setting of neonatal sepsis, while expression levels of immune response and regulation help classify neonatal response to septic events. Metabolomic studies reveal possible biomarkers to detect, classify, and predict neonatal sepsis morbidity and mortality, and proteomic studies confirm mechanisms predicted by the other models. DISCUSSION: Studies using molecular methods foster greater understanding of neonatal sepsis and show promise to improve diagnosis, classification, and therapeutic intervention. Future research using multi-omic analyses may further elucidate the development and progression of inflammatory processes that occur as sepsis progresses."
40927447,Association between serum procalcitonin levels and outcomes of patients admitted to two tertiary paediatric intensive care units in Bloemfontein: A retrospective analytical study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) is used in the diagnosis of sepsis. Its capability as a prognostic marker is unclear. The association between PCT and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) outcomes has not been investigated in the South African setting. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between admission PCT, and trends within 72 hours of admission, and outcomes of patients admitted to the PICU at two tertiary academic hospitals. METHODS: The study was a two-year, double centre, retrospective, analytical cross-sectional medical record review. RESULTS: A total of 381 participants were included in the study; 55 died and 220 required mechanical ventilation. Non-survivors had a higher median admission PCT than survivors (p<0.0001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 - 15.12). Non-survivors had a higher median PCT at 48 - 72 hours than survivors (p<0.0001, 95% CI 2.50 - 21.72). Non-survivors had less of a median decrease in PCT than survivors (p=0.22, 95% CI -0.59 - 4.72). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) for admission PCT to discriminate for mortality was 0.6702 and for the 48 - 72 hour PCT it was 0.7369. There was a positive correlation between PCT and number of ventilator days (Spearman correlation co-efficient =0.1477, p=0.0138). There was no correlation between the length of PICU stay and admission PCT (p=0.7579) or PCT change (p=0.2034). CONCLUSION: Single PCT measurements display some ability to discriminate for PICU mortality. Serial PCT measurements provide greater prognostic information. Non-survivors had a significantly greater median admission PCT, median PCT at 48 - 72 hours and a lower median PCT decrease than survivors. CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY: This study clarifies the role and limitations of procalcitonin measurements and trends in PICU outcomes."
40926894,Serum S100A12 in the clinical diagnosis of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction: an integrated bioinformatics and clinical data analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a common and life-threatening syndrome in intensive care units, frequently accompanied by myocardial dysfunction, which significantly worsens patient outcomes. S100A12, a calcium-binding protein associated with inflammation, is upregulated in various inflammatory conditions. However, its role in sepsis and related cardiac injury remains unclear. METHODS: This study performed differential expression analysis using datasets from GEO to evaluate changes in S100A12 expression in sepsis and sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), followed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Patients diagnosed with sepsis were assigned into SIMD and non-SIMD groups, along with healthy controls. Serum S100A12 expression was evaluated by ELISA and RT-qPCR. Correlations with cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, and cardiac function indicators were assessed. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis showed upregulation of S100A12 in sepsis and SIMD, enriched in multiple inflammation-related pathways. Clinically, S100A12 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the SIMD group. There was a positive association between S100A12 concentrations and cTnI, CK-MB, PCT, and IL-6, whereas MAP and LVEF exhibited a negative correlation. Logistic regression identified S100A12 as an independent risk factor for SIMD. CONCLUSION: As an inflammatory biomarker, S100A12 has independent predictive value, and its combination with cardiac enzymes enables the development of an efficient clinical warning model. The study highlights a potential new biomarker and treatment focus that could aid in early detection and management of sepsis-related cardiac injury."
40926543,"Comprehensive Analysis of Gene Expression and Biomarkers in Sepsis Using Bioinformatics, Network Pharmacology and Molecular Modeling Approaches.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) have been known to provide important information on disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers a large reservoir of bioactive compounds that could modulate at these targets. This study is an attempt to investigate the biomarkers in Sepsis and COVID-19 using gene expression analysis and molecular modeling validation of TCM-derived candidate compounds targeting key DEGs associated with sepsis. METHODS: Gene expression data were obtained from NCBI, and limma package in R Studio was used to identify DEGs. Functional annotation was followed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were created using STRING, and key hub proteins identified utilizing Cytoscape. Molecular docking was conducted using 216 bioactive compounds obtained from TCM databases against target proteins. To study binding stability, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns were performed using GROMACS on top ranked protein-ligand complexes. RESULTS: A total of 432 key DEGs were functionally enriched in disease related pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identified the RRM2, AURKB, and CDK1 as hub proteins that could serve as promising therapeutic agents. Salvianolic Acid C, Hesperidin, and Gallocatechin Gallate were lead TCM compounds which showed strong binding affinity to these targets on the basis of molecular docking. Selected protein-ligand complexes were stable according to MD simulations. CONCLUSION: The current study indicates the possibility of TCM compounds to target DEGs crucial in sepsis pathology. The integrated bioinformatics approach establishes an approach to identify novel drug candidates, which need further experimental validation."
40925730,[Immunomodulatory therapy in severe pneumonia: a double-edged sword in determining clinical outcomes].,2025,"Severe pneumonia remains a major threat to human health, particularly in patients who progress to sepsis, with immune dysregulation playing a central role in its pathophysiological mechanism. Although immunomodulatory therapies have evolved alongside our improved understanding of immune imbalance, conflicting clinical evidence persists. For example, agents targeting similar pathways may produce divergent outcomes, while those with opposing mechanisms of action may yield comparable results. This heterogeneity likely stems from dynamic variations in the host's baseline status, pathogen type, disease stage, and therapeutic timing. Future breakthroughs will require a framework for precision immune profiling that integrates dynamic biomarker monitoring, metabolic modulation, and AI-assisted decision-making. The aim of such strategies is to achieve therapy that is tailored to the individual patient, optimized over time, and balances pathological suppression with host defense preservation. This will advance immunomodulatory therapies from empirical approaches to precision medicine paradigms."
40924914,"Monocyte Anisocytosis Can Discriminate Between Sepsis and Sterile Inflammation, but not Mortality, in Critically Ill Surgical/Trauma Patients: A Secondary Prospective Analysis.",2025,"OBJECTIVES BACKGROUND: Monocyte anisocytosis (monocyte distribution width [MDW]) has been previously validated to predict sepsis and outcome in patients presenting in the emergency department and mixed-population ICUs. Determining sepsis in a critically ill surgical/trauma population is often difficult due to concomitant inflammation and stress. We examined whether MDW could identify sepsis among patients admitted to a surgical/trauma ICU and predict clinical outcome. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of three prospective observational clinical studies. SETTING: Single institution ICU. PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Two hundred thirty-eight participants were included in this study: 107 patients who were admitted to the ICU and adjudicated to have sepsis, 80 patients who were considered critically ill nonseptic (CINS), and 51 healthy control participants. INTERVENTIONS: MDW was measured among hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of sepsis or CINS patients at risk of developing sepsis. Blood samples were collected at admission and at intervals during ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: MDW significantly differed between septic and CINS patients on ICU admission (26.4, interquartile range [IQR, 23.5-30.8] vs. 20.1 [IQR, 17.9-21.9]; p < 0.001) and could discriminate with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.91; p < 0.001). An MDW of greater than 22.0 at admission to the ICU could identify sepsis with a 78% specificity and a 90% sensitivity but could not discriminate in-hospital, 30-day, or 90-day mortality. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size from a single institution. Our analysis did not include other relevant biomarkers such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6. In the imputation of missing values, linear mixed-effect models were used, risking model misspecification and the violation of the missing-at-random assumption. CONCLUSIONS: Among surgical/trauma ICU patients, MDW can discriminate between sepsis and nonseptic inflammation, but it is a weak predictor of mortality."
40922986,A Web-Based Dynamic Nomogram for Early Diagnosis in Sepsis: Development and Validation with Real-World Clinical Utility.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis has high mortality and progresses rapidly, requiring early diagnosis; traditional scoring and lab parameters are limited in non-ICU settings, highlighting the need for biomarker integration and continuous monitoring to enhance diagnostic accuracy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1,098 patients at Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province identified sepsis and non-sepsis groups per Sepsis 3.0 criteria, Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the risk factors. A dynamic nomogram was built, and predictive accuracy was evaluated using calibration and decision curves. External validation for 94 patients occurred from January to March 2024, using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed eight independent risk factors significantly associated with sepsis development: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6278, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2079-2.1937), renal insufficiency (OR=1.7002, 95% CI, 1.2840-2.2513), cardiac insufficiency (OR=1.8927, 95% CI, 1.2979-2.7599), interleukin-6 levels (OR=1.0003 95% CI, 1.0002-1.0005), basophil percentage (OR=0.4319, 95% CI, 0.2353-0.7926), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (OR=1.0025, 95% CI, 1.0011-1.0040), platelet count (PLT) (OR=0.9939, 95% CI, 0.9912-0.9959) and D-dimer levels (OR=1.0796, 95% CI, 1.0273-1.1347). The prognostic nomogram showed significant discriminative power, with a concordance index of 0.746 (95% CI 0.709-0.772). ROC analysis further revealed a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.832 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.511. Decision curve analysis validated the clinical utility of the model, demonstrating a substantial net benefit for predicting disease progression within a clinically relevant probability threshold range of 30% - 70%. The model maintained satisfactory discriminative performance in external validation, demonstrating an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.663 (95% CI, 0.549-0.776). The interactive web-based nomogram is available at https://bixiaojie-1987.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/. CONCLUSION: This web-based dynamic nomogram incorporating eight clinically readily available predictors demonstrates robust diagnostic performance for sepsis, which helps doctors make quicker decisions by providing real-time risk assessments for each patient in non-ICU departments."
40920214,A Rapid Electrochemical Immunosensor Platform for the Sepsis-Associated Host and Pathogen Marker Dual Detection.,2025,"The study addresses the critical issue of sepsis diagnosis, a life-threatening condition triggered by the body's immune response to infection that leads to mortality. Current diagnostic methods rely on the time-consuming assessment of multiple biomarkers by a series of tests, leading to delayed treatment. Here, we report a platform for developing a point-of-care (POC) device utilizing electrochemical immunosensors for the dual and rapid detection of sepsis biomarkers: Procalcitonin (PCT), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as host markers and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a pathogen marker. The platform employs 3D microgels that encapsulate the electrochemically active nanoprobes (Carbon dots) for bacterial detection in a lower sample volume (10 muL) and reduced detection time to 10 min, significantly faster than conventional ELISA tests (4-5 h). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) techniques were used to assess the electrochemical characterization of biofunctionalized screen printed electrodes (bSPE) and sensor performance, respectively, showing improved sensitivity compared to standard ELISA tests. The developed sensor offers a lower limit of detection (LOD of 3.4 pg/mL for IL-6, 4.36 pg/mL for PCT, and 5.9 pg/mL for CRP) than commercial spectrophotometric ELISA, making it a promising alternative for accurate and timely sepsis diagnosis. Thus, the developed platform could revolutionize sepsis management by enabling early detection and treatment, potentially saving lives."
40918250,Microbial diversity and composition in the gut microbiome of patients during systemic inflammatory response syndrome: can we use gut bacteria as potential biomarkers to characterize sepsis?,2025,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients, including those with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, frequently exhibit gut microbiota disruption due to physiological stress and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy (AT). Although antibiotics are essential for controlling infection, they can destabilize the gut microbiota and may contribute to poorer clinical outcomes. The characterization of the gut microbiota of these patients may inform microbiota-based interventions to mitigate antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify key bacterial taxa that distinguish sepsis from non-sepsis patients. METHODS: A total of 89 stool samples (51 non-sepsis, 38 sepsis) were evaluated by amplicon sequencing the 16S rRNA gene to assess microbiota diversity and differential abundance. Samples were stratified by antibiotic exposure time: early AT (within 5th days of initiation) and prolonged AT (6th to 10th days). Additionally, patients were also grouped based on their AT: beta-lactam combined with other antimicrobial classes (BL-combined) and beta-lactam monotherapy (BL). RESULTS: During early AT, alpha diversity (Shannon index) was significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to non-sepsis patients (2.48 vs. 3.0, p = 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed after prolonged treatment (2.65 vs. 2.89, p = 0.58). Beta diversity analysis (Aitchison distance) revealed significant differences between groups early AT (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005), but not in the later phase (p = 0.54), suggesting that microbial communities converge over time. Early AT taxonomic profiling showed a decrease in Anaerobutyricum spp. and an increase in Holdemania spp. in the sepsis group. In the non-sepsis group, Veillonella spp. was impacted by time and beta-lactam combination. Turicibacter spp. showed a reduction in the prolonged AT sepsis group, while Klebsiella spp. was more abundant in the BL-combined sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis and non-sepsis patients showed distinct gut microbiota profiles in early AT. In sepsis, the loss of taxa involved in key metabolic functions, as short-chain fatty acid production, reflects dysbiosis and may contribute to worse outcomes. Prolonged antibiotic use may favor enteropathogen overgrowth and gut translocation. These findings highlight the potential of microbiota-based strategies to guide antimicrobial therapy and improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients."
40917940,Exploring the Potentials of Artificial Intelligence in Sepsis Management in the Intensive Care Unit.,2025,"Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, often detect sepsis after significant organ dysfunction has occurred, limiting the potential for early intervention. In this study, we reviewed how artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methodologies, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), can aid physicians. AI, in this case, particularly ML, processes massive amounts of real-time clinical data, vital signs, lab results, and patient history and can detect subtle patterns and predict sepsis earlier than traditional methods like SOFA or SIRS, which often lag behind after the presentation of the sequela. Models like random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks achieve high accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores (0.8-0.99) in ICU and emergency settings, enabling timely intervention by distinguishing sepsis from similar conditions despite the lack of perfect biomarkers. In practice, however, there are several potential pitfalls. Algorithmic bias due to nonrepresentative data, data fragmentation, lack of validation, and explainability issues are current barriers in developed models. Future research should address these limitations and develop more sophisticated models."
40914836,Screening of Relevant Genes and Signalling Pathways Affecting Adult Urosepsis: A Bioinformatic Analysis.,2025,"PURPOSE: The cellular and molecular pathophysiology of urosepsis, a condition caused by a urinary tract infection spreading to the bloodstream, involves complex epigenetic behavior. The objective of this study was to identify relevant genes and signaling pathways in adult urosepsis through a bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in silico study, the GSE69528 dataset, containing 138 total RNA blood samples from patients with sepsis and uninfected controls, was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Microarray data were analyzed using GEO2R tools and R software. DEGs were identified using a fold change (FC) cutoff of > 1.5 or < 0.67 and a significance level of p < 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used to determine the enriched pathways of DEGs before constructing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with STRING and Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total of 108 DEGs were identified, comprising 67 upregulated and 41 downregulated genes. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways such as the complement and coagulation cascade, neutrophil degranulation, negative regulation of interferon-gamma response, T-cell activation, and granulocyte differentiation. The PPI network analysis identified 67 nodes with 110 interactions, from which CEACAM8, MPO, and RETN were identified as hub genes. Overexpression of CEACAM8 and MPO and suppression of RETN may be associated with a better disease prognosis. CONCLUSION: The identified hub genes-CEACAM8, MPO, and RETN-are predicted to be significant biomarkers in the prognosis and progression of sepsis. These genes could be targeted for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs for treating and managing urosepsis."
40911033,Serum albumin demonstrates comparable or superior prognostic value compared to albumin-based ratios in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Serum albumin is a well-known biomarker in sepsis, and several albumin-based ratios have been proposed to enhance its prognostic performance. However, it remains unclear whether these composite indices outperform serum albumin alone in predicting outcomes in septic patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study including 413 adult patients with sepsis admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit of Santorso Hospital, Italy, between January 2023 and June 2024. Clinical data, laboratory parameters, and six albumin-based ratios were collected at admission. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Prognostic performance was assessed using ROC curves, Brier Scores, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Correlation with clinical severity was evaluated using Spearman's correlation with SOFA and APACHE II scores. RESULTS: Among the 413 patients enrolled, 30-day mortality was 16.9%. Serum albumin demonstrated the highest predictive value compared to all albumin-based ratios. DCA confirmed the superior net clinical benefit of serum albumin across a wide range of threshold probabilities, especially in early risk stratification. LAR showed comparable performance in AUC but lower clinical utility in DCA. Albumin also showed the strongest inverse correlation with SOFA (rho = -0.276, p < 0.001) and APACHE II (rho = -0.391, p < 0.001) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin is a strong, independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis and outperforms multiple albumin-based ratios in both statistical and clinical utility. Its use in early risk stratification should be encouraged in clinical practice. Further multicenter studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore their generalizability."
40910658,Optimal duration of antifungal therapy in candidemia.,2025,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In candidemia, the standard 14-day antifungal treatment after blood culture clearance has been long accepted, despite being based on limited and outdated evidence. This review discusses the rationale for re-evaluating treatment duration, in the context of growing interest in optimizing antifungal use. RECENT FINDINGS: A small number of retrospective studies have explored shorter treatment courses in uncomplicated candidemia, suggesting similar outcomes in terms of mortality and recurrence compared to the traditional 14-day regimen. However, these data are limited and potentially biased, with no randomized controlled trials available to provide definitive guidance. Moreover, no validated clinical, microbiological, or biomarker-based algorithms currently exist to inform individualized treatment duration in daily practice. SUMMARY: The historical 14-day rule for candidemia treatment is increasingly challenged by recent literature, yet the available evidence remains scarce and methodologically limited. A well designed randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to establish the efficacy and safety of shorter antifungal courses. These data would be essential to inform clinical decisions and support antifungal stewardship by minimizing unnecessary treatments, lowering costs, limiting resistance, and improving patient outcomes."
40909819,Diagnosing Sepsis Through Proteomic Insights: Findings from a Prospective ICU Cohort.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis diagnosis remains clinical and heterogeneous. We hypothesized that a proteomics-informed machine-learning approach could identify a small, easy-to-use, and optimized set of clinical variables to complement or potentially outperform SOFA. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study in an academic intensive care unit. Plasma from critically ill patients with and without sepsis was analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Data were acquired with data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF) and processed using DIA-NN software. Differentially expressed proteins informed model development. Random Forest models were trained in a Discovery cohort (n=55) to select clinical variables linked to the proteome, then tested in an independent Validation cohort (n=59). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) identified a minimal feature set that was predictive of sepsis. The performance was assessed using repeated cross-validation and external validation. RESULTS: Twelve plasma proteins differed between sepsis and non-sepsis patients at FDR < 0.1, corresponding to 26 proteome-enriched clinical variables. The classifier achieved mean AUC's of 0.73 and 0.76 in Discovery and Validation cohorts, respectively. RFE performance plateaued with >/=9 variables, peaked at an accuracy of 0.78, and deteriorated below seven; the final three features before collapse were plasma BUN, chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), and creatinine. Proteome-to-clinical regression highlighted creatinine as having the strongest correlation (R(2) = 0.558). DISCUSSION: A concise set of routinely obtainable variables anchored by renal markers and CCL3 captured proteomic signals and discriminated sepsis across cohorts, supporting a ""proteomics-informed, clinic-first"" strategy for pragmatic EHR deployment.While larger multicenter studies are warranted, these findings suggest that renal dysfunction exerts a disproportionate influence on sepsis and that increased emphasis on kidney-related markers may improve both recognition and risk assessment."
40909455,Impact of bleeding and thrombosis on outcome of 945 COVID-19 VV-ECMO cases from a German registry.,2025,"Bleeding and thromboembolic events (BTE) increase the mortality of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The current analysis aimed to assess frequency and determinants of BTE according to their location and severity in a retrospective analysis of the German ECMO COVID-19 registry. Logistic regression was applied to identify factors influencing ICU survival as well as variables associated with risks of BTE. In total, 708 of 945 patients (75%) suffered from BTE. Overall, 1,348 events were registered, including 406 (30%) major bleeding and 258 (19%) major thromboembolic events. Most common major bleeding locations were intracranial (n = 133, 10%) and pulmonary bleeding (n = 116, 9%). In-ICU survival was 35, 46% without BTE and 22% with major bleeding (p < 0.05). In summary, major bleeding was a core outcome-determinant of COVID-19 ECMO mortality with intracranial major bleeding as the most devastating complication (OR: 5.3; CI: 2.9-9.9; p < 0.001). Neither major thromboembolism nor minor BTE impacted ICU-mortality. Potentially modifiable factors associated with major bleeding included prolonged duration of ECMO >14 days (OR: 2.9; CI 1.8-4.7; p < 0.001) and platelet counts <100.000/muL >/= 72 h (OR: 2.0; CI 1.1-3.6; p = 0.018). Hence, prevention, early recognition and treatment of major bleedings are key to increase the survival of COVID-19 ECMO. In this regard, our data indicate that the implementation of early weaning strategies to minimize duration of ECMO therapy and prevention of prolonged thrombocytopenia with platelet counts <100.000/mul >/= 72 h could decrease the risk of devastating bleeds and could ameliorate survival.

40909263,"Identification of sepsis biomarkers through glutamine metabolism-mediated immune regulation: a comprehensive analysis employing mendelian randomization, multi-omics integration, and machine learning.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a global health challenge associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Early diagnosis and treatment are challenging because of the limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of sepsis through an integrated multi-method approach. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using data on 1400 plasma metabolites, 731 immune cell phenotypes, and sepsis genome-wide association studies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data GSE167363 was used for cell annotation, differential expression analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), transcription factor activity prediction, and cellular pseudotime analysis. The hub genes were identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression using GSE236713. The predictive models were constructed using the CatBoost, XGBoost, and NGBoost algorithms based on the data from GSE236713 and GSE28750. SHapley Additive ex Planations (SHAP) was used to filter the key molecules, and their expressions were confirmed via RT-qPCR of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patients with sepsis and healthy controls. RESULTS: Two-step MR revealed that glutamine degradant mediated the causal relationship between SSC-A on HLA-DR + NK and sepsis. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed distinct variations in the composition of immune cell phenotypes in the control and sepsis groups. NK cells were associated with glutamine metabolism. GSEA illustrated the top 10 pathways positively and negatively correlated in NK cells with high vs. low glutamine metabolism. Transcription factor prediction revealed opposing transcription factor profiles for these NK cells subsets. NK cell cellular pseudotime plot and immune cell infiltration analysis results were displayed. The predictive models achieved AUCs of 0.95 (CatBoost), 0.80 (XGBoost), and 0.62 (NGBoost). SHAP analysis identified SRSF7, E2F2, RAB13, and S100A8 as key molecular of the model. RT-qPCR revealed decreased SRSF7 expression and increased RAB13, E2F2, and S100A8 expression in sepsis. CONCLUSION: SSC-A on HLA-DR + NK cells reduced the risk of sepsis by decreasing glutamine degradation. SRSF7, E2F2, RAB13, and S100A8 were identified as potential pathogenic biomarkers of sepsis."
40908529,"Sepsis-Associated Brain Dysfunction: Mechanisms, Clinical Insights, and Therapeutic Strategies.",2025,"Sepsis is a lethal clinical condition representing severe inflammation and immune suppression to pathogen or infection, leading to tissue damage or organ dysfunction. Hyper-inflammation and immune suppression cause a fatal, escalated Blood-Brain Barrier permeability, being a secondary response towards infection resulting in sepsis-associated brain dysfunction. These changes in the BBB lead to the brain's susceptibility to increased morbidity and mortality. An important mechanism of sepsis-associated brain dysfunction includes excessive activation of microglial cells, altered brain endothelial barrier function, and BBB dysfunction. Lipopolysaccharide, a bacterial cell wall component (endotoxin), by forming a complex through membrane- bound CD receptors on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, begins synthesizing anti- inflammatory agents for defense of the host, including nitric oxide, cytokines, chemokines, interleukins, and the complement system. Unrestrained endotoxemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines result in microglial as well as brain endothelial cell stimulation, downregulation of tight junctions, along with intense recruitment of leucocytes. Subsequent neuroinflammation, together with BBB dysfunction, aggravates brain pathology as well as worsens sepsis-associated brain dysfunction. The clinical demonstration includes mild (confusion and delirium) along with severe (cognitive impairment, coma, as well as sequel death). Different clinical neurophysiological evaluation parameters can be used for the quantification and important issues of the disorder, including SOFA, imaging methods, and the use of biomarkers associated with brain dysfunction. The present review addresses the mechanism, clinical examination, the long-term cognitive effects, and current treatment modalities for sepsis-associated brain dysfunction."
40907700,Decoding COVID-19: phenotypes and the pursuit of precision medicine.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The pursuit of personalized medicine has underscored the critical role of phenotypes and subphenotypes in biology and medicine. A growing body of literature has identified diverse phenotypic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 influenced by host and viral factors. OBJECTIVES: To assess and integrate current knowledge regarding the clinical, immunologic, and molecular phenotypes associated with COVID-19, highlighting their impact on disease management, the personalization of therapeutic strategies, and the advancement of clinical research. SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from 1 October 2024 to 5 August 2025 to identify relevant literature regarding phenotypes observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONTENT: Clinical phenotypes involve various demographic factors and comorbidities, vital sign trajectories, patterns of acute organ dysfunction, and variations in biomarkers, which may differ among viral variants. Immunologic phenotypes involve dysregulated cytokine responses, altered immune cell functions, disruptions in key signalling pathways, and variations in white blood cell ratios, often reflecting a pattern of immune suppression. Molecular phenotypes reflect variations in host polymorphisms involving interleukin-18 secretion, inflammasome formation, and human leucocyte antigen-DR isotype expression and alterations in leukocyte function which may persist beyond the acute phase of infection. Viral protein expression influences infectivity and transmissibility as well as disease severity and progression. IMPLICATIONS: Understanding the phenotypes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can assist in clinical management and prognostication, stratification of patient populations for clinical trials, and development of novel therapies targeting various immunologic and molecular factors to improve morbidity and mortality."
40907597,The predictive ability of blood-based biomarkers to detect bacteremia in hospitalized neonatal foals.,2025,"Early and accurate identification of septicemia in neonatal foals improves survival. In human medicine, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) aid in early bacteremia detection. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of these markers in conjunction with other clinical and hematological parameters in hospitalized foals < 5 days old to predict positive blood culture at admission and to distinguish between Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or polymicrobial bacteremia. A total of 391 foals with a complete blood count and aseptically obtained blood culture at admission were included. Physical exam and hematologic parameters, including white blood cell count (WBC) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), were incorporated into logistic regression models, with the area under the curve (AUC) used to assess predictive performance. Plasma cfDNA was measured via fluorometry. We found that plasma cfDNA, IgG, NLR, and WBC were independent predictors of bacteremia, and a composite model demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability to identify foals with a positive blood culture (AUC = 0.806). Additionally, plasma cfDNA, IgG, and neutrophil counts were independent predictors of Gram-negative bacteremia, and a composite model demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC = 0.807), and monocyte count and age predicted Gram-positive bacteremia with a composite model that demonstrated fair discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.67). Our findings demonstrate that NLR and plasma cfDNA are significantly altered in bacteremic foals. whereas the NMR and MLR do not differ significantly between groups. Combining these markers with other clinicopathologic variables may enable early identification and timely intervention in affected foals."
40906653,Validation of plasma microRNAs as biomarkers in sepsis associated acute kidney injury upon first clinical presentation reveals limited diagnostic and prognostic performance.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening response to an infection, often complicated by sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). Early recognition of SA-AKI is critical but challenged by the limited sensitivity of existing diagnostic markers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate key SA-AKI pathways, have shown diagnostic promise, yet their clinical utility in early SA-AKI recognition remains unexplored. Moreover, validation in relevant clinical settings and populations remains limited. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of miRNAs for early recognition of SA-AKI at emergency department (ED) presentation, and explore the generalizability of findings by including a cohort of intensive care urine (ICU) patients with more advanced disease. METHODS: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of prospectively collected data from patients admitted to the ED and ICU. We performed a thorough literature review to select twelve miRNAs, previously implicated in kidney injury and sepsis or SA-AKI. MiRNAs were extracted from plasma and quantified using qPCR with and normalization to the global mean. We measured plasma levels of selected miRNAs upon ED arrival in 193 acutely ill patients (no infection, n = 65; sepsis, n = 67; SA-AKI, n = 61), and 47 critically ill patients (sepsis, n = 18; SA-AKI, n = 29). Statistical analyses included logistic and Cox regression adjusted for clinical variables, with correlations assessed between miRNA levels and disease severity markers. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: MiR-21-5p (OR 2.28, 95% CI [1.40-3.73]; p < 0.01) and miR-16-5p (OR 0.74, 95% CI [0.59-0.93]; p = 0.01) levels were associated with SA-AKI at ED presentation. Furthermore, miR-21-5p was independently associated with 30-day mortality after adjusting for age, illness severity, and comorbidities (adjusted OR 2.30, 95% CI [1.38-3.86]; p < 0.01). Similarly, in the ICU cohort with more advanced sepsis, miR-21-5p was associated with SA-AKI (OR 3.48, 95% CI [1.27-9.53]; P = 0.02), achieving an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI [0.58-0.89]), although it was not associated with 30-day mortality in this cohort. CONCLUSION: We selected twelve miRNAs through literature review associated with kidney injury, sepsis or SA-AKI. Of these, only miR-21-5p was associated with SA-AKI and predicted 30-day mortality upon ED admission. This analysis effectively serves as a negative validation for most literature-derived miRNAs, challenging their clinical applicability identification of SA-AKI both at early presentation and in more advanced stages.

40905776,"Diagnostic values of TPT1 in patients with sepsis, septic shock and in non-infected controls: A single-center prospective observational cohort study in ICU patients.",2025,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the diagnostic value of tumor protein translationally-controlled 1 (TPT1) in patients with sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).MethodsThis single-center, prospectively planned observational study included 53 ICU patients with sepsis (30 with non-shock sepsis, 23 with septic shock) and 20 non-infected ICU controls. Plasma levels of TPT1, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on day 1 of ICU admission. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.ResultsTPT1 levels were associated with higher SOFA scores and serum creatinine levels (p < 0.01). TPT1 levels were consistently significantly higher in non-shock sepsis and septic shock patients than in non-infected controls (p < 0.001). On day 1, plasma TPT1 levels effectively differentiated non-shock from septic shock (p < 0.01). TPT1 has good diagnostic value for sepsis and septic shock (AUC 0.80 and 0.94, respectively, p < 0.0001). TPT1 levels were significantly elevated in both non-shock sepsis and septic shock groups compared to non-infected controls (p < 0.001). TPT1 also showed a positive correlation with SOFA score and serum creatinine (p < 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for TPT1 was 0.80 for sepsis and 0.94 for septic shock (p < 0.0001), indicating moderate to high diagnostic accuracy. TPT1 outperformed CRP and PCT in distinguishing septic shock from non-shock sepsis (AUC = 0.71).ConclusionsTPT1 has significant value as a diagnostic marker in sepsis and septic shock, with diagnostic capabilities comparable to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein."
40905195,A Longitudinal NMR-Based Metabolomics Highlights Shared Mechanisms of Pathophysiology in ARDS Patients With and Without Sepsis.,2025,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition often complicated by sepsis, leading to worse clinical outcomes. The role of biomarkers in distinguishing ARDS with and without sepsis remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in serum metabolites between the two groups, comparing levels on Day 1 and Day 7 of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and to assess the variation in outcomes via clinical characteristics. A cohort of n = 151 patients was included, with n = 91 providing serum samples on Day 1 and n = 60 on Day 7. Of the n = 91 patients on Day 1, n = 40 had ARDS with sepsis and n = 51 without sepsis, while on Day 7, n = 24 had ARDS with sepsis and n = 36 without. Serum samples were analyzed using (1)H NMR-based metabolomics to identify altered metabolites and perturbed pathways. In contrast, no significant differences were found between the patient groups with and without sepsis on either Day 1 or Day 7. Mortality rates were also similar in both groups, with a 50% survival rate on Day 7. No notable differences in the clinical data were observed. These findings suggest that ARDS, with and without sepsis, exhibits a similar metabolic profile, likely due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms. In light of these similarities, the findings indicate a unified approach to ARDS management that may improve the clinical outcomes across both groups."
40902875,Advances in therapeutic strategies for acute kidney injury.,2025,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a complex clinical syndrome marked by a rapid decline in renal function, most commonly triggered by ischemia, hypoxia, or nephrotoxic insults, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in understanding its underlying mechanisms, current treatments remain predominantly supportive, with no effective therapies available to reverse or repair renal damage. Although biomarker-guided precision medicine holds promise, its clinical utility requires further validation through large-scale trials. This review summarizes recent progress in AKI therapy, with a particular focus on injury induced by nephrotoxic drugs (cisplatin, aminoglycosides, contrast media), sepsis, and ischemia-reperfusion. It discusses innovative strategies including nanomedicine-based drug delivery, plant-derived therapeutics, ferroptosis inhibition, and gene or microRNA-targeted approaches, alongside emerging clinical interventions and assessment tools. By bridging experimental findings with clinical application, this review provides insight into evolving therapeutic avenues and emphasizes the ongoing need for targeted, effective interventions to improve outcomes in AKI."
40901592,Iron metabolism and sepsis-associated liver injury: Methodological considerations and clinical perspectives.,2025,"This letter offered commentary on the recently published article by Wang et al that investigated the relationship between iron metabolism disorders and sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI). The original study identified serum iron and total iron-binding capacity as potential predictive markers of SALI, contributing important insights to critical care hepatology. In this correspondence several methodological considerations that may influence the interpretation and generalizability of the findings were discussed. These include the limitations of a single-center design, the lack of serial biomarker measurements, the omission of hepcidin (a central iron regulatory hormone) as a measured variable, and the exclusive reliance on biochemical criteria for diagnosing liver injury. The potential value of incorporating imaging modalities and additional iron-related markers such as ferritin and transferrin saturation were also highlighted. The aim was to reinforce the importance of a comprehensive approach to iron metabolism in sepsis and to suggest future directions for clinical research that may enhance the diagnostic and prognostic utility of iron-related biomarkers in SALI."
40901476,Evaluation of whole blood CD64 for identifying infection in neonates receiving hospital care.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Infection remains one of the most common causes of death in neonates. However, early detection of neonatal infections to inform treatment decisions remains clinically and technically challenging due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, and the lack of a sufficiently accurate diagnostic test. Neonatal infections and sepsis in adults have been associated with increased CD64 expression on neutrophils. We investigated whole blood CD64 (wbCD64) and neutrophil elastase (NE) in neonates who were evaluated and treated for potential infection and evaluated the potential for these biomarkers as diagnostic tools. METHODS: Neonates were prospectively recruited from two neonatal units. Whole blood samples were collected at the time of clinical evaluation for potential infection, if antimicrobials were also initiated. Whole blood CD64 and NE, as a marker of the neutrophil count, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Correlations between wbCD64, NE, and standard hematologic indices were evaluated and diagnostic performance of wbCD64 in relation to infections analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Samples were analyzed from a total of 178 episodes of infection evaluation from 163 neonates. Whole blood CD64 and NE had a positive, non-linear correlation. Infection was diagnosed in 45% (80/178) of episodes, and 31% (55/178) had infection that was microbiologically confirmed. There was no association identified between wbCD64 and infections, and wbCD64 had poor diagnostic performance for infection detection. Evaluation of wbCD64 relative to levels of NE did not improve diagnostic performance. WbCD64 levels were significantly higher among a subgroup of neonates aged >48 hours who had microbiologically-confirmed bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI), with optimal sensitivity and specificity for BSI detection 53% and 87% respectively. CONCLUSION: WbCD64 is generally not significantly associated with infection in neonates, but shows some association with bacterial bloodstream infections. The diagnostic performance of wbCD64, with or without NE, does not afford sufficient diagnostic accuracy to aid antimicrobial therapeutic decisions for neonatal infections."
40901002,"Development and validation of web-based, interpretable predictive models for sepsis and mortality in extensive burns.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Burn injuries are a common cause of trauma globally, with extensive burns (>/= 50% total body surface area burned) associated with high rates of sepsis and mortality. This study aims to identify risk factors associated with sepsis and mortality in extensively burned patients and to develop accurate, interpretable predictive models via machine learning algorithms. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing data from two Burn Critical Care Units in Eastern China from 2012-2023. A total of 237 patients with extensive burns were included. We applied ten machine learning algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting tree (GBT), and logistic regression, to predict sepsis and mortality. The models were evaluated via AUC, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, and were compared with the SOFA score performance. Model interpretability was enhanced via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: The key predictive factors for sepsis included the SOFA score, new onset shock, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), third-degree burned area, TBSA burned, white blood cell count, and inhalation injury. For mortality, the key predictive factors included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the SOFA score, type of burn, new onset shock, third-degree burn area, TBSA burned, and sepsis. The RF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting sepsis (AUC = 0.977, accuracy = 0.945, recall = 0.964, precision = 0.930, and F1 score = 0.945). For mortality prediction, the GBT model yielded the highest AUC of 0.981 (accuracy = 0.952, recall = 0.965, precision = 0.942, and F1 score = 0.953). The sepsis prediction model outperformed the SOFA-based logistic regression model. Web-based calculators were developed to aid clinical decision-making. CONCLUSION: Machine learning models, RF and GBT, demonstrate strong predictive ability for sepsis and mortality in extensive burn patients. The application of SHAP enhances model transparency, facilitating clinical interpretation and early intervention. Two web-based calculators can guide intensive care strategies and improve patient outcomes."
40899738,Routine Laboratory Tests Predict 72-h Fatality in Patients With D-Dimer Levels >/= 2 mug/mL: A Retrospective Cohort Study Comparing Statistical and Machine Learning Models.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prognostic value of D-dimer in various clinical conditions, limited research has addressed short-term fatality prediction across disease categories. This study aimed to develop and compare models predicting 72-h fatality in patients with D-dimer levels >/= 2 mug/mL, using laboratory variables. This timeframe was chosen based on its clinical relevance for early triage and intervention across multiple acute conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 5158 patients (241 deaths within 72 h). The primary outcome was 72-h fatality; predictors included age, sex, and 40 routine hematologic, biochemical, and coagulation tests. Traditional multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was compared with four machine learning (ML) models: Prediction One, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. External validation was performed using a separate dataset of 5550 patients (309 deaths). D-dimer levels were recorded in any clinical setting despite limited patient medical information. RESULTS: The 72-h fatality rate increased with increasing D-dimer levels (overall 4.67%). Major causes of death were intracranial disease (24.9%), malignancy (17.0%), and sepsis (8.3%). MLRA identified five key predictors: advanced age, low total protein and cholesterol levels, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and D-dimer levels. Its performance (AUC 0.829, 95% CI 0.768-0.888; sensitivity 0.762; specificity 0.809) was exceeded by LightGBM (AUC 0.987; sensitivity 0.987; specificity 0.911), which outperformed Prediction One (0.814), XGBoost (0.981), and CatBoost (0.937). CONCLUSION: ML models, particularly LightGBM, effectively identify high-risk patients using routine laboratory tests. The model enables timely decision-making and early risk stratification in patients with high D-dimer values, even when clinical information is limited."
40899696,Early Dysregulation of Angiopoietin-1 and -2 as a Predictor of Mortality in Critically Ill Burn Patients.,2026,"Shock-induced endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in burn pathophysiology, with endothelial glycocalyx layer degradation promoting systemic inflammation, vascular instability, and multi-organ failure. The angiopoietin-tunica interna endothelial cell kinase (TIE2) axis, particularly the angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) balance, regulates endothelial function; elevated Ang-2 and a high Ang-2/1 ratio are linked to worse outcomes in critical illness. While well-documented in sepsis and trauma, effects of burn-induced angiopoietin dysregulation remain unclear. This study evaluates Ang-1, Ang-2, and the Ang-2/1 ratio as biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with burn injuries. In this prospective study, 62 adult patients with burn injuries were enrolled (January 2021-November 2024), with serum Ang-1 and Ang-2 measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on postburn day 1. Of 62 patients, 52 were analyzed; 78.05% of survivors and 90.91% of non-survivors were male. Median age was 45 (survivors) vs 54 years (non-survivors, P = .139). Non-survivors trended toward burns > 20% TBSA (72.73% vs 41.46%, P = .093). Ang-1 was lower in non-survivors (3.96 vs 7.97 ng/mL, P < .001), predicting early mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC]: 0.82) with a cut-off of 4.825 ng/mL and decreased mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.87, P = .017). Ang-2 was higher (6.07 vs 1.99 ng/mL, P < .001; AUROC: 0.95), with a cut-off of 3.554 ng/mL. The Ang-2/1 ratio was elevated (1.59 vs 0.23, P < .001; AUROC: 0.93), with a cut-off of 0.504 and increased mortality risk (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.10-5.12, P = .038). Early Ang-1, Ang-2, and Ang-2/1 ratio levels correlate with 30-day mortality and may guide early prognostication."
40898549,Meta-analysis of serum amyloid A for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis: A comprehensive evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis remains a major clinical challenge due to its high morbidity and mortality, necessitating reliable diagnostic markers for early detection. This meta-analysis evaluates the potential of serum amyloid A (SAA) as a diagnostic biomarker for neonatal sepsis, given its role in the acute inflammatory response. METHODS: Computerized searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) were conducted to collect relevant studies on the diagnostic role of SAA in neonatal sepsis. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment of studies were performed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and QUADAS standards. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0 and Meta-Disc 1.4 software. Stata 17.0 was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of included studies, and to draw forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves. The area under the SROC curve was calculated, and a funnel plot was constructed to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles, comprising 971 neonates with sepsis, were included. Meta-analysis results showed that the combined sensitivity and specificity of SAA in diagnosing neonatal sepsis were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79-0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.92), respectively. The combined positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 6.3 (95% CI: 3.6-10.9) and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.12-0.25), respectively, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 36 (95% CI: 16-79). The area under the curve of the SROC curve was 0.91, and the Deek funnel plot suggested no publication bias in the included studies. CONCLUSION: SAA has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing neonatal sepsis, providing important evidence for its treatment. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among different studies, and further high-quality prospective studies are needed to confirm its clinical applicability."
40898483,Identification and exploration of novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents for the progression of sepsis to septic ARDS.,2025,"Patients with sepsis complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) face a significantly increased risk of in-hospital death. This study aimed to identify sepsis-associated genes involved in ARDS pathogenesis and discover candidate biomarkers for its diagnosis. Gene expression profiling data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were analyzed to identify key septic ARDS genes using differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Functional enrichment and connectivity map analyses were performed to explore underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic drugs. Machine learning algorithms were applied to screen biomarkers and construct a diagnostic nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic, calibration, and decision curve analyses evaluated its diagnostic performance. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing were used to assess immune cell infiltration. We identified 49 key genes linked to septic ARDS, enriched in inflammatory response regulation, reactive oxygen biosynthesis, and immune suppression. Connectivity map analysis suggested etoposide as a potential ARDS treatment. Three hub genes, ATPase plasma membrane Ca2(+) transporting 1 (ATP2B1), retinol binding protein 7 (RBP7), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), were selected as candidate biomarkers for nomogram construction, demonstrating ideal diagnostic performance. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed immune downregulation in ARDS, with ATP2B1, RBP7, and AIM2 significantly associated with immune dysregulation. This study uncovered inflammatory immune pathways in ARDS and developed an ATP2B1/RBP7/AIM2-based nomogram for septic ARDS diagnosis, offering new insights for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions."
