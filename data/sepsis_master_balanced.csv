41567647,Preventive effect of small molecule active substances on septic cardiomyopathy after abdominal trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the preventive effects and mechanisms of active small molecules against septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) induced by abdominal trauma or abdominal-origin sepsis in animal models. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched in January 2000- May 2025 for studies assessing active small molecules in animal SCM models. The standardised mean difference ([SMD], Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to molecular categories, sepsis induction methods, and outcome measures. Methodological quality was assessed using the Systematic Review of Laboratory Animal Experiments risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled meta-analysis showed that active small molecules had an overall beneficial but heterogeneous effect on SCM (SMD = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.52-3.47, I(2) = 92.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed large but imprecise effects for polyphenols (SMD = 4.81, 95% CI: -5.25-14.87) and neutral effects for flavonoids (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -3.64-2.73). The efficacy was greater in lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis models (SMD = 2.86) compared with cecal ligation and puncture models (SMD = 0.16). Outcomes involving cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase and creatine kinase isozymes) showed consistently positive and robust effects, while functional outcomes (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction) exhibited inconsistent results. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness, while funnel plots indicated possible publication bias (Egger's test, p = 0.123). Methodological limitations, including incomplete reporting of randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment, were commonly observed. CONCLUSION: Active small molecules demonstrate generally positive yet heterogeneous preventive efficacy against SCM in animal models, with polyphenolic compounds in particular showing notable potential. Variability across molecular categories, sepsis models and measured outcomes highlights the need for standardised methodologies in future studies."
41561091,"Clinical and molecular features of candidemia: a three-year retrospective study in Northern Guizhou, China.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: Candidemia, a life-threatening infection with rising incidence and substantial mortality, necessitates improved management strategies. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features, species distribution, risk factors, antifungal susceptibility, and molecular epidemiology of Candida albicans isolates from candidemia patients over a three-year period. METHODS: This retrospective study included 133 patients with candidemia from a teaching hospital in Guizhou, China between December 2019 and November 2022. Clinical data were compared between C. albicans (n = 63) and non-C. albicans (NAC) (n = 70) groups. Risk factors and prognostic biomarkers were identified using logistic regression and ROC analysis. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for C. albicans isolates. RESULTS: NAC species predominated (52.6%) over C. albicans (47.4%). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 48.1%, higher in C. albicans infections. For C. albicans, hypoalbuminemia and septic shock were independent mortality risk factors, while antifungal therapy and higher platelets were protective. For NAC, septic shock and elevated serum urea were risk factors. Prognostic biomarkers included D-dimer and CRP for C. albicans, and serum urea and total bilirubin for NAC. Most isolates were antifungal-susceptible, though C. glabrata and C. tropicalis showed increased azole non-susceptibility. MLST of 48 C. albicans isolates identified 7 novel alleles and 23 new DST types. CC9 was the predominant clonal complex. CC138 and CC139 are newly reported clonal complexes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that candidemia remains a serious threat with high mortality. The distinct risk factors and prognostic biomarkers between C. albicans and non-C. albicans species indicate the need for species-specific management. Although overall resistance remains low, emerging azole non-susceptibility in key species underscores the necessity for continuous susceptibility surveillance. MLST revealed a highly diverse and evolving C. albicans population, including novel genetic lineages. Integrating molecular epidemiology with clinical data is crucial for advancing global candidemia management."
19949759,Venous catheter-associated bacteremia caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria at a medical center in central Taiwan.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are increasing worldwide, especially in immunocompromised hosts, but data on the clinical features of patients with RGM bacteremia are limited in Taiwan. This study was performed to determine the features associated with RGM. METHODS: The medical records of 12 patients with RGM bacteremia admitted to the Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, from April 2001 to March 2003 were retrospectively studied. Clinical data were reviewed and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of blood isolates by the agar disk elution method was performed. RESULTS: RGM bacteremia was caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum in 5 patients, Mycobacterium smegmatis in 3, Mycobacterium flavescens in 2, and Mycobacterium abscessus in 2. There were 5 men and 7 women (age range, 4-75 years). All patients had underlying diseases and all of the infections were associated with an indwelling vascular catheter. The time to onset of bacteremia ranged from 1 to 24 months. Fever (n = 11) was the most common presenting symptom. Susceptibility testing revealed a different antibiogram for each species of RGM. The rate of relapsing bacteremia was significantly higher in patients with delayed catheter removal and for whom the catheter was not removed (6/8; 75%) than in patients with timely catheter removal (0/4; 0%) [p = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: RGM bacteremia is rare but should be considered in immunocompromised patients with an indwelling venous catheter and undifferentiated fever. Identifying RGM at the species level and performing susceptibility testing are useful for guiding management. The catheter should be removed as soon as possible."
25681153,In vitro susceptibility and molecular characterization of Candida spp. from candidemic patients.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Candida species are the main cause of hospital acquired fungal bloodstream infections. The main risk factors for candidemia include parenteral nutrition, long-term intensive care, neutropenia, diabetes, abdominal surgery and the use of central venous catheters. The antifungal drugs used to treat candidemia are mainly the echinocandins, however some isolates may be resistant to these drugs. AIMS: This work aims to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility patterns of various Candida species isolated from blood samples and provide their identification by molecular characterization. METHODS: Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method. The sequencing of the ITS and D1/D2 regions of rDNA was used for molecular characterization. RESULTS: Seventy-four of the 80 isolates were susceptible to anidulafungin, 5 were intermediate, and 1 was resistant. For micafungin 67 were susceptible, 8 were intermediate and 5 were resistant. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. Lastly, 65 isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, 8 were dose-dependent and 4 were resistant. The molecular identification corroborated the phenotypic data in 91.3% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Antifungal susceptibility data has an important role in the treatment of candidemia episodes. It was also concluded that the molecular analysis of isolates provides an accurate identification and identifies genetic variability within Candida species isolated from patients with candidemia."
41446870,From Defense to Dysfunction: Decoding the Paradox of Emergency Granulopoiesis in Sepsis Pathogenesis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by dysregulated host response that culminates in organ dysfunction. Recognizing that many prior reviews treated neutrophils as largely homogeneous or discussed their functions in isolation, we present a framework centered on emergency granulopoiesis that unifies groundbreaking single-cell multi-omics discoveries, bone marrow niche remodeling, and bedside biomarkers such as the immature-to-total neutrophil ratio and sepsis endotypes to explain the shift from defense to dysfunction. As a hallmark adaptation, emergency granulopoiesis rapidly replenishes neutrophils but paradoxically yields immature neutrophils with impaired chemotaxis, excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis)/reactive oxygen species, and immunosuppressive activity that aggravate tissue damage, organ failure, and late immunoparalysis. We synthesize subset-level diversity and map this diversity to transcriptional shifts coupled with epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming as well as stromal inflammation. Clinically, elevated immature-to-total neutrophil ratios and these immature subsets align with disease severity and mortality, supporting biomarker-guided stratification. Stage-specific therapeutic strategies are evaluated along the continuum of emergency granulopoiesis, calibrating NETosis, and modulating metabolic reprogramming and epigenetics to restore neutrophil homeostasis. Furthermore, we delineate testable priorities for future research such as standardizing immature neutrophil phenotyping across cohorts and defining harmonized immature-to-total neutrophil ratio thresholds. By explicitly centering emergency granulopoiesis and integrating single-cell biology with bedside indicators, this review clarifies why a protective program becomes maladaptive in sepsis and outlines practical avenues for targeted interventions and trial design."
33094141,Pre and postnatal diagnosis of congenital portosystemic shunt: Impact of interventional therapy.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are rare vascular malformations that can lead to severe complications. With advanced imaging techniques, diagnosis is becoming more feasible occurring in fetal life. Different approaches have been adopted to manage these cases, with an increased utilization of interventional therapy recently. This cohort aims to describe the course of children diagnosed with CPSS and the impact of interventional therapy on the outcome. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was done for all patients who were diagnosed with CPSS in our institution between January 2006 and December 2015. RESULTS: Six patients were diagnosed with CPSS. During this period, 8,680 mothers carrying 9548 fetuses underwent fetal ultrasound examinations. Three patients were diagnosed antenatally at a median [IQ] gestational age of 33 [26-33] weeks, and three patients were diagnosed postnatally at 0, 2, and 43 months, respectively. At a median follow-up of 87 [74-110] months, 5 patients are alive; 4 of whom had received transcatheter closure for different indications, and one who had spontaneous resolution of her CPSS. One infant died at the age of 6 weeks secondary to sepsis. CONCLUSION: CPSS can result in significant complications in children. Interventional therapy is feasible at any age group, but long-term follow-up is warranted."
20182674,"Activity of ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam against 12 common clinical isolates of community-acquired bacteremia.",2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the antimicrobial activities of ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam against 12 common organisms that cause community-acquired bacteremia and to identify the most active agents for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: 1200 blood specimens from patients with community-acquired bacteremia were collected at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. All isolates were identified by the API system, and each culture's antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the standard disk-diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were detected by the Epsilimeter test. RESULTS: The in vitro susceptibilities of 11 of the 12 common pathogens to ertapenem were 100%. The frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 6.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Only 48% and 50% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. These data infer that ciprofloxacin should not be given for ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam had high activity against the most common pathogens isolated. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL E. coli and K. pneumoniae are highly resistant to ciprofloxacin, so this antibiotic should be avoided for patients with community-acquired bacteremia. ESBL E. coli and K. pneumoniae are highly susceptible to ertapenem."
19956924,Plasma and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in septic versus non-septic acute kidney injury in critical illness.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is the most common trigger for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. We sought to determine whether there are unique patterns to plasma and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in septic compared with non-septic AKI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Two adult ICUs in Melbourne, Australia. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with septic and non-septic AKI. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood and urine specimens collected at enrollment, 12, 24 and 48 h to measure plasma and urine NGAL. Eighty-three patients were enrolled (septic n = 43). Septic AKI patients had more co-morbid disease (p = 0.005), emergency surgical admissions (p < 0.001), higher illness severity (p = 0.008), more organ dysfunction (p = 0.008) and higher white blood cell counts (p = 0.01). There were no differences at enrollment between groups in AKI severity. Septic AKI was associated with significantly higher plasma (293 vs. 166 ng/ml) and urine (204 vs. 39 ng/mg creatinine) NGAL at enrollment compared with non-septic AKI (p < 0.001). Urine NGAL remained higher in septic compared with non-septic AKI at 12 h (p < 0.001) and 24 h (p < 0.001). Plasma NGAL showed fair discrimination for AKI progression (area under receiver-operator characteristic curve 0.71) and renal replacement therapy (AuROC 0.78). Although urine NGAL performed less well (AuROC 0.70, 0.70), peak urine NGAL predicted AKI progression better in non-septic AKI (AuROC 0.82). CONCLUSION: Septic AKI patients have higher detectable plasma and urine NGAL compared with non-septic AKI patients. These differences in NGAL values in septic AKI may have diagnostic and clinical relevance as well as pathogenetic implications."
31853447,Machine learning in data abstraction: A computable phenotype for sepsis and septic shock diagnosis in the intensive care unit.,2019,"BACKGROUND: With the recent change in the definition (Sepsis-3 Definition) of sepsis and septic shock, an electronic search algorithm was required to identify the cases for data automation. This supervised machine learning method would help screen a large amount of electronic medical records (EMR) for efficient research purposes. AIM: To develop and validate a computable phenotype via supervised machine learning method for retrospectively identifying sepsis and septic shock in critical care patients. METHODS: A supervised machine learning method was developed based on culture orders, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, serum lactate levels and vasopressor use in the intensive care units (ICUs). The computable phenotype was derived from a retrospective analysis of a random cohort of 100 patients admitted to the medical ICU. This was then validated in an independent cohort of 100 patients. We compared the results from computable phenotype to a gold standard by manual review of EMR by 2 blinded reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by a critical care clinician. A SOFA score >/= 2 during the ICU stay with a culture 72 h before or after the time of admission was identified. Sepsis versions as V1 was defined as blood cultures with SOFA >/= 2 and Sepsis V2 was defined as any culture with SOFA score >/= 2. A serum lactate level >/= 2 mmol/L from 24 h before admission till their stay in the ICU and vasopressor use with Sepsis-1 and-2 were identified as Septic Shock-V1 and-V2 respectively. RESULTS: In the derivation subset of 100 random patients, the final machine learning strategy achieved a sensitivity-specificity of 100% and 84% for Sepsis-1, 100% and 95% for Sepsis-2, 78% and 80% for Septic Shock-1, and 80% and 90% for Septic Shock-2. An overall percent of agreement between two blinded reviewers had a k = 0.86 and 0.90 for Sepsis 2 and Septic shock 2 respectively. In validation of the algorithm through a separate 100 random patient subset, the reported sensitivity and specificity for all 4 diagnoses were 100%-100% each. CONCLUSION: Supervised machine learning for identification of sepsis and septic shock is reliable and an efficient alternative to manual chart review."
15615466,[Initial antibiotic therapy of neonatal sepsis].,2004,"It is certain that in the past the types of bacterial agents responsible for neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity to antibiotics were not the same in all historical periods. However, the reports confirming the conclusion have been published only in the last three years. According to these facts, the bacterial causes of neonatal sepsis were analyzed in patients treated at the University children's hospital in Belgrade (S&M) as well as their sensitivity to antibiotics to determine the most effective initial therapy. Between January 2001 and June 2004, 35 neonates, aged from 1-30 days, with positive blood culture were treated. Gram-negative bacteria were the cause of sepsis in 57% of patients (Pseudomonas--20%, Klebsiella--20%, E. coli--8.5%, Acinetobacter--8.5%), gram-positive in 43% (coagulase-negative Staphylococci--14%, Staphylococcus epidermidis--14%, Staphylococcus aureus--9%, Streptococcus group B--3%, Listeria monocytogenes--3%). The bacteria were the most sensitive to carbapenems (85-89%), amikacin (68%), third-generation cephalosporins (47-50%), while the sensitivity to gentamicin was less than expected (48.5%). Sensitivity to ampicillin (8%) confirmed a high level of resistance to this antibiotic. All isolated Staphylococci were sensitive to vancomycin, and the overall methicillin resistance was 46%. Combined cefotaxime and amikacin therapy was the most effective of all suggested initial combinations of antibiotics (74%). The sensitivity to all other combinations of antibiotics was 51-71%. The most adequate initial combination of antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsis is cefotaxime plus amikacin. The most adequate antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial neonatal sepsis is carbapenem."
19940835,"Acute HIV infection - New York City, 2008.",2009,"Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) is a highly infectious phase of disease that lasts approximately 2 months and is characterized by nonspecific clinical symptoms. AHI contributes disproportionately to HIV transmission because it is associated with a high level of viremia, despite negative or indeterminate antibody (Ab) tests. Diagnosis of AHI with individual or pooled nucleic acid amplification tests (p-NAAT) can enable infected persons to adopt behaviors that reduce HIV transmission, facilitate partner referral for counseling and testing, and identify social networks of persons with elevated rates of HIV transmission. The national HIV surveillance case definition does not distinguish AHI from other stages of HIV infection, and the frequency of AHI among reported HIV cases is unknown. In 2008, to increase detection of AHI and demonstrate the feasibility of AHI surveillance, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) initiated p-NAAT screening at four sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and enhanced citywide HIV surveillance (using a standard case definition) to differentiate AHI among newly reported cases. Seventy cases of AHI (representing 1.9% of all 3,635 HIV diagnoses reported in New York City) were identified: 53 cases from enhanced surveillance and 17 cases from p-NAAT screening (representing 9% of 198 HIV diagnoses at the four clinics). Men who have sex with men (MSM) constituted 81% of AHI cases. Screening STD clinic patients, especially MSM, with p-NAAT can identify additional cases of HIV infection. Surveillance for AHI is feasible and can identify circumstances in which HIV prevention efforts should be intensified."
19968839,Antibody drop in newborns congenitally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi treated with benznidazole.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the drop of Chagas antibody titres between non-infected and congenitally infected newborns treated by two doses of benznidazole, aiming at evaluating the recovery time and giving recommendations regarding serological criteria of recovery. METHODS: During a clinical trial, the drop of Trypanosoma cruzi antibody titres measured by ELISA tests was followed during the first year of life in congenitally infected newborns treated with different doses of benznidazole and compared to T. cruzi antibody titres in non-parasitaemic newborns. Confirmation of recovery was given by two negative serological tests: Chagas Stat-Pak (CSP) (immunochromatography) and Chagatest v3.0 (ELISA). RESULTS: In non-parasitaemic infants of infected mothers, antibodies of maternal origin disappeared in <8 months while in infected infants, T. cruzi antibodies decreased more slowly and disappeared in 9-16 months allowing to confirm the recovery. All CSP tests were negative before the ninth month while about 10% of ELISA tests remained positive at the 12th month. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery may be confirmed in most cases at 10 months. The CSP test was compared to Chagatest v3.0 ELISA and appeared to give a reliable response. The decrease rate of antibodies does not depend on treatment modes."
31863825,Development of a real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of spring viremia of carp virus.,2020,"Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) is a significant pathogenic agent that can cause large-scale outbreaks of spring viremia of carp (SVC) in many types of fish and bring huge economic losses to the aquaculture industry. A simple and convenient detection method is imperative for SVCV diagnosis. In this study, the real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed and validated. Primers and probe targeting the conserved region of M gene were designed and applied to the real-time RT-RPA assay that performed at 39  degrees C for 20 min. The specificity analysis showed that no cross-reaction with other pathogenic viruses of fish was found, indicating appropriate specificity of the assay. In vitro transcribed RNA standards were used to estimate the sensitivity of the assay and the detection limit was 10(2)copies/reaction. To further evaluate the assay, 65 clinical samples were tested using both real-time RT-RPA assay and real-time RT-PCR method. The same detection results were observed, suggesting the potential application of real-time RT-RPA assay in clinical sample detection. This is the first report on RPA assay for SVCV detection and this new developed assay would be useful in both laboratory and in the field for diagnosis of SVCV."
41550645,Nanoplatforms in sepsis storm: Multimodal synergy for precision immunomodulation and pathogen neutralizations.,2025,"Sepsis, a severe global health challenge characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction stemming from a dysregulated immune response to drug-resistant pathogens, imposes a substantial disease burden. The intricate nature of sepsis necessitates meticulous drug administration and underscores the urgency for advanced drug delivery strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in nanotechnology-driven therapeutic interventions for sepsis, emphasizing innovative approaches such as stimulus-responsive and nano-drug delivery systems that have been applied to tackle sepsis and its associated complications. Drawing from various theories and mechanistic insights into sepsis pathogenesis, we explore novel therapeutic avenues and their potential integration with nano-delivery systems, considering factors such as the microenvironment. We demonstrate how these nano-delivery systems can enhance treatment accuracy and diversity. Furthermore, the synergy between nanomedicine and emerging technologies like CRISPR, CAR-T therapy, AI, microfluidics, microbiome research, and immunotherapy holds the promise to revolutionize sepsis diagnosis, treatment, and management strategies. However, overcoming pathogen resistance, precisely modulating excessive immune response/immunosuppression, and achieving efficient targeted delivery of nanocarriers in complex pathological environments remain core challenges. Future research needs to focus on the development of smarter and more responsive nanoplatforms and deeply explore their deep integration with multiple cutting-edge technologies in order to advance the clinical translation of precision sepsis diagnosis and treatment."
31806658,Prevention of Bloodstream Infections in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis.,2020,"Bloodstream infections are an important cause of hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality in patients receiving hemodialysis. Eliminating bloodstream infections in the hemodialysis setting has been the focus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Making Dialysis Safer for Patients Coalition and, more recently, the CDC's partnership with the American Society of Nephrology's Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety Initiative. The majority of vascular access-associated bloodstream infections occur in patients dialyzing with central vein catheters. The CDC's core interventions for bloodstream infection prevention are the gold standard for catheter care in the hemodialysis setting and have been proven to be effective in reducing catheter-associated bloodstream infection. However, in the United States hemodialysis catheter-associated bloodstream infections continue to occur at unacceptable rates, possibly because of lapses in adherence to strict aseptic technique, or additional factors not addressed by the CDC's core interventions. There is a clear need for novel prophylactic therapies. This review highlights the recent advances and includes a discussion about the potential limitations and adverse effects associated with each option."
25916028,"Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from septicemia in Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran.",2014,"INTRODUCTION: The choice of antimicrobial treatment for septicemia is often empirical and based on the knowledge of local anti-microbial activity patterns of the most common bacteria causing such bloodstream infections. The current study aimed to study the prevalence of bacterial pathogens causing septicemia and their antimicrobial resistant profiles in hospital admitted patients. METHODS: This cross sectional study done at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. We examined 168 bacterial strains isolated from 186 clinically diagnosed septicemia cases refereed at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. Over a period of twelve months from July 2010 to 2011 July. 11446 blood samples from patients of clinically suggestive septicemia were evaluated. RESULTS: Bacterial strains were isolated from 910 (7.95%) of blood cultures. Gram-negative bacteria identified were Pseudomonas species (20.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.86%), Salmonella spp (1.09%), Acinetobacter naumannii (8.13%), Escherichia coli (4.06%), Klebsiella spp (5.16%). Gram-negative pathogens were more than gram positive in bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, USA) guidelines against: amikacin ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin. Resistanc to different antibiotics in the most important isolated bacteria were: 32.1%, 10.8%, 87.8%, 96%, 39.1%, 35.2, 49.4%, 69%, 80.02%, 22%, 59%, 30.1% respectively, for Pseudomonas spp, 32%, 3.7%, 84.2%, 83.2%, 80.1%, 75.4%, 44.8%, 45.2%, 33.3%, 19%, 34.1, 11.5% respectively for Acinetobacter species. DISCUSSION: Resistant to majority of the antimicrobial agents for several pathogens implicated in bloodstream infections, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, can make complication in treatment of infection cause by them."
25521988,Prolonged incubation period in neonatal Pasteurella multocida meningitis and bacteremia.,2014,"Pasteurella multocida, often found as part of the human oral flora and in finger/toenails, also exists in many animals, especially cats, dogs, and pigs. Although rare, pasteurella infection in neonates can cause serious systemic disease, such as meningitis. In this article, a 23-day-old girl presented with decreased appetite and irritability for >2 days. Eighteen days previously her pet cat had jumped onto the left side of her head while she was sleeping. On laboratory data C-reactive protein was high, and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis leukocyte count was extremely high, with low glucose and high protein. P. multocida grew out of the blood and CSF cultures, and she was successfully treated with antibiotics for 3 weeks. Although pasteurellosis rarely occurs, it can sometimes lead to life-threatening situations, so parents should exercise caution when having pets around their children."
31859083,Elevated serum procalcitonin predicts Gram-negative bloodstream infections in patients with burns.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have suggested that procalcitonin can predict bloodstream infection and also distinguish between Gram-negative, Gram-positive and fungal infections after burn. However, up to now, there is no literature on serum procalcitonin level of multidrug-resistant pathogens and non-multidrug-resistant pathogens among Gram-negative bloodstream infections after burn. The purpose of this study is to explore the value of serum procalcitonin in identifying Gram-negative bloodstream infection in patients with febrile critical burn and then to investigate the difference of serum procalcitonin level between multidrug-resistant pathogens and non-multidrug-resistant pathogens among Gram-negative bloodstream infections after burn. METHODS: Patients with febrile critical burn admitted to the burn department of our hospital from 1 January 2014 to 1 August 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Patients with positive blood culture whose blood samples were collected for simultaneous blood culture and procalcitonin testing were enrolled. All strains were identified by an automatic microorganism analyser, and procalcitonin was analysed by an automatic electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 119 patients with positive blood culture met the inclusion criteria. There were 64 Gram-negative bacilli, 38 Gram-positive bacteria, 8 C. albicans and 9 polymicrobial bloodstream infections. The median procalcitonin value in Gram-negative bloodstream infections (2.67 ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 1.58-6.08) was significantly higher than that in Gram-positive bloodstream infections (1.04 ng/mL, IQR 0.35-1.60, P < 0.01), or C. albicans bloodstream infections (1.09 ng/mL, IQR 0.82-2.30, P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that in addition to polymicrobial bloodstream infections, the area of procalcitonin under the curve distinguishing Gram-negative bloodstream infections from all other blood culture-positive bloodstream infections was 0.761, the best critical value was 1.73 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 73%, the specificity was 74%, the positive predictive value was 80%, the negative predictive value was 67%, The level of procalcitonin was significantly higher in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (2.76 ng/mL, IQR 2.01-7.76) than in non-multidrug-resistant bacilli (1.01 ng/mL, IQR 0.58-1.56, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum procalcitonin can identify Gram-negative bloodstream infections in patients with febrile critical burn. In Gram-negative bloodstream infections, high procalcitonin levels may be associated with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa)."
41475067,Shared inflammation in takotsubo syndrome and sepsis: Lipocalin-2 mediates neutrophil infiltration and cardiac damage.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) and sepsis often co-occur with poor outcomes, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Transcriptomic analysis is employed to detect diagnostic biomarkers and reveal shared pathophysiological mechanisms in sepsis-associated TTS. METHODS: Myocardial gene expression data (TTS, sepsis, and controls) from GEO were analyzed to identify shared differentially expressed genes. WGCNA and PPI networks were used for candidate gene selection. Key genes were further refined using random forest and LASSO algorithms. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT. Myocardial injury and gene expression in rat models were evaluated using HE staining, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blotting. Clinical validation was conducted using plasma samples from the China TTS Registry. t-tests and ANOVA were conducted via GraphPad Prism 8 software. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was recognized as an important biomarker through WGCNA, PPI network analysis, and machine learning algorithms, showing strong predictive performance. Its expression was significantly associated with neutrophil infiltration and myocardial injury in TTS. Consistent with the bioinformatics findings, the TTS-sepsis comorbidity model showed elevated mRNA and protein levels of LCN2 in myocardial tissue, accompanied by increased neutrophil infiltration and severe cardiac injury. Clinical validation confirmed elevated plasma LCN2 levels in patients with sepsis-associated TTS, correlating with neutrophil counts, NT-proBNP, and cTnI levels. CONCLUSION: LCN2 is identified as a key inflammatory mediator linking neutrophil-driven inflammation to myocardial injury in sepsis-associated TTS, with dual potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target."
25519876,High serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with pediatric sepsis.,2014,"Despite major advances in intensive care, sepsis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D is involved in various physiologic functions, including cellular responses during infection and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in childhood sepsis because it can be fatal if diagnosis delayed. The study included 40 children with sepsis and 20 children without sepsis (control group). We included only the patients with high probable sepsis, judged by clinical and laboratory findings, including positive blood culture. Blood samples were collected from patients with sepsis before treatment (pre-treatment group) and 48-72 hours later (post-treatment group). Treatment varied from ampicillin-sulbactam to cephalosporin. Blood samples were collected from control group once on admission. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher in sepsis (pre-treatment group) than control group (74 +/- 8 ng/ml vs. 28 +/- 12 ng/ml, p = 0.01) and the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were decreased to 44 +/- 5 ng/ml (p = 0.01) after treatment. Moreover, we found significant positive correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and each of well-know sepsis markers, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. A cut-off point of 20 ng/mL for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D showed 84% sensitivity and 76% specificity for sepsis diagnosis. This is the first study evaluating the diagnostic role of vitamin D in pediatric sepsis, thereby suggesting that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level can be used as a diagnostic marker for sepsis with high sensitivity and specificity."
41469754,Immune cell profiling supports early prediction of sepsis-associated acute kidney disease using a decision tree algorithm.,2025,"Sepsis is a major cause of acute kidney injury, progressing to sepsis-associated acute kidney disease (SA-AKD). This study explores SA-AKD prediction by combining immune cell profiling. Peripheral immune cell expression and phenotypes were analyzed in sepsis patients without (n = 97) and with (n = 41) SA-AKD, admitted to a hospital (2020-2022). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were measured, and a decision tree (DT)-based model was used to evaluate their predictive power in the training (n = 106) and validation (n = 32) cohorts. The DT model, incorporating naive Treg and CD56(dim) NK cells along with clinical parameters, showed high accuracy in predicting SA-AKD. The model using blood urea nitrogen as the first node reached 89.62% accuracy (sensitivity: 94.4% and specificity: 87.14%; area under the curve = 0.91). The model starting with creatinine showed 89.62% accuracy. Validation results confirmed an 81.25% accuracy. Profiling specific immune cells may enable pre-evaluation of SA-AKD."
20128355,[Therapeutic efficacy of a regimen of artesunate-mefloquine-primaquine treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and treatment effects on gametocytic development].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: The treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria requires a safe and effective therapeutic treatment regimen, which in turn has high impact on the transmission. In 2006, an artesunate (AS)-mefloquine (MQ) treatment program was implemented in Antioquia. In addition, primaquine (PQ) was added to eliminate malaria gametocytes in the bloodstream. OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and gametocytocidal activity was evaluated for two treatment regimens, AS-MQ-PQ and AS-MQ, in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2007 and February 2008, 50 patients were recruited for the trial in Turbo, Antioquia. A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Treatment compliance was supervised, with a clinical and parasitological assessment on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 to evaluate response rate according to the WHO 2003 protocol. RESULTS: Clinical response and parasite elimination efficacy of AS-MQ (with or without PQ) was 100% (95% CI 86.3%-100%), and parasitemia and fever were absent on day 3 of treatment in all patients. Gametocyte elimination was superior when PQ was used--92% (95% CI: 74%-99%) of patients who received PQ had no gametocytes on day 3, compared to 78.3% (95% CI: 59%-93%) of patients who only received AS-MQ. Furthermore, circulating gametocytes were eliminated on average one week faster when the AS-MQ-PQ treatment scheme was used compared to the scheme without PQ. CONCLUSION: These studies recommend the use of AS-MQ to treat P. falciparum malaria given its good therapeutic efficacy. However, further assessment is suggested concerning the benefit of adding PQ to this treatment scheme."
25516871,Gastric trichobezoar associated with perforated peptic ulcer and Candida glabrata infection.,2014,"Bezoars are accumulations of human or plant fiber located in the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals. Patients remain asymptomatic for several years, and the symptoms develop as these accumulations increase in size to the point of obstruction or perforation. We report the case of a 21-year-old patient at 10 d postpartum, who presented with acute abdomen associated with sepsis. Given the urgency of the clinical picture, at no point was the presence of a giant bezoar at gastric level suspected, specifically a trichobezoar. The emergency abdominal and pelvic ultrasound revealed only unspecific signs of perforated hollow viscus. Diagnosis was therefore made intraoperatively. A complete gastric trichobezoar was found with gastric perforation and secondary peritonitis. The peritoneal fluid culture revealed Candida glabrata."
15627067,High-dose ifosfamide with hematopoietic growth factor support in advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas.,2004,"AIM: Ifosfamide and doxorubicin are the most effective agents in the treatment of sarcomas, although their contributions to survival are usually limited. High-dose ifosfamide can be used as a salvage treatment in patients with recurrent or advanced sarcoma. We evaluated efficacy and toxicity of high-dose ifosfamide in the patients with recurrent or advanced sarcoma in this study. METHODS: 39 patients with recurrent or advanced sarcoma were enrolled onto the study between 1996 and 2002. All patients had histological proven high grade sarcoma with measurable or evaluable disease. Ifosfamide was administered at the dose of 2 g/m(2) as continuous intravenous infusion for 24 h on day 1-9, in conjunction with the continuous infusion of mesna. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given every cycle. The efficacy and toxicity of high dose ifosfamide (HDI) were evaluated clinically before subsequent cycle. The objective response was evaluated every two cycles. Histopathologic response was also evaluated in patients who underwent surgical resection. RESULTS: Male/female ratio was 24/15, with a median age of 20 (11-48) years. 9 patients had locally inoperable advanced disease and 30 patients had metastatic disease. 10 patients were chemo-naive. The total number of HDI-chemotherapy cycles was 103 (median 2 cycles (range, 1 to 7)). 2 patients refused the further treatment after the first cycle and 1 patient died due to neutropenic sepsis in the first cycle of treatment. 36 patients were available for the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Overall response rates were 53.8% and 90% in pre-treated patients and in chemo-naive patients, respectively. Median follow-up time was 43 months. 13 patients underwent total surgical tumor resection. Pathologic complete response was observed in 5 of 13 these patients who underwent surgery. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7 months (95%CI: 3.8-10.2). The median progression-free survival (PFS) were 3 and 12 months in patients who did not have tumor resection, and in those having complete tumor resection (p = 0.002). Median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95%CI: 0.0-20) in all patients. Median OS times were 8 months in patients without tumor resection and 26.5 months in patients with those underwent surgical treatment (p = 0.0369). 2 patients who underwent surgery are still alive and disease-free. Major toxicity was myelosuppression. CONCLUSION: HDI seems to be feasible and effective in selected patients with advanced or recurrent sarcomas. Survival advantage of HDI is better when the total tumor resection can be done."
20042672,Plasmacytoid dendritic cells control lung inflammation and monocyte recruitment in indirect acute lung injury in mice.,2010,"Indirect acute lung injury (ALI, not caused by a direct insult to the lung) represents the first organ dysfunction in trauma patients, with nonpulmonary sepsis being the most common cause of indirect ALI. Dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to participate in a number of inflammatory lung diseases; however, their role in indirect ALI is currently not established. Using a clinically relevant model of indirect ALI induced in mice by hemorrhagic shock followed 24 hours later by polymicrobial septic challenge, we report that mature DC numbers were markedly increased in the lung during indirect ALI. DC depletion induced a significant increase in indirect ALI severity, which was associated with enhanced lung and plasma proinflammatory cytokine concentration and recruitment of proinflammatory CD115(+) monocytes in response to increased lung monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production. Among the different DC subpopulations, plasmacytoid DCs, which were induced and activated in the lung during indirect ALI, were responsible for this effect because their specific depletion reproduced the observations made in DC-depleted mice. As the recruitment of monocytes to the lung plays a central deleterious role in the pathophysiology of indirect ALI, our data therefore position plasmacytoid DCs as important regulators of acute lung inflammation."
25591812,Association of de novo dipstick albuminuria with severe acute kidney injury in critically ill septic patients.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in septic patients. Albuminuria may play a role as an early marker of septic AKI. The potential association between de novo dipstick albuminuria (DA) and septic AKI has not been examined. METHODS: We conducted a single-center observational cohort study of 423 critically ill septic patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or prior positive DA within 3 months before admission. The association between de novo DA within the first 24 h of presentation and AKI at 72 h was examined. RESULTS: AKI was identified in 268/423 (63%) patients and 20/423 (4.7%) required dialysis. De novo DA was associated with AKI (univariate OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.27-2.86, p = 0.002). The association persisted in a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for demographics, baseline kidney function, comorbidities, critical illness parameters, and exposure to nephrotoxins (adjusted OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.21-2.89, p = 0.005). The association between de novo DA and AKI was stronger for severe AKI, i.e. Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stage 3 (adjusted OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.52-5.85, p = 0.001) and AKIN stage 2 (adjusted OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.002-3.21, p = 0.049) but not AKIN stage 1 (adjusted OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.87-2.29, p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: De novo DA within the first 24 h of admission was independently associated with severe AKI in critically ill septic patients. Future studies are required to fully elucidate the utility of DA testing in the early detection and stratification of AKI."
41607964,Cutaneous and Systemic Complications in Primary CD8+ Aggressive Epidermotropic Cytotoxic T-cell Lymphoma.,2025,"CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma (CD8+ AECTCL) is an uncommon and highly aggressive variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by rapid systemic progression. We present the case of a 61-year-old man with CD8+ AECTCL who developed a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus port-site infection while on duvelisib following prior gemcitabine/liposomal doxorubicin therapy. The patient had been diagnosed with CD8+ AECTCL 18 months prior and presented with acute erythema, swelling, and pain over his left anterior chest. Upon admission, the patient met sepsis criteria, and his port was subsequently removed in addition to the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. During hospitalization, he developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Renal biopsy revealed diabetic nephropathy with findings consistent with renal-limited thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), likely multifactorial from gemcitabine and duvelisib exposure compounded by sepsis and underlying lymphoma. Complement studies supported the activation of the alternative pathway, and after multidisciplinary discussion, eculizumab was initiated for TMA management. The patient completed inpatient eculizumab dosing and was discharged on outpatient infusions. His cutaneous lymphoma lesions improved with a short course of oral prednisone as directed by oncology. At discharge, he was clinically stable on dialysis with plans for ongoing outpatient care; subsequent follow-up showed stable renal function. This case highlights the intersection between aggressive cutaneous lymphoma, infection, and chemotherapy-induced vascular injury, emphasizing the importance of early recognition of systemic complications in CD8+ AECTCL and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes."
32855980,Score at the Door: A retrospective data analysis of sepsis scoring criteria in the Emergency Department.,2019,"The goal of this study was to assess the availability of the criteria of eight sepsis scoring methods (SIRS, NEWS, PRESEP, SOFA, qSOFA, SPEED, MEDS, and PIRO) within six hours of triage in the emergency department (ED). Data was analyzed through a retrospective collection of adult (age >18 years) patients presenting to the MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) emergency department between June 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018 and admitted with a sepsis or sepsis-related diagnosis that progressed to sepsis before discharge. Vital signs are frequently available upon arrival to the ED, while laboratory values tend to be available within three hours and often are not repeated again within the first six hours after arrival. The availability of patient data at different time points in a patient's ED visit suggests that different scoring methods could be utilized to more effectively diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum as more information about the patient becomes available."
41573561,"m-EASIX (better than EASIX) predicts severe CAR T-cell toxicities, worse overall survival, and discriminates cytokine release syndrome from sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are life-threatening complications that often arise after CAR T-cell immunotherapy. Endothelial dysfunction is believed to play a central role in their development, leading to the interest in biomarker-based tools for diagnosis and differentiating these toxicities from sepsis. This study aimed to evaluate the Endothelial Activation Stress Index (EASIX) and its modified version (m-EASIX, which replaces creatinine with C-reactive protein [CRP] (mg/dL)) as early predictors of severe CRS and ICANS, as well as tools to distinguish CRS from sepsis. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy for CD19-positive hematologic malignancies (n=94) or multiple myeloma (n=23) were included. EASIX and m-EASIX scores were measured at various time points: before CAR T-cell infusion, 24-48 hours post-infusion, at CRS or ICANS onset, and after treatment for each toxicity. A comparator group of 129 sepsis patients, including 86 with hematologic malignancies, was also analyzed. RESULTS: Both EASIX and m-EASIX correlated with biomarkers of endotheliopathy, with m-EASIX showing stronger predictive power for severe toxicities and ICU admission. Higher EASIX and m-EASIX values at early time points were associated with worse overall survival (OS). Furthermore, m-EASIX accurately distinguished CRS from sepsis at symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: m-EASIX is a practical and accessible tool for the early prediction of severe CAR T-cell-related toxicities, risk stratification, and differential diagnosis from sepsis, offering potential to guide clinical decision-making and early intervention."
15636670,A 3-week gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen for metastatic urothelial cancer.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-week outpatient schedule of intravenous gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract (TCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A two-stage phase II trial enrolled TCC patients with Karnofsky performance status > or = 60, measurable disease, and adequate organ function. Prior adjunctive chemotherapy was allowed provided it had been completed at least 1 year prior to study entry. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 iv days 1 and 8 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 iv repeated every 21 days. The primary outcome was the objective response rate. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled at six Canadian centres. Three complete and 10 partial responses were observed in 29 eligible patients (overall response rate 45% [95%CI, 27-63%]). Three patients had stable disease and 13 had progressive disease. The relative dose-intensities of gemcitabine and cisplatin were 81% and 88%, respectively. Toxicity was primarily hematological, and 60% of patients experienced at least one episode of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. One patient died of neutropenic sepsis and two died of vascular events while on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and tolerability of this schedule are similar to that reported with the standard 4-week schedule of gemcitabine-cisplatin. In the absence of a large randomized trial, the similarity of these results supports the use of this 3-week program in typical TCC patients treated in both community and academic cancer clinic settings."
20084488,Does gram-negative bacteraemia occur without endotoxaemia? A meta-analysis using hierarchical summary ROC curves.,2010,"The limulus assay for endotoxin has been studied as a method for the rapid identification of gram-negative (GN) bacteraemia. The chromogenic (C-limulus) version is 100-fold more sensitive to an internal endotoxin standard than the earlier gelation version (G-limulus). The objective of this analysis is to compare the concordance between GN bacteraemia and endotoxaemia as determined in clinical studies using either version of the limulus assay. The summary results for the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity and specificity were derived using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) method of meta-analysis. Fifty-eight studies (25 G-limulus and 33 C-limulus) were included. Surprisingly, the mean DOR (4.9; 3-7.9 versus 10.7; 5.2-21.8) was inferior for studies using the C-limulus versus the original G-limulus version of the assay. Moreover, among studies limited to sepsis syndrome patients, the mean DOR remains poor at 4.2 (1.8-9.5). The proportion of GN bacteraemic patients for whom endotoxaemia is not detectable with either version of the limulus assay is >20% among the 58 studies overall, but >30% after the exclusion of studies with <25 patients and >20% among studies of patients with sepsis syndrome. These findings help to reconcile seemingly disparate study results."
15623906,Safety profile of ciprofloxacin used for neonatal septicemia.,2004,"We conducted a case matched control study to observe the adverse effects of ciprofloxacin used in neonatal septicemia We enrolled 30 neonates with multidrug-resistant septicemia who were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin for 14 days. Thirty matched neonates with septicemia treated with other antibiotics were enrolled as controls There was no difference in the mean serum electrolytes, hepatic, renal and hematologic parameters of the two groups. Serial ultrasonographic measurements of the cartilage of the knee after 1 and 6 months showed no difference in the two groups. The femoral cartilage showed an increase of 78.8% in the mean longitudinal area after 6 months in the study group. In the control group, the femoral cartilage showed a 78.4% increase after 6 months. Similarly, the tibial cartilage showed no difference in the percentage increase in size of the study and control group at the end of 6 months. When controlled for birth weight and gestation, cartilage size was not affected by ciprofloxacin."
15621870,Ocular lesions in acute disseminated tuberculosis.,2004,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of ocular involvement in patients with acute disseminated tuberculosis and to assess the findings associated with ocular involvement. METHODS: Assessment of all intensive care (ICU) admissions with a differential diagnosis of mycobacterial sepsis during a period of one year, with a detailed systemic and ophthalmic evaluation. RESULTS: Of 342 admissions, 24 patients were suspected to have mycobacterial infection. Of these 24 cases, 10 were proven to have mycobacterial sepsis, six of which (60%) showed evidence of ocular involvement. Five (83%) of the six patients had choroidal tubercles and one (16%) had retinal vasculitis. Detection of the lesions allowed a lead time of 12-72 hours in which to start earlier targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement in acute disseminated tuberculosis is often seen, with the most common manifestation being choroidal tubercles. Early detection of these lesions may be important in treatment."
25514754,Assessment of human health risk associated with pyaemia in Danish finisher pigs when conducting visual-only inspection of the lungs.,2015,"The most important lesion to be overlooked when performing visual-only inspection of the lungs is embolic pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to assess the additional human health risk represented by overlooking cases of pyaemia represented by embolic pneumonia in finisher pigs, when conducting visual-only compared to palpation of the lungs, as is the traditional meat inspection procedure. An examination of bacteria isolated from 19 finisher pigs identified with embolic pneumonia at traditional meat inspection was undertaken. From each pig samples were taken from various organs (lungs, spleen, heart, liver and kidney), from the carpal joints (A. carpi) and flexor muscle (M. flexor digitorum superficialis) on the right foreleg. These data were included in a risk assessment following OIE guidelines. Bacteria were isolated from 78 out of 127 tissue and swap samples taken (61% positive samples). Staphylococcus aureus (N=37) was the most frequently isolated bacterium. The predominant site of S. aureus was the lung. S. aureus was detected although less frequently in low numbers in some organs (<100CFU/sample) and muscle samples (<10CFU/sample). Only one MRSA isolate was found. Staphylococcus warneri (N=24) was the second most commonly found bacterium. There was no predominant site and the number of S. warneri was less than 50CFU per sample. The risk of a food-borne intoxication from S. aureus in relation to pyaemia in pigs was considered very low due to the low quantitative numbers of S. aureus in muscle tissue samples. Implementing visual-only inspection will reduce the exposure of S. aureus due to less cross-contamination and handling of the plucks by the meat inspectors. The human health risk associated with S. warneri was considered very low, due to the limited zoonotic potential of this bacterium. In conclusion, the additional human health risk in relation to possibly overlooking pyaemia in Danish finisher pigs was considered negligible when conducting visual-only compared to traditional meat inspection."
20181156,A report of a rare congenital malformation in a Nepalese child with congenital pouch colon: a case report.,2009,"Congenital pouch colon is one of rare congenital anomalies. We report a 3-day-old male child with congenital pouch colon who underwent a window colostomy but died because of overwhelming sepsis. Due to its rarity, many surgeons in our part of the world may not be aware of it, hence increasing the potential to its mismanagement. However, with simple keen observations, we can safely come to its diagnosis. The aim of this report is to bring attention to congenital pouch colon associated with anorectal malformation in our country, with a brief emphasis on an approach to its diagnosis and initial management."
20008075,Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.,2010,"To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2."
31848990,Circulating intranuclear proteins may play a role in development of disseminated intravascular coagulation in individuals with acute leukemia.,2020,"Intranuclear proteins, including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and histone H3, released from inflammatory cells activate platelets and the coagulation systems, leading to development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in individuals with sepsis. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that HMGB1 and histone H3 liberated from leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis after chemotherapy might play a role in development of DIC. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively measured plasma levels of coagulation markers and intranuclear proteins in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (n = 17) before and after chemotherapy. Ten of 17 patients were diagnosed with DIC at the time of diagnosis of leukemia. Serum levels of HMGB1 and histone H3 were significantly higher in patients with DIC than in non-DIC patients. Of note, seven patients developed DIC or experienced exacerbation of coagulopathy after administration of anti-leukemic agents. Intriguingly, an increase in levels of HMGB1 and histone H3 were detected in five of seven patients. These findings suggest that intranuclear proteins spontaneously released from leukemia cells may play a role in development of leukemia-related DIC. Additionally, remission induction chemotherapy causes apoptosis of leukemia cells, leading to forced release of intranuclear proteins, which may exacerbate coagulopathy."
41478272,Reevaluating isolated central apnea in early-term and term newborns: A neurological red flag for perinatal stroke.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Seizures are the most frequent initial symptom of perinatal stroke. Apnea, a less commonly recognized neurological presentation, is a cessation of breathing lasting >15 s or shorter if associated with bradycardia. This study explores a monocentric cohort of newborns with perinatal stroke, emphasizing the role of Isolated Central Apnea (ICA) as a potential early indicator of cerebrovascular insult. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on newborns (>/=36 weeks GA) diagnosed with MRI-confirmed perinatal stroke at our institution between March 2019 and March 2024. Infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), congenital infections, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or intrauterine stroke were excluded. Clinical data, neuroimaging findings, EEG/aEEG characteristics, and antiepileptic drug (AED) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 421 newborns who underwent brain MRI, 27 (6 %) were diagnosed with perinatal stroke (16 males; median GA 38.5 weeks; mean BW 3137g). Seizures were the presenting symptom in 18 cases (67 %), while 8 cases (30 %) exhibited ICA as the first sign and an MRI revealing 5 arterial strokes (63 %) and 3 venous strokes (37 %). EEG abnormalities were detected in 7/8 (88 %) cases, while brain ultrasound was abnormal in 5/8 (63 %). AED therapy was required in 7/8 (88 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS: ICA is an early sign of neonatal stroke in approximately one-third of cases. These findings underscore the importance of brain MRI in the diagnostic workup of persistent apnea in term and early-term neonates."
41463121,Proteomics Reveals Differential Diagnosis Biomarkers Between Sepsis and Hemophagocytic Syndrome.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) shares many clinical features with sepsis. To improve HLH diagnosis and its differential diagnosis with sepsis, serum proteomic analyses of healthy donors, HLH and septic patients were performed. Methods: Twenty-four individuals were enrolled in a label-free MS/MS spectrometry analysis. STRING was conducted to study the protein-protein interactions overrepresented within the proteins of each comparison. To integrate the functions of the proteins with their respective regulation patterns, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used. Validation of selected proteins was carried out by ELISA. Results: Proteomic results revealed 537 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between HLH and sepsis, 471 DEPs between HLH and healthy donors, and 37 DEPs between sepsis and healthy donors. These results were subjected to functional analysis, which showed that apart from inflammation and lipid metabolism, the proteostasis network was deeply impaired in the HLH condition. Considering this information, protein fold changes and the functions of six proteins were validated by ELISA. Conclusions: sCD300a, sCD300b and sCD25 could be specific serum biomarkers for HLH diagnosis, and SAA-1 and LRG1 might be useful biomarkers for differential diagnosis between sepsis and HLH. PSMB1, a non-catalytic subunit of the 20S proteasome, showed promising results for HLH-specific and differential diagnosis. Its elevation in HLH patients may reflect an intensified demand for protein turnover, possibly driven by a higher activation of the immunoproteasome. These insights contribute to expanding our understanding of HLH pathophysiology regarding new pathways and highlight innovative therapeutic interventions, such as Bortezomib and other next-generation inhibitors, designed to modulate immunoproteasome activity."
41657574,Case Report: Extensive colonic necrosis and perforation in an HIV patient with syphilis complicated by sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: 'Soluble' total colon necrosis is a rare condition with an unclear etiology and few reports on treatment modalities. This case report describes severe intestinal necrosis in an HIV-infected patient, detailing clinical manifestations, diagnostic process, treatment regimen, and outcomes, thereby providing a reference for similar cases in the future. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 41-year-old man diagnosed with HIV 6 years ago, receiving long-term therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz. He has no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, inflammatory bowel disease, or intestinal tuberculosis, but has had multiple sexual partners. He was admitted with 3 h of abdominal pain; a blood pressure of 108/76 mmHg; a heart rate of 148 bpm, and physical findings of generalized abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, muscle rigidity, and diminished bowel sounds. Laboratory results showed elevated procalcitonin (5.15 ng/mL), white blood cells (9.2 x 10;9/L), and C-reactive protein (232.10 mg/L). Abdominal CT revealed thickened walls in the ileocecal region, colon, and rectum, with small bowel dilation, gas, and fluid accumulation, indicating hollow organ perforation and diffuse peritonitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed extensive necrosis of the colon and rectum, with perforation at the hepatic flexure of the colon. A total colectomy, rectal resection, and ileostomy were performed. Postoperative pathology revealed acute and chronic suppurative inflammation with necrosis and perforation. Postoperative sepsis developed, and further examination revealed the presence of syphilis antibodies and liver function impairment. Following treatment with anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, liver-protective, and nutritional support therapies, the patient's condition improved. On the 9th postoperative day, the patient was transferred to a community hospital for further treatment and was discharged on the 23rd postoperative day. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the rare occurrence of extensive necrosis and perforation of the colon in an HIV-infected patient with co-occurring syphilis. Although the precise role of syphilis in the development of gastrointestinal complications remains uncertain, this case highlights the need for heightened clinical awareness of co-infections in immunocompromised patients."
41497389,Vasoactive drug use in children with community acquired septic shock in Australia and New Zealand.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Vasoactive agents are a critical supportive therapy for children with sepsis. We describe the choice and use patterns of vasoactive agents in children with sepsis. METHODS: Prospective observational study conducted in 11 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand through the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) Network from April 2021 to December 2023. Children aged 0-<18 years with suspected sepsis were included. Children admitted to hospital and treated with parenteral antibiotics and either 1) a provisional diagnosis of sepsis, and/or 2) treatment for suspected sepsis (fluid bolus to treat poor perfusion). The frequency and sequence of use of vasoactive agents, and contributors to the choice of initial vasoactive were collected. FINDINGS: 6232 children with suspected sepsis were included; median age of 2.1 years (IQR 0.3-7.1 years), in-hospital mortality of 60 (1.0%), in whom a subset of 306 (4.9%) met Phoenix sepsis criteria. Vasoactive agents were used in 179 (2.9%) children overall and in 144 (45.8%) of those meeting Phoenix sepsis criteria. The most used first, second, and third-line vasoactive agents were adrenaline (90/179; 50.3%), noradrenaline (49/91; 53.8%), and vasopressin (16/40; 40.0%). When comparing noradrenaline vs adrenaline as first line agents, increasing age was associated with preferential use of noradrenaline (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09; p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Children with suspected community acquired sepsis rarely received treatment with vasoactive agents. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were the most used agents, though there was substantial variation in their use and sequencing. FUNDING: This study is funded in part by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Medical Research Future Fund grant (GNT1190814).

25980124,[Clinical data mining by exploring public MIMIC-II intensive care database].,2014,"This paper introduces a free and publicly open ICU database: multi-parameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II: MIMIC-II, which has been built up and maintained by the laboratory of computational physiology at the Massachusetts Institute Technology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Philips Healthcare over the past decade. This paper briefly introduces its infrastructure, implementation and applications in clinical studies. Clinical study pertaining to circadian variation in heart rate and blood pressure during sepsis is shown as a typical example of research performed with MIMIC-II. In this study, it was found there was significant difference in circadian variation in both heart rate and blood pressure between survival and non-survival groups in septic patients. This study tackled several important techniques necessary for the investigation of the circadian rhythm."
20464334,Enteroparasitosis prevalence and parasitism influence in clinical outcomes of tuberculosis patients with or without HIV co-infection in a reference hospital in Rio de Janeiro (2000-2006).,2009,"Tuberculosis and intestinal parasites affect primarily low social and economic level populations, living clustered in precarious habitational settings. One of the interesting aspects of this interaction is the parasitism influence in cellular response to tuberculosis. In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence of enteroparasitosis in tuberculosis patients, HIV-infected and non HIV infected, and we observed the influence of helminth presence in the response to tuberculin skin test (TST) and tuberculosis clinical outcomes. From 607 clinical records reviewed, 327 individuals met the study inclusion criteria and did not present any exclusion criteria. The prevalence of enteroparasites observed was 19.6%. There was no significant association among TST result and the variables related to the presence of: helminthes, protozoa, and stool test for parasites result (p>0.5). Considering the survival of this cohort, we may observe that there is no significant difference (p>0.05) between the survival curves of parasited and non parasited individuals. Solely the variable ""eosinophils"" presents a statistically significant association (p<0.001) with helminthes, all other associations are considered not significant. Our findings neither show an association between helminthic infection and a favorable tuberculosis outcome, nor between parasitism and TST response, unlike other in vitro studies. Apparently, experimental data do not correspond to the clinical findings."
25532112,Morbidity and mortality after minor bile duct injury following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Cystic duct and Luschka duct leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy are often classified as minor injuries because the outcome of endoscopic stenting and percutaneous drainage is generally reported to be good. However, the potential associated early mortality and risk factors for mortality are scarcely reported. The aim of this study was to describe the outcome, mortality, and risk factors for poor survival of patients with type A bile duct injury (BDI) referred to a tertiary center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and January 2012, 800 patients were referred for BDI treatment and included in a prospective database. RESULTS: Type A BDI, according to the Amsterdam and Strasberg classifications, was diagnosed in 216 patients. Treatment after referral was mainly endoscopic (n = 192 [88.9 %]) and radiologic (n = 14 [6.5 %]). Complications related to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) occurred in 14 patients (6.5 %). Other complications were sepsis (n = 34 [15.7 %]), cardiopulmonary (n = 22 [10.2 %]), and abscess formation (n = 15 [6.9 %]). BDI-related mortality was 4.2 % (9/216). Multivariate analysis showed age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.00 - 1.07) and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 or 4 (HR = 5.64, 95 %CI 2.31 - 13.77) to be independent factors significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Type A ""minor"" BDI after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with considerable short-term mortality related to the patient's condition at referral. Older patients and patients with ASA 3 or 4 have a significantly higher risk of mortality."
41602249,Pyosalpinx-Induced Pelvic Sepsis Prompting Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy and Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in a Premenopausal Woman.,2025,"Pyosalpinx is a rare infection of the fallopian tube characterized by pus accumulation and inflammation, which can progress to severe sepsis if not promptly treated. We describe a 54-year-old premenopausal woman who presented with fever, localized abdominal pain, and laboratory findings consistent with sepsis. Diagnostic imaging revealed a complex adnexal mass concerning for a tubo-ovarian abscess. Despite empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the infection persisted, prompting a robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for definitive source control. Surgical pathology confirmed pyosalpinx with abscess formation. The presence of clue cells and the absence of sexually transmitted pathogens suggested bacterial vaginosis as the likely infectious source. This case emphasizes that upper genital tract infections can occur in women without traditional risk factors and that altered vaginal flora may play a significant role in their development. Prompt diagnosis, empiric antibiotic coverage, and timely surgical intervention remain crucial to prevent complications and ensure favorable outcomes."
15727386,Effect of pentoxifylline on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels in neonatal sepsis.,2004,"Several pharmacological agents have been found to alter systemic concentrations and/or the activity of different cytokines via a variety of mechanisms, including changes in biosynthesis, secretion, and/or stability. Pentoxifylline (PTX), which is a methylxanthine derivative for example, has multiple effects on the immune system, but inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release predominates. In this study we aimed to evaluate the influence of PTX on plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 in newborn infants with sepsis. The study included 20 infants with neonatal sepsis. In all subjects blood samples for serum C-reactive protein, TNF alpha and IL-6 determinations were received before giving PTX and at the 12th and 24th hours following PTX. In addition, white blood cell was counted before giving PTX and on the 3rd and 7th day following PTX. The infants were randomly divided into two groups. Firstly, PTX was used in infants who were successively admitted to the clinic and the subsequent infants were accepted as a control group. Of 20 infants, 13 infants received PTX and seven infants did not. We did not find any difference in the leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein level, TNF alpha and IL-6 levels between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). While three infants died in the group of receiving PTX, death was not recorded in the group of non-receiving PTX (P>0.05). Our findings showed that PTX treatment did not affect leukocyte counts, serum CRP levels, TNF alpha and IL-6 levels and death ratio in newborn infants with sepsis. The last result may be due to the fact that the number of patients in the study was very small. We think that more extensive and controlled studies should be performed about this subject."
41585247,Maternal inflammatory biomarkers and neonatal characteristics as predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Maternal peripartum inflammation may contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, yet readily available hematologic predictors are underexplored. We evaluated whether the maternal platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PWR) within 24 h before delivery, together with neonatal clinical variables, predicts BPD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary NICU in Southwest China, including all eligible mother-infant pairs with preterm birth (<37 weeks) between June 2020 and June 2024. BPD was defined per the 2018 NICHD criteria. Maternal demographics, obstetric complications, hematology (WBC, PLT, PWR, NLR, and PLR), and neonatal characteristics (gestational age, birth weight, sex, Apgar score, SGA, sepsis, and respiratory support) were abstracted from electronic records. Variables with p < 0.10 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Model performance was assessed by AUC, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, bootstrap calibration, and a nomogram was constructed. RESULTS: Among 345 pairs, 117 infants (33.9%) developed BPD. Mothers of BPD infants had higher WBC and lower PLT, yielding a lower PWR (median 18.9 vs. 23.1, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, lower maternal PWR independently predicted BPD (aOR = 0.94 per unit increase; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; p = 0.002). Additional independent predictors included chorioamnionitis (aOR = 1.94; 1.01-3.71; p = 0.046), male sex (aOR = 1.61; 1.00-2.59; p = 0.049), early-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.45; 1.04-5.77; p = 0.040), late-onset sepsis (aOR = 2.86; 1.47-5.56; p = 0.002), and mechanical ventilation >7 days (aOR = 6.74; 3.34-13.62; p < 0.001). Gestational age and birth weight were protective (per week: aOR = 0.68; 0.58-0.79; p < 0.001; per 100 g: aOR = 0.86; 0.78-0.94; p = 0.001). The final model showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.866; 95% CI, 0.827-0.905) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi (2) = 10.833, p = 0.211; bootstrap slope = 0.98). At the optimal probability threshold (0.763), sensitivity was 77.2% and specificity was 80.9%. A nomogram enables individualized risk estimation. CONCLUSION: A lower maternal PWR measured immediately before delivery, alongside established neonatal risk factors, independently predicts BPD in preterm infants. This simple hematologic marker, integrated into a nomogram, may facilitate early identification and targeted prevention strategies in high-risk dyads."
15651166,[An auto-iatrogenic disease].,2004,"A 55-year-old practitioner from an island in the northern sea felt an increasing hypersensitivity of his entire body to various ambient and nutritional allergens and toxics. He started to treat himself with increasing doses of glucocorticoids and moved to a southern climate in Lanzarote and later on to the Swiss mountains in the grisons. On admission to our hospital in December he was in a disastrous psychotic condition, trying to cool down his body by laying naked on his bed at ambient temperatures around the freezing point. He had consumed on average 250 mg prednisone daily over weeks. As we found out later his personal assistant travelling with him was giving him glucocorticoids through the infusion during his hospital stay. He developed a necrotizing septic phlebitis at the infusion site followed by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis with fatal multiorgan failure. This case illustrates the dangers of self-treatment by doctors and the difficulties in treating a physician."
15621137,Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatitis B: a single-center study of 35 patients.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Results of liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B (HBV) have improved in the past decade but recently drug resistance has been described, the clinical significance of which is unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate outcomes of LT for HBV and describe the prevalence of drug resistance. METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and review of the organ transplant database was performed to identify all patients transplanted for HBV between December 1982 and April 2004 who survived more than 3 months. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were transplanted for HBV during this period: 27 men and 8 women. Median age at LT was 48.8 years (range 18.9 to 74.3). Four patients were transplanted for fulminant liver failure and 31 for decompensated cirrhosis. Intramuscular HBIG was administered to 8 patients and intravenous HBIG to 32 patients, data were unavailable for three patients. Lamivudine was prescribed for 18 patients (58%) pre-OLT and for 31 patients (88.6%) post-LT. Drug-resistant HBV developed in two patients (5.71%) receiving lamivudine and HBIG. Adefovir substitution resulted in improvement in liver function tests, in HBV DNA and in histology in both patients. Twenty-five patients are currently alive with and 1-year survival of 95% and a 5-year survival of 75%. Causes of death were respiratory failure (n = 3), metastatic cancer of unknown primary (n = 2), renal failure (n = 2), sepsis (n = 1), cerebrovascular accident (n = 1), and cerebral edema (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: LT for HBV shows survival rates comparable to other liver transplant recipients. Lamivudine resistance was rare in this series but responded to adefovir substitution."
25526426,Antibiotic regimens for management of intra-amniotic infection.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis is a common infection that affects both mother and infant. Infant complications associated with chorioamnionitis include early neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Chorioamnionitis can also result in maternal morbidity such as pelvic infection and septic shock.Clinical chorioamnionitis is estimated to occur in 1% to 2% of term births and in 5% to 10% of preterm births; histologic chorioamnionitis is found in nearly 20% of term births and in 50% of preterm births. Women with chorioamnionitis have a two to three times higher risk for cesarean delivery and a three to four times greater risk for endomyometritis, wound infection, pelvic abscess, bacteremia, and postpartum hemorrhage. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of administering antibiotic regimens for intra-amniotic infection on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality and on infection-related complications. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 October 2014), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the WHO ICTRP (September 2014). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included women who experienced intra-amniotic infection. Trials were included if they compared antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment (if applicable), treatment with different antibiotic regimens, or timing of antibiotic therapy (intrapartum and/or postpartum). Therefore, this review assesses trials evaluating intrapartum antibiotics, intrapartum and postpartum antibiotic regimens, and postpartum antibiotics. Diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection was based on standard criteria (clinical/test), and no limit was placed on gestational age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and included a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: Our prespecified primary outcomes were maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal and neonatal severe infection, and duration of maternal and neonatal hospital stay.We included 11 studies (involving 1296 women) and assessed them as having low to moderate risk of bias - mainly because allocation concealment methods were not adequately reported, most studies were open, and outcome reporting was incomplete. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach. The following antibiotics were assessed in the included trials: ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, clindamycin, and cefotetan. During labor: meta-analysis of two studies found no clear differences in rates of neonatal sepsis (163 neonates; risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 2.86; I(2) = 9%; low quality of evidence), treatment failure (endometritis) (163 participants; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.70; I(2) = 0%; low quality of evidence), and postpartum hemorrhage (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.56; I(2) = 0%; low quality of evidence) when two different dosages/regimens of gentamicin were assessed. No clear differences between groups were found for any reported maternal or neonatal outcomes. The review did not identify data for a comparison of antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo. Postpartum: meta-analysis of two studies that evaluated use of antibiotics versus placebo after vaginal delivery showed no significant differences between groups in rates of treatment failure or postpartum endometritis. No significant differences were found in rates of neonatal death and postpartum endometritis when use of antibiotics was compared with no treatment. Four trials assessing two different dosages/regimens of gentamicin or dual-agent therapy versus triple-agent therapy, or comparing antibiotics, found no significant differences in most reported neonatal or maternal outcomes; the duration of hospital stay showed a difference in favor of the group of women who received short-duration antibiotics (one study, 292 women; mean difference (MD) -0.90 days, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.16; moderate quality of evidence). Intrapartum versus postpartum: one small study (45 women) evaluating use of ampicillin/gentamicin during intrapartum versus immediate postpartum treatment found significant differences favoring the intrapartum group in the mean number of days of maternal postpartum hospital stay (one trial, 45 women; MD -1.00 days, 95% CI -1.94 to - 0.06; very low quality of evidence) and the mean number of neonatal hospital stay days (one trial, 45 neonates; MD -1.90 days, 95% CI -3.91 to -0.49; very low quality of evidence). Although no significant differences were found in the rate of maternal bacteremia or early neonatal sepsis, for the outcome of neonatal pneumonia or sepsis we observed a significant difference favoring intrapartum treatment (one trial, 45 neonates; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.95; very low quality of evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review included 11 studies (having low to moderate risk of bias). The quality of the evidence was low to very low for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach. Only one outcome (duration of hospital stay) was considered to provide moderate quality of evidence when antibiotics (short duration) were compared with antibiotics (long duration) during postpartum management of intra-amniotic infection. Our main reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias), imprecision, and inconsistency of results.Currently, limited evidence is available to reveal the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen for the treatment of patients with intra-amniotic infection; whether antibiotics should be continued during the postpartum period; and which antibiotic regimen or what treatment duration should be used. Also, no evidence was found on adverse effects of the intervention (not reported in any of the included studies). One small RCT showed that use of antibiotics during the intrapartum period is superior to their use during the postpartum period in reducing the number of days of maternal and neonatal hospital stay."
19931810,Sepsis redefined: the search for surrogate markers.,2009,"Sepsis is a common and severe medical condition with substantial associated morbidity, mortality and cost. Furthermore, the incidence of sepsis has been rising annually over the past three decades, and morbidity and mortality remain high. The management of sepsis is further complicated by its very heterogeneous nature. This extends not only to the offending pathogens, but also to the nature and severity of the host response as well as its clinical manifestations. Efforts to identify surrogate markers for sepsis have therefore been an ongoing struggle. In this article we present some insights into various sepsis markers through history, presenting advantages and caveats associated with their use and interpretation. We also discuss the state of functional genomics, a relatively recent technological advancement that has already begun to change our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, and offer new directions in the development of a more sensitive and specific sepsis biomarker."
25500308,Evaluation of adaptive immune responses and heterologous protection induced by inactivated bluetongue virus vaccines.,2015,"Eradication of bluetongue virus is possible, as has been shown in several European countries. New serotypes have emerged, however, for which there are no specific commercial vaccines. This study addressed whether heterologous vaccines would help protect against 2 serotypes. Thirty-seven sheep were randomly allocated to 7 groups of 5 or 6 animals. Four groups were vaccinated with commercial vaccines against BTV strains 2, 4, and 9. A fifth positive control group was given a vaccine against BTV-8. The other 2 groups were unvaccinated controls. Sheep were then challenged by subcutaneous injection of either BTV-16 (2 groups) or BTV-8 (5 groups). Taken together, 24/25 sheep from the 4 experimental groups developed detectable antibodies against the vaccinated viruses. Furthermore, sheep that received heterologous vaccines showed significantly reduced viraemia and clinical scores for BTV-16 when compared to unvaccinated controls. Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination."
41497078,Racial and ethnic disparities in utilization of mechanical circulatory support for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective cross-sectional study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is critical in the management of cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but racial/ethnic disparities in MCS utilization remain understudied. METHODS: We extracted data from the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2018 to 2020. Patients aged >/=18 years with AMI and CS listed as primary or secondary diagnosis were identified using ICD-10-CM. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included MCS utilization, hospital length of stay (LOS), total hospital charges, acute kidney injury (AKI)/hemodialysis, and sepsis. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess associations between race/ethnicity and in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Among 89 125 hospitalizations for AMI and CS, Hispanics had lower in-hospital mortality than Whites (OR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96). The MCS use was higher among Asians or Pacific Islanders (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.60) and Hispanics (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30) than among Whites. Hispanics had longer LOS (beta = 1.3 days; 95% CI, 0.78-1.7), whereas Blacks had shorter stays (beta = -0.50 days; 95% CI,-0.91 to -0.10) than Whites. The rates of AKI/hemodialysis were higher among Hispanics (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12-1.42), Blacks (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.40-1.79), and Asians or Pacific Islanders (OR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.18-1.64) than Whites. Sepsis rate was greater among Hispanics (OR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.34). Total hospital charges were higher among Hispanics ($53 770; 95% CI, $39 307-$68 233) and Asians or Pacific Islanders ($33 737; 95% CI, $8954-$58 520), than Whites. CONCLUSION: Racial and ethnic disparities in MCS use and clinical outcomes persist among patients with AMI and CS."
31890225,Serum histone H3 levels and platelet counts are potential markers for coagulopathy with high risk of death in septic patients: a single-center observational study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that anticoagulant therapy does not confer a survival benefit overall in sepsis, but might be beneficial in sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In particular, those with high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores might be the optimal target for anticoagulant therapy. However, both DIC and SOFA scores require the measurement of multiple markers. The purpose of this study was to explore a minimal marker set for determining coagulopathy at high risk of death in septic patients, wherein histone H3 levels were evaluated as indicators of both organ failure and coagulation activation. METHODS: We analyzed correlations among levels of serum histone H3 and other coagulation markers in 85 cases of sepsis using Spearman's rank correlation test. We then compared the utility of histone H3 to that of other coagulation markers in predicting the traditional DIC state or 28-day mortality by receiver-operating characteristics analysis. Finally, we suggested cut-off values for determining coagulopathy with high risk of death, and evaluated their prognostic utility. RESULTS: Serum histone H3 levels significantly correlated with thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) levels (Spearman's rho = 0.46, p < 0.001), and weakly correlated with platelet counts (Spearman's rho = - 0.26, p < 0.05). Compared to other coagulation markers, histone H3 levels showed better performance in predicting 28-day mortality. When combining serum histone H3 levels with platelet counts, our new scoring system showed a concordance rate of 69% with the traditional four-factor criteria of DIC established by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. The 28-day mortality rates of the new and the traditional criteria-positive patients were 43% and 21%, respectively. Those of the new and the traditional criteria-negative patients were 5.7% and 9.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Serum histone H3 levels and platelet counts are potential markers for determining coagulopathy with high risk of death in septic patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the utility of serum histone H3 levels in the diagnostic of coagulopathy/DIC."
18470718,Procalcitonin-a new diagnostic tool in complications following liver transplantation.,2000,"OBJECTIVE: Does procalcitonin (PCT) allow differentiation between infection and rejection following liver transplantation in the case of fever of unknown origin (FUO)? DESIGN: Open prospective trial. SETTING: transplant intensive care unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients after liver transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: Liver biopsy for diagnosis of rejection, transcutaneous aspiration cytology for monitoring of lymphocyte activation. MEASUREMENTS: Procalcitonin from EDTA plasma, APACHE II, Sepsis, score (Elbute and Stoner). RESULTS: Eleven patients suffered an infectious complication resulting in an increase in PCT levels (2.2-41.7 ng/ml). Eleven patients developed a rejection episode; none of these patients showed a rise in PCT levels. The statistical difference between PCT levels in rejection and infection was significant (p<0.05) on the day of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: PCT allows differentiation between rejection and infection in the case of FUO. Elevation of PCT plasma levels develops early postoperatively due to operation trauma, and, in the case of FUO with no rise in PCT, a rejection may be suspected."
25579090,[Nosocomial infection due to Trichosporon asahii in a critical burned patient].,2015,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection is an important cause of morbimortality in patients with severe burns. The advances in burn care therapy have considerably extended the survival of seriously burned patients, exposing them to infectious complications, notably fungal infections, with increased recognition of invasive infections caused by Candida species. However, some opportunistic fungi, like Trichosporon asahii, have emerged as important causes of nosocomial infection. CASE REPORT: A case of nosocomial infection due to T. asahii in a severely ill burned patient successfully treated with voriconazole is presented. The management of invasive fungal infections in burned patients, from diagnosis to selection of the therapeutic protocol, is often a challenge. Early diagnosis and treatment are associated with a better prognosis. In this case report, current treatment options are discussed, and a review of previously published cases is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the difficulty in the diagnosis of invasive mycoses and their high associated mortality rates, it is advisable to keep a high degree of clinical suspicion of trichosporonosis in susceptible patients, including burned patients. The isolation of T. asahii in clinical specimens of this type of host must raise clinical alert, since it may precede an invasive infection."
25544351,Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis.,2015,"Although the pathophysiology of sepsis has been elucidated with the passage of time, sepsis may be regarded as an uncontrolled inflammatory and procoagulant response to infection. The hemostatic changes in sepsis range from subclinical activation of blood coagulation to acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis, which contributes to multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and subsequent consumption of platelets and coagulation factors, eventually causing bleeding manifestations. The diagnosis of DIC can be made using routinely available laboratory tests, scoring algorithms, and thromboelastography. In this cascade of events, the inhibition of coagulation activation and platelet function is conjectured as a useful tool for attenuating inflammatory response and improving outcomes in sepsis. A number of clinical trials of anticoagulants were performed, but none of them have been recognized as a standard therapy because recombinant activated protein C was withdrawn from the market owing to its insufficient efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. However, these subgroup analyses of activated protein C, antithrombin, and thrombomodulin trials show that overt coagulation activation is strongly associated with the best therapeutic effect of the inhibitor. In addition, antiplatelet drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid, P2Y12 inhibitors, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, may reduce organ failure and mortality in the experimental model of sepsis without a concomitant increased bleeding risk, which should be supported by solid clinical data. For a state-of-the-art treatment of sepsis, the efficacy of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents needs to be proved in further large-scale prospective, interventional, randomized validation trials."

31837933,Sepsis Survivors Transitioned to Home Health Care: Characteristics and Early Readmission Risk Factors.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To profile the characteristics of growing numbers of sepsis survivors receiving home healthcare (HHC) by type of sepsis before, during, and after a sepsis hospitalization and identify characteristics significantly associated with 7-day readmission. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Data sources included the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Medicare administrative and claims data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National sample of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for sepsis who were discharged to HHC between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014 (N = 165,228). METHODS: We used an indicator distinguishing among 3 types of sepsis: explicitly coded sepsis diagnosis without organ dysfunction; severe sepsis with organ dysfunction; and septic shock. We compared these subgroups' demographic, clinical and functional characteristics, comorbidities, risk factors for rehospitalization, characteristics of the index hospital stay, and predicted 7-day hospital readmission. RESULTS: The majority (80.7%) had severe sepsis, 5.7% had septic shock, and 13.6% had sepsis without acute organ system dysfunction. The medical diagnoses recorded at HHC admission identified sepsis or blood infection only 7% of the time, potentially creating difficulty identifying the sepsis survivor in HHC. Among sepsis types, septic shock survivors had the greatest illness burden profile. This study describes 12 key variables, each of which individually raises the relative 7-day readmission risk by as much as 60%. Increased risk of 7-day rehospitalization was found among those with septic shock, 3 or more previous inpatient stays, index hospital length of stay of >8 days, dyspnea, >6 functional dependencies, and other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Implications for practice include using our findings to identify sepsis survivors who are at risk for early readmission. Assessment for these factors may profile the at-risk patient, thereby triggering the call for additional acute care intervention such as delayed discharge, or post-acute intervention such as early home visit and outpatient follow-up."
32166288,Retrospective Observational Study of the Clinical Performance Characteristics of a Machine Learning Approach to Early Sepsis Identification.,2019,"To estimate performance characteristics and impact on care processes of a machine learning, early sepsis recognition tool embedded in the electronic medical record. DESIGN: Retrospective review of electronic medical records and outcomes to determine sepsis prevalence among patients about whom a warning was received in real time and timing of that warning compared with clinician recognition of potential sepsis as determined by actions documented in the electronic medical record. SETTING: Acute care, nonteaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients in the emergency department, observation unit, and adult inpatient care units who had sepsis diagnosed either by clinical codes or by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: Management Bundle (SEP-1) criteria for severe sepsis and patients who had machine learning-generated advisories about a high risk of sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Noninterventional study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using two different definitions of sepsis as ""true"" sepsis, we measured the sensitivity and early warning clinical utility. Using coded sepsis to define true positives, we measured the positive predictive value of the early warnings. Sensitivity was 28.6% and 43.6% for coded sepsis and severe sepsis, respectively. The positive predictive value of an alert was 37.9% for coded sepsis. Clinical utility (true positive and earlier advisory than clinical recognition) was 2.2% and 1.6% for the two different definitions of sepsis. Use of the tool did not improve sepsis mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics were different than previously described in this retrospective assessment of real-time warnings. Real-world testing of retrospectively validated models is essential. The early warning clinical utility may vary depending on a hospital's state of sepsis readiness and embrace of sepsis order bundles."
15605912,"Polymicrobial bacteremia caused by Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, and Shewanella putrefaciens.",2004,"Edwardsiella tarda, a member of Enterobacteriaceae, is found in freshwater and marine environments and in animals living in these environments. This bacterium is primarily associated with gastrointestinal diseases, and has been isolated from stool specimens obtained from persons with or without clinical infectious diseases. Shewanella putrefaciens, a saprophytic gram-negative rod, is rarely responsible for clinical syndromes in humans. Debilitated status and exposure to aquatic environments are the major predisposing factors for E. tarda or S. putrefaciens infection. A 61-year-old woman was febrile with diarrhea 8 hours after ingesting shark meat, and two sets of blood cultures grew Escherichia coli, E. tarda and S. putrefaciens at the same time. She was successfully treated with antibiotics. We present this rare case of polymicrobial bacteremia caused by E. coli, E. tarda and S. putrefaciens without underlying disease, which is the first found in Taiwan. This rare case of febrile diarrhea with consequent polymicrobial bacteremia emphasizes that attention should always be extended to these unusual pathogens."
41417340,"Neonatal outcomes associated with maternal arbovirus infection (dengue, Zika, and chikungunya) among pregnant women with obstetric complications in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Arboviruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), pose serious threats to neonatal health; however, the consequences of maternal peripartum infections, particularly those that are asymptomatic, remain poorly characterized. METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study investigated the adverse neonatal outcomes associated with maternal arbovirus infection among pregnant women hospitalized for obstetric complications in Northeast Brazil (October 2018 to May 2019). Maternal and neonatal data were collected through interviews and reviewing medical records. Acute/recent maternal infections were confirmed by molecular or serological assays. Associations between maternal infection (categorized as any arbovirus, ZIKV-only, or CHIKV-only) and neonatal outcomes were assessed using Poisson's regression with robust variance, yielding adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlled for maternal covariates. RESULTS: Among 806 neonates, 131 (16.3%) were born to arbovirus-infected mothers and had a higher prevalence of prematurity (aPR=1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) and sepsis (aPR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.07-2.83) compared with those born to non-infected mothers. Neonates of ZIKV-infected mothers had a two-fold higher prevalence of sepsis (aPR=2.02, 95% CI: 1.00-4.11) than neonates of non-infected mothers, and a trend was observed for CHIKV (aPR=1.76, 95% CI: 0.97-3.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this hyperendemic region, a high frequency of newborns were exposed to maternal arbovirus infection during the inter-epidemic period, which was associated with increased premature births and neonatal sepsis. These findings underscore the need for increased clinical vigilance and routine screening in endemic areas, necessitating further longitudinal studies to confirm causality and guide management."
25709781,Orbital metastasis: a rare manifestation of scapular bone osteosarcoma.,2014,"PURPOSE: To report a case of orbital metastasis from scapular bone osteosarcoma. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old man who was a known case of scapular bone osteosarcoma, was referred to our clinic with ocular symptoms including acute painful decreased vision, proptosis, conjunctival injection, and chemosis. He had undergone surgical excision of the original tumor and received systemic chemotherapy 4 months before. Imaging studies and incisional biopsy were performed for the orbital lesion, the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic osteosarcoma. The patient was referred to the oncologist for palliative chemotherapy and further intervention; however, he deceased 2 months later due to sepsis in the context of immunosuppression. CONCLUSION: Metastatic involvement of the orbit due to osteosarcoma is a rare condition manifesting with orbital mass, pain, diplopia and ocular motility disturbance. Although there is no effective treatment, the combination of modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery may delay progression of the disease."

A healthy man presented with severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever followed by development of multiple blisters, cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis of the lower limbs, who progressed rapidly to fulminant sepsis caused by this organism. Vibrio vulnificus septicaemia should be suspected in the presence of sepsis and progressive soft-tissue infection with recent history of raw seafood consumption."
41590611,Benchtop NMR in Biomedicine: An Updated Literature Overview.,2025,"Background: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool in metabolomics, but it is often hindered by the high cost and technical complexity of the machines, limiting its clinical and point-of-care applications. Recent advances in benchtop NMR technology have sought to overcome these barriers by providing more compact, affordable, and user-friendly instruments. This systematic review aims to assess the potential of benchtop NMR in clinical metabolomics, highlighting its practical advantages, current applications, and technological challenges relative to high-field systems. Methods: For this systematic review we searched Web of Science and PubMed databases to identify studies employing benchtop NMR spectroscopy in clinical and biomedical applications. The review focuses on works that evaluated metabolic profiling in human and animal disease contexts, compared benchtop and high-field performance, and utilized advanced data analysis methods, including multivariate and machine learning approaches. Results: Among the 74 records identified, 15 research articles were eligible, including 11 studies involving human biospecimens and 4 studies concerning animal samples. The selected works were published between 2018 and 2025. These studies demonstrated the potential clinical utility of low-field NMR in differentiating disease states such as tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, neonatal sepsis, and chronic kidney disease, achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to high-field instruments. Conclusions: Although limited by lower sensitivity and spectral resolution, benchtop NMR represents a significant step toward the democratization of NMR-based metabolomics. Continued hardware development, improved pulse sequences, and the integration of artificial intelligence for spectral processing and modeling are expected to enhance its analytical power and accelerate its clinical adoption."
41613598,"Bloodstream infection with NDM-1/5 Enterobacter cloacae complex in China: diverse STs, multi-virulence systems and carbapenem resistance.",2025,"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the molecular epidemiology, virulence repertoire and resistance gene characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (CRECC) in bloodstream infections (BSI), thereby providing evidence for precision therapy and infection control. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 13 non-replicate CRECC-BSI isolates from January 2019 to December 2023 at a tertiary-care hospital in Shandong Province, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution; Illumina NovaSeq whole-genome sequencing was performed, and genomes were assembled with ABySS and GapCloser. ResFinder, VFDB, CGE and NCBI Pathogen Detection databases were used jointly to analyze resistance genes, virulence factors, plasmid replicons, MLST an SNP-based phylogenetic tree assessed inter-strain relatedness; while filter-mating assays determined the transferability of plasmids. RESULTS: A total of 13 CRECC isolates yielded five sequence types (STs), with ST171 predominating (46.2%, 6/13); all carried bla (NDM) (bla (NDM-1) in 9 isolates, bla (NDM-5) in 4), along with AmpC, ESBLs, and aminoglycoside/quinolone resistance genes. The IncX3 plasmid replicon was most frequent (46.2%, 6/13), followed by IncHI2/HI2A (38.5%, 5/13). Each strain harbored adherence, biofilm formation, iron/manganese transport and T6SS virulence genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed complete resistance among all isolates to cephalosporins, carbapenems and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, while amikacin, tigecycline and polymyxin B remained 100% susceptible. cgMLST revealed a polyclonal population structure. Conjugation assays demonstrated transfer of bla (NDM)-bearing plasmids to recipient Escherichia coli J53. CONCLUSIONS: Our institutional CRECC-BSI is characterized by diverse sequence types, a complex plasmid profile and a high burden of virulence genes; ST171 is the dominant clone and bla (NDM-1) the principal carbapenemase. Close surveillance of this high-risk lineage and of IncX3/IncHI2-mediated horizontal gene transfer is essential, together with strengthened infection-control and antimicrobial-stewardship measures."
31813733,The clinical characteristics of Acinetobacter bacteremia differ among genomospecies: A hospital-based retrospective comparative analysis of genotypically identified strains.,2019,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Acinetobacter is an aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus, which causes nosocomial infections including bacteremia. Recent development of molecular techniques has made classification of the Acinetobacter genomospecies possible, but there are still only a few studies comparing clinical features of the subspecies. We investigated bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter, isolated subspecies, and compared clinical features for each group. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of Acinetobacter bacteremia cases was made in a 900-bed hospital in Japan. In addition to conventional procedures, subspecies identification based on rpoB sequence was made, and comparison of clinical characteristics between each subspecies were analyzed. RESULTS: We collected 35 cases (Acinetobacter baumannii 14, A. nosocomialis 12, Acinetobacter ursingii 6, and A. seifertii 3). All of the A. seifertii bacteremia cases were blood stream infection occurring in cerebrovascular disease patients, showing particularly higher incidence of shock (100%) and high Pitt bacteremia score (PBS) (6.33 +/- 2.52) in comparison to A. baumannii (43% and 2.86 +/- 2.25, respectively). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the PBS were slightly higher in A. nosocomialis in comparison to A. baumannii, and the 7 day mortality rate was higher in A. nosocomialis (25%) than in A. baumannii (7%), though this difference was not found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: A.seifertii, the recently defined novel species, showed distinctive clinical features of bacteremia. And, in contrast to previous studies, the severity of A. nosocomialis infection was not lower than that of A. baumannii, which might suggest the influence of local epidemiology. Further characterization of these subspecies should be continued."
41489549,Tea seed-derived leucoside attenuates sepsis via inhibition of TLR4-MD2 complex formation.,2026,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition driven by dysregulated inflammation, remains a major clinical challenge due to high mortality rates and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory properties of Leucoside, a natural flavonoid isolated from tea seed extract, and its potential as a therapeutic agent for sepsis. Using a bacterial infection-induced septic mouse model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages, we demonstrated that Leucoside significantly improves survival rates, reduces hypothermia, and attenuates organ damage by suppressing systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, network pharmacology and molecular docking identified Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a primary target of Leucoside. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that Leucoside competitively binds to conserved positively charged residues in the B patch of TLR4, specifically Lys263 and Arg337, forming a spatial barrier that inhibits the formation of the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2)-TLR4 complex and subsequent nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling. This inhibition was further validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which showed a reduced effect on the TLR4-MD2 complex dissociation when Lys263 and Arg337 were mutated. These findings highlight Leucoside as a novel TLR4 inhibitor with significant potential for treating sepsis and other TLR4-mediated inflammatory diseases. By elucidating its mechanism of action, this study provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies to address the unmet clinical needs in sepsis management."
31836429,Bacterial Endotoxin Activates the Coagulation Cascade through Gasdermin D-Dependent Phosphatidylserine Exposure.,2019,"Excessive activation of the coagulation system leads to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying the activation of coagulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. We found that caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor, activated the coagulation cascade. Caspase-11 enhanced the activation of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of coagulation, through triggering the formation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores and subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure, in a manner independent of cell death. GSDMD pores mediated calcium influx, which induced phosphatidylserine exposure through transmembrane protein 16F, a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase. Deletion of Casp11, ablation of Gsdmd, or neutralization of phosphatidylserine or TF prevented LPS-induced DIC. In septic patients, plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, biomarkers of GSDMD activation, correlated with phosphatidylserine exposure in peripheral leukocytes and DIC scores. Our findings mechanistically link immune recognition of LPS to coagulation, with implications for the treatment of DIC."
31843654,Invasive infections with Fusobacterium necrophorum including Lemierre's syndrome: an 8-year Swedish nationwide retrospective study.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the nationwide incidence and a potential increase in invasive infections with Fusobacterium necrophorum. Secondly, we aimed to describe epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes for the different presentations: Lemierre's syndrome (LS), invasive head and neck-infection without LS and invasive non-head and neck-infection. METHODS: A retrospective multicentric population-based study of all invasive infections with F. necrophorum diagnosed in Sweden from 2010 to 2017 with 6 months of follow-up was performed through reviews of medical records. Invasive infections were defined and identified by a positive blood culture or sequencing of 16S rDNA, targeted PCR or culture from normally sterile sites. Incidence calculations were performed, including comparisons between 2010-13 and 2014-17, age groups and clinical presentations. Patient and infection characteristics, treatment and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Invasive infections with F. necrophorum were diagnosed in 300 cases in Sweden 2010-17. The incidence increased from 2.9 to 5.0 cases/million/year from 2010-13 to 2014-17 (p 0.001). A total of 104/300 (35%) patients developed LS, 102/300 (34%) invasive head and neck infection without LS and 94/300 (31%) invasive non-head and neck infection. The median age was 20, 25 and 64 years, respectively. Among patients with LS 72/96 (75%) had thrombocytopenia on admission, 86/104 (83%) had sepsis, 19/104 (18%) developed septic shock and 45/104 (43%) needed intensive care. 30-day mortality in LS was 2/104 (2%). CONCLUSION: We describe an increased incidence of invasive infections with F. necrophorum in Sweden and highlight its full spectrum of invasive clinical presentations. LS, in particular, causes considerable morbidity in young and previously healthy patients."
15714628,"Hospital admissions syndromic surveillance--Connecticut, September 200-November 2003.",2004,"On September 11, 2001, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH) initiated daily, statewide syndromic surveillance based on unscheduled hospital admissions (HASS). The system's objectives were to monitor for outbreaks caused by Category A biologic agents and evaluate limits in space and time of identified outbreaks. Thirty-two acute-care hospitals were required to report their previous day's unscheduled admissions for 11 syndromes (pneumonia, hemoptysis, respiratory distress, acute neurologic illness, nontraumatic paralysis, sepsis and nontraumatic shock, fever with rash, fever of unknown cause, acute gastrointestinal illness, and possible cutaneous anthrax, and suspected illness clusters). Admissions for pneumonia, gastrointestinal illness, and sepsis were reported most frequently; admissions for fever with rash, possible cutaneous anthrax, and hemoptysis were rare. A method for determining the difference between random and systemic variation was used to identify differences of >/=3 standard deviations for each syndrome from a 6-month moving average. HASS was adapted to meet changing surveillance needs (e.g., surveillance for anthrax, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome). HASS was sensitive enough to reflect annual increases in hospital-admission rates for pneumonia during the influenza season and to confirm an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness. Follow-up of HASS neurologic-admissions reports has led to diagnosis of West Nile virus encephalitis cases. Report validation, syndrome-criteria standardization among hospitals, and expanded use of outbreak-detection algorithms will enhance the system's usefulness."
31910468,Severe Lower Body Swelling and Bacteremia Secondary to Shewanella algae Bacteremia During Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL Training.,2019,"Shewanella algae is a unique bacterium largely documented in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) with a wide range of presentations from gas-producing necrotizing fasciitis to osteomyelitis. Seawater exposure to lower extremity ulcers and wounds is most often correlated with infection, which has been documented in causing complications of bacteremia, sepsis, and infective endocarditis. Further complicating treatment is poor response to most empiric regimens prior to definitive diagnosis and an uneven response to antibiotics, including documented resistance to carbapenem. This case documents the presentation of a Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL (BUD/S) training candidate who presented acutely for complaints of severe lower body swelling and abrasions during ""Hell Week"" and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, and S algae."
20004111,Low-dose erythropoietin aggravates endotoxin-induced organ damage in conscious rats.,2010,"Endotoxin shock can induce the production of several inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, leading to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been found to interact with its receptor (EPO-R), expressed in a wide variety of non-hematopoietic tissues, to induce a range of pleiotropic cytoprotective actions. We investigated the effects of low doses of EPO (300U/kg, intravenous administration) on the physiopathology and cytokine levels in endotoxin shock in conscious rats. Endotoxin shock was induced by intravenous injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (20mg/kg) in conscious rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored for 48h after LPS administration. Levels of biochemical and cytokine parameters, including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 48h after sepsis. Serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta level was measured at 1h after sepsis. Endotoxin shock significantly increased blood GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta levels, and HR, while it decreased MAP. EPO further increased the markers of organ injury (GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, and CPK), inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) and did not affect MAP and HR after LPS. EPO disserved endotoxin shock-induced liver, kidney, lung, and small intestine damage in conscious rats. In conclusion, pre-treatment with low doses of EPO increased the release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, along with aggravating endotoxin shock-induced markers of organ injury in conscious rats."
18250622,[Management of sepsis of the biliary tract: indications to surgical treatment].,2002,"Sepsis of the biliary tract is a severe disease, due to its course and its significant association with relevant diseases, either benign or malignant, of the biliary tract, pancreas, hepatic hilus. In many cases it remains difficult to set the limit between medical therapy, percutaneous or endoscopic therapy and surgical treatment. Through a thorough review of the last 20 years' literature, we have studied this topic and classified cholangitis according to its etiology: Iithiasis, benign stenosis or Klatskin tumor as malignant diseases. The sequential approach, endoscopy-surgery, seems to provide the best results in lithiasic cholangitis. In patients with benign stenosis of the biliary tract, a percutaneous drainage is indicated as a first choice, meanwhile surgery is limited to unsuccessful bilioplasty and to segmental extrahepatic localization of sclerosing cholangitis. On the contrary, in Klatskin tumours preoperative percutaneous drainages are useful to obtain an accurate map, which is indispensable to perform an aggressive radical hepatic resection."
31806416,Association between biomass formation and the prognosis of infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between biomass formation and the clinical characteristics and prognosis of Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS: We prospectively studied 209 S. aureus strains causing IE. Biomass formation was examined using the crystal violet assay and quantified spectrophotometrically. The average (SD) optical density of the biomass was compared for each clinical, microbiological (methicillin-resistance, vancomycin MIC>/=1.5mug/ml) and molecular (clonal complex, agr type and agr dysfunction) variable according to their presence or absence. The primary clinical endpoints studied were in-hospital death, severe sepsis, persistent bacteraemia, symptomatic peripheral embolisms and prosthetic valve IE. RESULTS: Mean age was 66.1 years, 61.5% of patients were male and the median age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index was 5 points (IQR 3-8). In-hospital mortality was 37.3%. Strains belonging to CC5 and CC22 had optical biomass densities [mean (SD) 1.573 (1.14) vs 0.942 (0.98) p<0.001 and 1.720 (0.94) vs 1.028 (1.04) p=0.001, respectively]. Strains belonging to CC5 and CC22 had significantly higher optical biomass densities [1.369 (1.18) vs 0.920 (0.93) p=0.008]. No statistically significant differences were found in the clinical endpoints studied. CONCLUSIONS: High biomass production was associated with CC5 and CC22 but not with higher hospital mortality, septic complications, type of endocarditis, methicillin-resistance, elevated vancomycin MIC or agr dysfunction."
15692717,"Follow-up evaluation of children with birth weight less than or equal to 2,000 g.",2004,"CONTEXT: During the first year of life, the growth process is highly vulnerable to several impairing factors that need to be understood. OBJECTIVE: To perform follow-up evaluation on newborns weighing less than or equal to 2,000 g in a population of low socioeconomic level. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective. SETTING: Hospital Maternidade Escola de Vila Nova Cachoeirinha, Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The study included 60 children born between March 1996 and January 1998, weighing less than or equal to 2,000 g. They were divided into three subgroups, according to birth weight and adequacy for gestational age. The factors studied were maternal variables, illnesses among the newborns, hospital admissions subsequent to discharge from the nursery, and the evolution of weight from birth until 12 months of life. Statistical analyses were performed through application of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V.9.0 and Curve Expert 1.3 programs. RESULTS: Previous maternal diseases occurred in 38.6% of the pregnant women and intercurrent events occurred in 100%. The prevailing neonatal diseases were sepsis (30%) and hyaline membrane disease (25%). There were 404 visits on an outpatient basis: the most frequently diagnosed complaints related to respiratory diseases (26%). Among visits to specialists, 81.7% were to the neuropediatrician. A diagnosis of normality was made for 80% of all visits, for all specialties. For each of these groups, a growth curve was established. These were shown to be below the reference curve standards, with such differences least evident with regard to the children's corrected age. DISCUSSION: The severity of the newborns'conditions may be related to the high incidence of maternal diseases prior to pregnancy as well as intercurrent events during pregnancy. The differences in growth in relation to NCHS charts show that corrected age should be used as a parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic conditions, clinical/obstetric events and newborn diseases during the hospital stay had repercussions on these children's progress during their first year of life. Their growth profile was found to be very far from the reference standard, thus indicating a need for constant, differentiated assessment."
41413004,P23 Scurvy presenting as an unusual petechial rash in a patient with anorexia nervosa.,2025,"An 18-year-old girl with extreme anorexia nervosa (BMI 13 kg/m2, 37.9 kilograms) was admitted for nutritional stabilisation. She reported a two-week history of abdominal pain, reduced urine output and a widespread rash on her abdomen, arms and legs. She appeared cachectic, drowsy, dehydrated and unwell. She was empirically started on intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected intra-abdominal sepsis. She had cutaneous signs of anorexia nervosa including pale skin with lanugo hair and xerosis, angular stomatitis, dry, listless, thin hair and calluses over the knuckles from self-induced vomiting (Russell sign). A non-blanching petechial and purpuric rash covered the peri-umbilical area, forearms and shins. Corkscrew hairs and perifollicular haemorrhages were visible on her shins. Laboratory tests including clotting were normal apart from mild renal impairment and severe hypophosphataemia. Ultrasound scan of the urinary tract, non-contrast full body CT scan, throat swab, peripheral blood and urine cultures were unremarkable. A 5 mm punch biopsy from the rash on the abdomen showed extensive fresh, pan-dermal interstitial haemorrhage in keeping with purpura, with no evidence of vasculopathy or active inflammation. This led to a diagnosis of scurvy secondary to anorexia nervosa. She received nasogastric feeding and IV phosphate replacement for refeeding syndrome. Treatment with IV Pabrinex, which contains 500 milligrams of Vitamin C in each No. 2 ampoule, achieved a dramatic resolution of the rash within a week. Our case of atypical scurvy presenting without the classical gingival signs highlights the importance of clinical examination and dietary history in malnourished, unwell patients presenting with a petechial rash."
31812344,Dimorphic effect of 17beta-oestradiol on pathology and oxidative stress in experimental malaria.,2020,"Malaria is the parasitic disease with the highest mortality worldwide; males exhibit higher mortality and more severe symptomatology than females, suggesting the participation of sexual hormones in protection and pathology. We have documented that gonadectomy modifies oxidative stress in Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected mice in a dimorphic manner. However, gonadectomy decreases all sexual steroids levels, making it difficult to determine the contribution of each hormone to the results. This study aimed to explore the participation of 17beta-oestradiol (E2) in oxidative stress in the blood, spleen, liver and brain of P. berghei-infected female and male mice. E2 was administered to intact or gonadectomized (GX) male and female mice to assess their effects on parasitaemia, body weight loss and hypothermia. We also measured the effect of E2 on the specific activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and on malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the blood, spleen, liver and brain of CBA/Ca male and female mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. We detected the effects of E2 and sexual dimorphism on all tissues and variables analysed. Administration of E2 increased parasitaemia in intact mice. However, reconstitution of GX female mice with E2 decreased parasitaemia. E2 decreased body weight and differentially modulated oxidative stress depending on the sex, infection and tissue analysed. Low antioxidant activity was detected in the brain, suggesting additional protective antioxidant mechanisms in the brain independent of antioxidant enzymes. Our results explained, at least in part, the sexual dimorphism in this experimental model of malaria."
15776895,[Urinary stones in subjects over the age of sixty].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: Urinary stones, affecting 10% of the French population, is a frequent disease. Data of the literature on this disease in subjects over the age of 60 years reveal age-related changes of risk factors, especially affecting urine composition, but very few data have been reported concerning the clinical characteristics of the disease. Due to the absence of recent data on urinary stones in subjects over the age of 60 in France, we decided to study the epidemiology and urological treatment of urinary stones in the elderly in France. MATERIAL AND METHOD: From November 2001 to August 2002, a survey concerning urinary stones in subjects over the age of 60 was performed by the Association Francaise d'Urologie Stone Committee among urologist members of the AFU. The parameters studied were epidemiological, clinical, metabolic and therapeutic. The results were analysed on the overall patient population and on the subgroup of patients over the age of 70. RESULTS: The study included 176 patients over the age of 60, 110 of whom were over the age of 70. These patients presented their first episode of urinary stones in 41% of cases. Renal colic was the most frequent presenting symptom. Signs of severity were frequently associated, with urinary tract infection in 24% of cases, associated with sepsis in 49% of cases after the age of 70 years. The incidence of uric acid stones was higher than in the general population. CONCLUSION: Urinary stones can often occur for the first time after the age of 60. This disease appears to be more serious than in the general population due to the high incidence of infectious complications. Uric stones also appear to be more frequent. A multidisciplinary study based on a larger population is necessary to confirm these results."
41669126,"Evaluation of procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in children in Owerri, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Timely diagnosis remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional blood culture. This study evaluates procalcitonin as a biomarker for bacterial sepsis in children aged 0-59 months in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2023 and February 2024. It involved 298 children aged 0-59 months with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) who were admitted to the Emergency Pediatric Unit and Special Care Baby Unit of Federal Teaching Hospital, Owerri. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured using ELISA, and blood cultures were processed using the BacT/Alert system. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of procalcitonin were compared against blood culture results. RESULTS: Of the 298 children, 142 (47.7%) had culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of serum procalcitonin were 66.9%, 89.7%, 85.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for serum procalcitonin was 0.80 across all age groups which were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin has a good diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial sepsis in children and can complement blood culture in resource-limited settings. Further studies are recommended to explore its application in routine clinical practice."
19931819,Microbiological patterns in sepsis: what happened in the last 20 years?,2009,"Changes in the microbiological characteristics of sepsis have been observed over the past few decades. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become more common in some areas, possibly as a consequence of the increased use of intravascular and other medical devices, an increase in invasive procedures and the use of immunosuppressant agents. As observed with other infections there has been an emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Most of the published data come from wealthy countries in temperate climates, and although many of the same changes have been observed in developing countries, there are important regional differences in the microbiology of sepsis. For example, typhoidal salmonellae remain the most important cause of bloodstream infection in parts of South Asia, nontyphoidal salmonella infections are predominant in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and melioidosis is important in endemic areas. The microbiological pattern of sepsis has also been influenced by the rise in prevalence of HIV infection in many regions."
25549491,[Independent lung ventilation for asymmetric injury: case report as a demonstration of common challenge].,2014,"The article deals with a case of conventional mechanical ventilation in 75 y.o. woman with the background of uncompensated diabetes mellitus, suffering from bilateral pneumonia with predominantly left-sided lesion and severe sepsis. The conventional mechanical ventilation with high pressure levels led to arterial hypoxemia with P/F ratio 52. Independent lung ventilation immediately increased oxygenation up to P/F ratio 225 and evidently improved left lung aeration. The case demonstrates that while applying high pressures to open alveoli, we could not only provoke ventilator-induced lung injury and low cardiac output, but also ""squeeze out"" pulmonary perfusion from ventilated areas to non-ventilated ones with less intraalveolar pressure levels."
15640628,Efficacy and safety of the monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody F(ab')2 fragment afelimomab in patients with severe sepsis and elevated interleukin-6 levels.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether administration of afelimomab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody fragment, would reduce 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and elevated serum levels of IL-6. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-center, phase III clinical trial. SETTING: One hundred fifty-seven intensive care units in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Subjects were 2,634 patients with severe sepsis secondary to documented infection, of whom 998 had elevated interleukin-6 levels. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were stratified into two groups by means of a rapid qualitative interleukin-6 test kit designed to identify patients with serum interleukin-6 levels above (test positive) or below (test negative) approximately 1000 pg/mL. Of the 2,634 patients, 998 were stratified into the test-positive group, 1,636 into the test-negative group. They were then randomly assigned 1:1 to receive afelimomab 1 mg/kg or placebo for 3 days and were followed for 28 days. The a priori population for efficacy analysis was the group of patients with elevated baseline interleukin-6 levels as defined by a positive rapid interleukin-6 test result. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the group of patients with elevated interleukin-6 levels, the mortality rate was 243 of 510 (47.6%) in the placebo group and 213 of 488 (43.6%) in the afelimomab group. Using a logistic regression analysis, treatment with afelimomab was associated with an adjusted reduction in the risk of death of 5.8% (p = .041) and a corresponding reduction of relative risk of death of 11.9%. Mortality rates for the placebo and afelimomab groups in the interleukin-6 test negative population were 234 of 819 (28.6%) and 208 of 817 (25.5%), respectively. In the overall population of interleukin-6 test positive and negative patients, the placebo and afelimomab mortality rates were 477 of 1,329 (35.9%)and 421 of 1,305 (32.2%), respectively. Afelimomab resulted in a significant reduction in tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 levels and a more rapid improvement in organ failure scores compared with placebo. The safety profile of afelimomab was similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Afelimomab is safe, biologically active, and well tolerated in patients with severe sepsis, reduces 28-day all-cause mortality, and attenuates the severity of organ dysfunction in patients with elevated interleukin-6 levels."
31917133,Ignorance of pre-ED healthcare setting is a factor leading to inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment of sepsis in ED and poor outcomes in ICU.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Appropriate initial antibiotic therapy is critical for successfully treating sepsis. In the emergency department (ED), clinicians often rely on septic symptoms to guide empirical therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether history of contacting pre-ED healthcare setting is easy to be neglected and whether the patients received more inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy and developed poorer outcomes. METHODS: Septic patients (n = 453) admitted from ED to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively selected. Appropriate antibiotic treatment or not was determined by checking whether the selected antibiotics can effectively eradicate the bacteria identified. Various indexes were compared between patients with appropriate and inappropriate initial antibiotic treatments, including septic symptoms (qSOFA scores) in ED, septic-severity change in ICU (SOFA-score ratios), and septic outcomes (APACHE II scores, stay length, 30-day survival probability). These indexes were also compared between pre-ED healthcare and pre-ED community patients. RESULTS: In comparison with pre-ED community patients, pre-ED healthcare patients received more inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment in ED, showing poorer outcomes in ICU, including septic severity, stay-lengths in ICU and 30-day survival probabilities. Pre-ED settings is more significant than qSOFA scores to predict the inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ED healthcare settings, which are indexes for infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens, are easy to be neglected in the first hour in ED. We suggested that standard operating procedure for getting enough information of pre-ED settings should be incorporated to the 1 h bundle of sepsis guideline."
25616587,The role of inferior vena cava diameter in volume status monitoring; the best sonographic measurement method?,2015,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the site of and the best sonographic method for measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter in volume status monitoring. METHODS: This observational before-and-after study was performed at the intensive care unit of the emergency department. It included hypotensive adult patients with suspected sepsis who were recommended to receive at least 20 mg/kg fluid replacement by the emergency physician. The patients were fluid replaced at a rate of 1000 mL/h, and maximum and minimum IVC diameters were measured and the Caval index calculated sonographically via both B-mode and M-mode. Hence, IVC's volume response was assessed by a total of 6 parameters, 3 each in M-mode and B-mode. Freidman test was used to assess the change in IVC diameter with fluid replacement. Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction was used to determine which measurement method more sensitively measured IVC diameter change. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with a mean age of 71.3 were included in the final analysis.The IVC diameter change was significant with all 6 methods (P < .001). The IVC minimum diameter change measured on M-mode during inspiration (M-mode i) was the only measurement method that significantly showed diameter change with each 500-mL fluid replacements. The initial and the subsequent M-mode i values after each 500 mL of fluid were 5.65 +/- 3.34; 8.05 +/- 3.66; 10.16 +/- 3.61, and 11.21 +/- 2.94, respectively (P < .001, P < .002, and P < .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Inferior vena cava diameter was changed by fluid administration. The M-mode i method that most sensitively measures that change may be the most successful method in volume status monitoring."
19954476,Angiopoietin balance in septic shock patients treated by direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin b-immobilized fiber.,2009,"Capillary permeability is a tightly regulated feature of microcirculation in all organ beds; however, in sepsis this feature is fundamentally altered. We previously reported elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1) in patients with septic shock, then investigated two kinds of angiopoietins in those patients. An enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to measure serum angiopoietin-1 and -2 levels in 12 patients with septic shock who were treated by direct hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (DHP-PMX). The angiopoietin-1 level was lower in patients with septic shock (7.01 +/- 10.08 ng/mL) than in controls (28.24 +/- 11.61 ng/mL, P < 0.001), but the angiopoietin-2 level was higher in septic shock patients (40.83 +/- 30.13 ng/mL vs. 2.47 +/- 1.78 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Between seven survivors and five non-survivors there was no significant difference in angiopoietin-1 levels before DHP-PMX therapy. During DHP-PMX therapy, however, the angiopoietin-2 level was significantly decreased in survivors (31.52 +/- 26.15 ng/mL vs. 17.32 +/- 22.46 ng/mL, P = 0.035). Moreover, at the end of the therapy, the angiopoietin-1 level was significantly lower in non-survivors (1.14 +/- 1.30 ng/mL vs. 10.43 +/- 13.56 ng/mL, P = 0.042), but the angiopoietin-2 level in non-survivors was significantly higher (70.79 +/- 40.47 ng/mL vs. 17.32 +/- 22.46 ng/mL, P = 0.019). The angiopoietin-2 level may be associated with vascular permeability in septic patients, and angiopoietins may be suitable markers of disease severity and mortality."
15662750,[Mucormycosis].,2004,"Over recent years the clinical importance of invasive fungal infections has significantly increased. Mucormycosis refers to a rare, life threatening, opportunistic disease caused by filamentous fungi of the order Mucorales. Most frequently mucormycosis occurs in patients with ketoacidotic diabetes and in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia. This study of fifteen patients was conducted to evaluate the clinical characteristics of invasive mucormycosis, and goal was also to propose for an early diagnosis and management as survival can only be improved by aggressive surgery and antifungal therapy. In a retrospective analysis of the biopsy and autopsy records of the Department of Pathology at Szent Laszlo Hospital between 1992-2003 were evaluated fifteen histologically documented cases of mucormycosis. The underlying diseases were hematological malignancy with neutropenia in ten cases, chronic leukaemia with neutropenia, chronic leukaemia with latent diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus one case each. Three cases did not belong to any typical risk group. An in vivo diagnosis was made only in four patients with a rhinocerebral manifestation. Radical necrectomy and long-term antifungal therapy cured two of them. Two patients died of a generalised infection despite therapy. None of the systemic infections could be cured. The diagnosis was made post mortem in eleven patients. Selected clinical forms of mucormycosis are illustrated with short case reports."
33094111,Risky Business: Predicting patient mortality at a glance.,2019,"Clinicians are constantly forecasting patient trajectories to make critical point of care decisions intended to influence clinical outcomes. Little is known, however, about how providers interpret mortality risk against validated scoring systems. This research aims to understand how providers forecast mortality specifically for that of patients with sepsis. Defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, sepsis is commonly hard to diagnose, progresses rapidly, and lacks a ""gold standard"" test. Participants were nurses and doctors from the general medical and surgical floors of six different hospitals. Each was presented with ten different patient cases, categorized into low and high severity sepsis, and were asked about care decisions, along with estimations of mortality risk. The resulting data provides a unique look into the differences of risk forecasting between profession and patient severity."
41477766,Aromatic microbial metabolite hippuric acid enhances inflammatory responses in macrophages via TLR-MyD88 signaling and lipid remodeling.,2026,"The gut microbiome produces diverse metabolites shaping immunity, yet their pro-inflammatory potential remains unclear. Using untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, we identified hippuric acid-an aromatic, microbe-derived metabolite-as a potent enhancer of inflammatory responses during Escherichia coli infection. Hippuric acid administration heightened inflammation, activated innate immune cells, and reduced survival in infected mice. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] or LPS+interferon gamma [IFNgamma]) macrophage pro-inflammatory responses but had no effect on M2-like (interleukin [IL]-4) polarization. It enhanced responses to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands but not TRIF-, STING-, or NOD2-mediated stimuli. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abolished hippuric-acid-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed increased cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid accumulation, while reducing cellular cholesterol blunted the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid. Notably, hippuric acid also enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with sepsis mortality, linking microbial metabolism, lipid remodeling, and innate immunity."
15613025,Tissue factor haploinsufficiency during endotoxin induced coagulation and inflammation in mice.,2004,"Intervention studies blocking tissue factor (TF) driven coagulation show beneficial effects on survival in endotoxemia models by reducing cytokine production. It is unknown, however, if moderately reduced TF levels influence endotoxemia. The objective was to investigate whether TF haploinsufficiency reduces endotoxin-induced cytokine production in murine cells or in mice. We analyzed the intrinsic capacity of heterozygous TF deficient (TF+/-) leukocytes to produce cytokines. In addition, we determined the consequences of TF haploinsufficiency on endotoxin-induced inflammation during murine endotoxemia. Endotoxin induced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) in both whole blood and macrophages. Heterozygous TF deficiency reduced endotoxin induced IL-6 and KC levels about two-fold, while TNF-alpha levels were indistinguishable between TF+/- and wild-type cells. In vivo, endotoxin induced a biphasic coagulant response and significant increases in cytokine levels. Surprisingly, both the inflammatory and the coagulant responses were indistinguishable between wild-type and TF+/- mice. At baseline tissues of TF+/- mice showed a 50% reduction in TF activity compared to wild type. Upon endotoxin administration, TF activity increased and the difference between TF+/- and wild-type mice disappeared after 4 h. After 12 h the baseline difference in TF activity was re-established. TF deficiency reduces cytokine production in vitro, but an enhanced induction of TF during murine endotoxemia eliminates this effect in vivo."
25534234,Simvastatin attenuates sepsis-induced blood-brain barrier integrity loss.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress are crucial in mediating blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity loss during sepsis. Simvastatin possess potent anti-inflammation and antioxidation capacity. We sought to elucidate whether an acute bolus of simvastatin could mitigate BBB integrity loss in a rodent model of polymicrobial sepsis. METHODS: A total of 96 adult male rats (200-250 g) were randomized to receive cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), CLP plus simvastatin, sham operation, or sham operation plus simvastatin (n = 24 in each group). After maintaining for 24 h, BBB integrity in the surviving rats was determined. RESULTS: CLP significantly induced BBB integrity loss, as grading of Evans blue staining of the brains, BBB permeability to Evans blue dye, and brain edema levels in rats receiving CLP were significantly higher than those receiving sham operation. In contrast, grading of Evans blue staining (P = 0.020), BBB permeability to Evans blue dye (P = 0.031), and brain edema levels (P = 0.009) in rats receiving CLP plus simvastatin were significantly lower than those receiving CLP alone. Tight junction proteins claudin-3 and claudin-5 in endothelial cells are major structural components of BBB. Our data revealed that concentrations of claudin-3 and claudin-5 in rats receiving CLP were significantly lower than those receiving CLP plus simvastatin (P = 0.010 and 0.007). Immunohistochemistry further revealed significant fragmentation of claudin-3 and claudin-5 in rats receiving CLP. Moreover, levels of claudin-3 and claudin-5 fragmentation in rats receiving CLP plus simvastatin were significantly lower than those receiving CLP. CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin mitigates BBB integrity loss in a rodent model of polymicrobial sepsis."
25526763,Prevalence of community-acquired bacteraemia in Guinea-Bissau: an observational study.,2014,"BACKGROUND: The burden of bloodstream infections is insufficiently studied in children in Africa and many healthcare facilities lack the capacity to identify invasive disease. Often studies have been limited to febrile patients or patients admitted to hospital. METHODS: Blood cultures and malaria diagnostics was performed on 372 consecutive children presenting with tachycardia and/or fever to a referral paediatric emergency department in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Bacterial species detection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing were performed. The capacity of clinical parameters to identify bacteraemia was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of bloodstream infection was 12% (46/372) and in 46% (21/46) of the infections the child was non-febrile at presentation to the hospital. The predictive value for bacteraemia was poor for all assessed clinical parameters. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 54% (26/48) of the isolates followed by non-typhoidal Salmonella, 10% (5/48), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8% (4/48), and Salmonella Typhi, 6% (3/48). Among S. aureus there was a large diversity of spa types and 38% produced Pantone-Valentine leukocidin. Antibiotic resistance was low, however two out of three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Malaria was laboratory confirmed in only 5% of the children but 64% (237/372) received a clinical malaria diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemia was common irrespective of the presence of fever among children presenting to the hospital. The high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus may be due to contamination. There is an imminent need to improve microbiological diagnostic facilities and to identify algorithms that can identify children at risk of bloodstream infections in Africa."
31867010,Monocyte Based Correlates of Immune Activation and Viremia in HIV-Infected Long-Term Non-Progressors.,2019,"Background: Disease progression monitoring through CD4 counts alone can be inadequate in HIV infection as ongoing immune activation may result in Serious non-AIDS events (SNAEs). SNAEs involve monocyte activation driven chronic inflammation with significant sequelae observed even during HAART. Here, we attempted to delineate functional monocyte based signatures across stages of HIV disease progression. Methods: Participants spanning four cohorts were recruited-pre-ART (PA; <7 years of infection; n = 20), long-term non-progressors (LTNP; >7 years of infection, CD4 > 350 cells/muL, n = 20), individuals on therapy (ART; n = 18) and seronegative controls (SN; n = 15). Immunophenotyping of monocyte subsets and evaluation of expression of HIV-binding receptors-CD4 and CCR5, marker of immune activation- HLA-DR and M2 phenotype-mannose receptor (CD206) was followed by association of monocyte-specific parameters with conventional markers of disease progression such as absolute CD4 count, CD4/CD8 ratio, viral load, and T cell activation. Results: A significant expansion of intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+) with a concomitant decline in classical subset (CD14++CD16-) was observed in all infected cohorts compared to seronegative controls. In addition, an expansion of the non-classical subset (CD14+CD16++) was observed in long-term non-progressors. Dysregulation in monocyte subsets associated with CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio in PAs but not in LTNPs. We report for the first time that expression of CD206 is most prominent on intermediate monocytes which also have the highest expression of CD4, CCR5, and HLA-DR. Despite preserved CD4 counts, LTNPs had similar immune activation profiles to PAs, as evidenced by elevated HLA-DR expression across monocyte subsets. HLA-DR expression, similar to that in SNs, observed in the ART group indicated partial immune restoration within the monocyte compartment. Increased CD206 expression on monocytes together with frequency of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes (HLA-DR+CD38+) showed significant and positive association with viral load in LTNPs, but not PAs. Conclusion: Our results describe for the first time the presence of monocyte dysregulation involving increased activation in LTNPs, who, in spite of preserved CD4 counts, may remain susceptible to prolonged effects of systemic inflammation and highlight CD206, as a unique non-T correlate of viremia, in viremic non-progression."
25502152,EMS patients and walk-in patients presenting with severe sepsis: differences in management and outcome.,2014,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a significant problem. The differences between patients with sepsis who walk into the emergency department (ED) and those who are transported via emergency medical services (EMS) have not been clarified. The aim of the study was to determine whether there was a difference in outcome between patients arriving by EMS and those presenting directly to the ED. METHODS: We prospectively collected and reviewed a cohort of all cases of severe sepsis and septic shock admitted to the medical intensive care unit from the ED from November 2009 to March 2012. Extracted data were basic demographic information (including mode of ED arrival), clinical data, and treatments. We calculated Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The primary outcome was mortality in severely ill patients with sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 378 subjects (78%) presented by EMS and 107 subjects were walk-in patients (22%). Patients transported via EMS were older (P < 0.01), had fewer lactates >4 (P < 0.02), a more altered mental status (P < 0.01), and higher respiratory rates (P < 0.05) than did walk-in patients. Patients transported by EMS had worse disease severity when measured by an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (P < 0.01) but not by SOFA score. EMS patients had a shorter time to receiving antibiotics (P = 0.02) and central line placement (P < 0.01) than did walk-in patients. In a logistic model, mortality was associated with increasing age (adjusted odds ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.4), higher first-measured ED lactates (1.2; 95% CI 1.1-1.2), and increased initial SOFA score (adjusted odds ratio 1.2; 95% CI 1.1-1.3) but not EMS arrival or prehospital fluids. CONCLUSIONS: Neither arrival by EMS nor fluid administration by EMS is associated with decreased mortality in severe sepsis."
41596113,"Phagocyte NADPH Oxidase NOX2-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Antimicrobial Defense: Mechanisms, Regulation, and Therapeutic Potential-A Narrative Review.",2025,"ROS derived from NADPH oxidase, particularly NOX2, are central to antimicrobial defense, coupling direct pathogen killing with redox signaling that shapes inflammation. This narrative review integrates recent advances on NOX2 structure, assembly, and spatiotemporal control in phagocytes, and outlines how ROS interact with NF-kappaB, MAPK, and Nrf2 networks to coordinate microbicidal activity and immune modulation. We summarize evidence that both ROS deficiency, as in chronic granulomatous disease, and uncontrolled excess, as in sepsis and severe COVID-19, drive clinically significant pathology, emphasizing the need for precise redox balance. Emerging therapeutic strategies include selective NOX2 inhibitors that limit pathological oxidative bursts, redox-modulating peptides that disrupt upstream activation cues, and Nrf2 activators that enhance endogenous antioxidant capacity, with attention to dosing challenges that preserve host defense while mitigating tissue injury. Key gaps remain in biomarker standardization, real-time in vivo ROS monitoring, and translation from animal models to patients, motivating personalized, combination approaches to redox medicine in infectious diseases."
20017915,A new miniaturized system for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adult respiratory failure.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Mortality of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults is still unacceptably high. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could represent an important treatment option, if complications were reduced by new technical developments. METHODS: Efficiency, side effects and outcome of treatment with a new miniaturized device for veno-venous extracorporeal gas transfer were analysed in 60 consecutive patients with life-threatening respiratory failure. RESULTS: A rapid increase of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) from 64 (48 to 86) mmHg to 120 (84 to 171) mmHg and a decrease of PaCO2 from 63 (50 to 80) mmHg to 33 (29 to 39) mmHg were observed after start of the extracorporeal support (P < 0.001). Gas exchange capacity of the device averaged 155 (116 to 182) mL/min for oxygen and 210 (164 to 251) mL/min for carbon dioxide. Ventilatory parameters were reduced to a highly protective mode, allowing a fast reduction of tidal volume from 495 (401 to 570) mL to 336 (292 to 404) mL (P < 0.001) and of peak inspiratory pressure from 36 (32 to 40) cmH2O to 31 (28 to 35) cmH2O (P < 0.001). Transfusion requirements averaged 0.8 (0.4 to 1.8) units of red blood cells per day. Sixty-two percent of patients were weaned from the extracorporeal system, and 45% survived to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with a new miniaturized device supports gas transfer effectively, allows for highly protective ventilation and is very reliable. Modern ECMO technology extends treatment opportunities in severe lung failure."
25713883,Sixteen consecutive adult intestinal transplantation: a single-center clinical experience in China.,2014,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the paper is to describe a single-center experience of adult small intestine transplantation (ITx). METHODOLOGY: 15 ITx and 1 combined liver and ITx(L/ITx) had performed. The immunosuppressive regimen was based on induction therapy with two different protocols: In Period I (pre-2006, n=10), daclizumab or without for induction, high dose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids as maintenance therapy; In Period II (post-2006, n=6), alemtuzumab for induction and low dose tacrolimus as maintenance anti-rejection treatment unless required for, steroids were not routinely used. RESULTS: In Period I, 9 ITx and 1 L/ITx were performed. One patient survived more than 1-year with normal bowel function and 1 recipient survived more than 4 years with partial PN. Seven patients died within one year. The main cause of death was sepsis. In period II, 4 patients have a normal bowel function with a regular diet without PN, while 2 patients are on partial PN. The main cause of death was rejection. CONCLUSION: The survival of intestinal transplantation has greatly improved over time as management strategies evolved. However, certain unresolved issues still requires future investigation include new strategies to prevent late complications and the causes."
31820849,Cause-specific neonatal morbidity and mortality in the Solomon Islands: An assessment of data from four hospitals over a three-year period.,2020,"AIM: Data on stillbirths and neonatal morbidity and mortality in low-middle income Pacific Island Nations such as Solomon Islands is limited, partly due to weak health information systems. We describe the perinatal mortality and clinical factors associated with poor newborn outcomes at four hospitals in Solomon Islands. METHODS: This was a registry based retrospective cohort study at three provincial hospitals and the National Referral Hospital (NRH) from 2014-2016 inclusive. RESULTS: 23 966 labour ward births and 3148 special care nursery (SCN) admissions were reviewed. Overall still birth rate was 29.2/1000 births and the perinatal mortality rate was 35.9/1000 births. PNMR were higher in provincial hospitals (46.2, 44.0 and 34.3/1000) than at NRH (33.3/1000). The commonest reasons for admission to SCN across the hospitals were sepsis, complications of prematurity and birth asphyxia. SCN mortality rates were higher in the 3 provincial hospitals than at NRH (15.9% (95/598) vs. 7.9% (202/2550), P value <0.01). At NRH, the conditions with the highest case fatality rates were birth asphyxia (21.3%), congenital abnormalities (17.7%), and prematurity (15.1%). Up to 11% of neonates did not have a diagnosis recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The perinatal mortality rates are high and intrapartum complications, prematurity and sepsis are the main causes of morbidity and mortality for neonates at hospitals in Solomon Islands. Stillbirths account for 81% of perinatal deaths. These results are useful for planning for quality improvement at provincial level. Improved vital registration systems are required to better capture stillbirths and neonatal outcomes."
31884847,Multicenter validation of a machine-learning algorithm for 48-h all-cause mortality prediction.,2020,"In order to evaluate mortality predictions based on boosted trees, this retrospective study uses electronic medical record data from three academic health centers for inpatients 18 years or older with at least one observation of each vital sign. Predictions were made 12, 24, and 48 hours before death. Models fit to training data from each institution were evaluated using hold-out test data from the same institution, and from the other institutions. Gradient-boosted trees (GBT) were compared to regularized logistic regression (LR) predictions, support vector machine (SVM) predictions, quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). For training and testing GBT on data from the same institution, the average AUROCs were 0.96, 0.95, and 0.94 across institutional test sets for 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. When trained and tested on data from different hospitals, GBT AUROCs achieved up to 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96, for 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. Average AUROC for 48-hour predictions for LR, SVM, MEWS, and qSOFA were 0.85, 0.79, 0.86 and 0.82, respectively.

15583295,Epidemiology and typing of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bloodstream infections.,2004,"We carried out an epidemiological study covering 2,365,067 patient days of hospitalization between 2000 and 2003. During this time, 413 Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections occurred. This corresponds to 15% of the 2,676 bloodstream infections observed during this period in the 31 hospitals in our region of France, which has 2.5 million inhabitants. The incidence of nosocomial S. aureus bloodstream infections was 0.11 per 1,000 days of hospitalization. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, of which 13% were nonmultiresistant MRSA (NORSA), was 33%, and this percentage was stable over the 4 years. In contrast, the prevalence of S. aureus strains susceptible to methicillin but resistant to quinolones or susceptible to methicillin but multiresistant to antibiotics (EMSSA strains) increased from 4% in 2000 to 23% in 2003. As previously reported, MRSA strains were mostly recovered from nosocomial bloodstream infections, whereas NORSA strains-generally considered to be responsible for community-acquired infections-were always isolated from nosocomial bloodstream infections. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of 109 MRSA strains and 15 EMSSA strains demonstrated clonal diffusion of the three major French MRSA clones and revealed considerable genetic heterogeneity among EMSSA strains. Although no epidemiologically related NORSA strains clustered in particular PFGE groups, the distribution of MRSA strains isolated from bloodstream infections according to the portal of entry (vascular devices, pulmonary, and urinary) was not random for the major PFGE clones, suggesting that each MRSA lineage displays particular virulence features."
25671096,Elizabethkingia Meningoseptica Engodenous Endophthalmitis - a case report.,2014,"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a nosocomial non-fermenting gram-negative bacillus that has an increasing prevalence in health care settings, especially in intensive care environments. While it has long been recognized as a rare but serious cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis, its role as a cause of ocular pathology is not well-known. We report the first case of E. meningoseptica endogenous endophthalmitis caused by bacteraemia by the same organism. In view of its aggressiveness and virulence in the eye, and the high rate of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis especially given its low incidence, we may wish to consider screening all cases of E. menigoseptica bloodstream infections for endophthalmitis in future, similar to how it has become routine to refer all patients with Klebsiella bacteraemia to ophthalmologists for screening for endophthalmitis in our local hospitals."
31887457,Successful treatment of meningococcal bacteremia using oral doxycycline: A case report.,2020,"We report the case of an 18-year-old immunocompetent man who presented to the hospital with fever, headaches, and arthromyalgia, which progressed to include an erythematous rash. He had a history of a tick bite 72 h earlier. The diagnosis of rickettsial infection was suspected and a course of doxycycline was initiated for a total of 5 days. His evolution was rapidly favorable under treatment, with resolution of the symptoms within 24 h. Blood cultures came back positive for Neisseria meningitidis serotype B, indicating an authentic purpura fulminans. Purpura fulminans is a medical emergency, a syndrome of intravascular thrombosis characterized by a very rapid evolution that requires early recognition and specific treatment. It is commonly described in the young and healthy patient and has high mortality and morbidity. Common bacteria mainly associated with purpura fulminans are Meningococcus spp., Pneumococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp."
15599155,The antimicrobial peptide BMAP-28 reduces lethality in mouse models of staphylococcal sepsis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: A mouse model of staphylococcal sepsis was used to compare the efficacy of the bovine antimicrobial peptide BMAP-28, a compound of the cathelicidin family, with that of conventional antibiotics. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: Research laboratory in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: BALB/c male mice. INTERVENTIONS: BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with 2.0 x 10(6) colony-forming units of live Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 or with 5.0 x 10(8) heat-killed cells of the same strain. All animals were randomized to receive intravenously isotonic sodium chloride solution, 2 mg/kg BMAP-28, 7 mg/kg imipenem, 7 mg/kg vancomycin, 7 mg/kg clindamycin, and 7 mg/kg clarithromycin immediately and at 6 hrs after bacterial challenge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lethality, quantitative blood cultures, and detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 plasma levels. In the experiments performed with live bacteria, all compounds reduced lethality rates and bacterial growth compared with controls. Imipenem and vancomycin exhibited the highest efficacy on these main outcome measures. In the experiments performed using heat-killed organisms, only BMAP-28 demonstrated significant efficacy on lethality rates, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 plasma levels compared with controls. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the capacity of BMAP-28 to reduce the effects of components of the bacterial cells and suggest that it may be beneficial in the treatment of severe staphylococcal infections in concert with other antimicrobial agents."

Thirty patients (67%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 4 (9%) died. Twelve (40%) received myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in first CR. Median OS and DFS are not reached (67% alive 12.5-31 months, 58% in CR 11.4-30 months), with median follow-up 22 months. Sixteen received FLAM in CR, with median OS and DFS 9 and 13.1 months, and 36% alive at 21-31 months. Short OS and DFS correlated with adverse cytogenetics, regardless of age or treatment in CR. The addition of allogeneic BMT in CR translates into long OS and DFS in the majority of eligible patients."
41460289,SIRT2 Regulates Ex Vivo PBMC Adhesion in Septic Shock Patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is deadly. Sepsis-immune response transitions from an endotoxin-sensitive, hyper-inflammatory phase to an endotoxin-tolerant hypo-inflammatory phase. In mice, we implicated sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) for prolonged hypo-inflammation using leukocyte adhesion, the earliest in vivo inflammatory response to cytokine, chemokine, and metabolite stimuli. The role of SIRT2 in human sepsis remains unknown. We hypothesized that: 1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) adhesion response can be used as a physiological biomarker of hypo-inflammation, and 2. SIRT2 regulates the functions of PBMCs and macrophages during the hypo-inflammatory phase of human sepsis. METHODS: We stimulated control and SS-whole blood and PBMCs +/- lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and investigated plasma cytokines, PBMC cell adhesion to ICAM-1 coated plates, adhesion molecule CD18 activation, SIRT2 expression, and cytokine response. In adhesion/endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and THP-1 cells treated +/- SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7, we analyzed cell adhesion, CD18 activation, and transmigration +/- LPS. In monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from SS vs. controls +/- AK-7, we analyzed phagocytosis. RESULTS: We found: 1. Muted plasma TNF and IL-1beta-response to LPS in SS vs. control (endotoxin-tolerance) 2. Endotoxin-tolerant SS-PBMCs exhibit high SIRT2 expression, and muted adhesion (adhesion-tolerance), CD18 activation, and transmigration with LPS. 3. SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 reverses endotoxin and adhesion-tolerance in SS-PBMCs via CD18 activation, reverses the defective transmigration of endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs and improves phagocytosis in MDMs from SS patients. CONCLUSION: PBMC adhesion, a physiological biomarker, can be used to detect hypo-inflammation. Defective PBMC and macrophage function in septic shock patients occur via high SIRT2 expression. SIRT2 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating sepsis-associated hypo-inflammation."
25658527,Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the rapid identification of yeasts causing bloodstream infections.,2015,"Few studies have systematically standardised and evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identification of yeasts from bloodstream infections. This is rapidly becoming pertinent for early identification of yeasts and appropriate antifungal therapy. We used 354 yeast strains identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing for standardisation and 367 blind clinical strains for validation of our MALDI-TOF MS protocols. We also evaluated different sample preparation methods and found the on-plate formic acid extraction method as most cost- and time-efficient. The MALDI-TOF assay correctly identified 98.9% of PCR-sequenced yeasts. Novel main spectrum projections (MSP) were developed for Candida auris, C. viswanathii and Kodamaea ohmeri, which were missing from the Bruker MALDI-TOF MS database. Spectral cut-offs computed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed 99.4% to 100% accuracy at a log score of >/= 1.70 for C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. pelliculosa, C. orthopsilosis, C. albicans, C. rugosa, C. guilliermondii, C. lipolytica, C. metapsilosis, C. nivariensis. The differences in the species-specific scores of our standardisation and blind validation strains were not statistically significant, implying the optimal performance of our test protocol. The MSPs of the three new species also were validated. We conclude that MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid, accurate and reliable tool for identification of bloodstream yeasts. With proper standardisation, validation and regular database expansion, its efficiency can be further enhanced."
25535825,"Clinical, microbiological, and genetic characteristics of heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a teaching hospital.",2015,"The emergence of vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) is of major concern worldwide. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence, phenotypic and molecular features of hVISA strains isolated from bacteremic patients and to determine the clinical significance of the hVISA phenotype in patients with bacteremia. A total of 104 S. aureus blood isolates were collected from a teaching hospital of Argentina between August 2009 and November 2010. No VISA isolate was recovered, and 3 out of 92 patients (3.3%) were infected with hVISA, 2 of them methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (4.5% of MRSA). Macro Etest and prediffusion method detected 3/3 and 2/3 hVISA respectively. Considering the type of bacteremia, the three cases were distributed as follows: two patients had suffered multiple episodes of bacteremia (both hVISA strains recovered in the second episode), while only one patient had suffered a single episode of bacteremia with hVISA infection. MRSA bloodstream isolates exhibiting the hVISA phenotype were related to HA-MRSA Cordobes clone (ST5-SCCmec I-spa t149) and MRSA Argentinean pediatric clone (ST100-SCCmec IVNV-spa t002), but not to CA-MRSA-ST30-SCCmec IV-spa t019 clone that was one of the most frequent in our country. Although still relatively infrequent in our hospital, hVISA strains were significantly associated with multiple episodes of bacteremia (p=0.037) and genetically unrelated."
25545023,Impact of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy on outcome of dogs with septic peritonitis.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy influenced survival in dogs with septic peritonitis. DESIGN: Retrospective case series (2003-2011). SETTING: University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Eighty-six dogs with cytological confirmation or positive bacterial culture of abdominal sepsis and subsequent surgical intervention. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine of 86 dogs (57%) survived to hospital discharge. Thirty-seven of 86 dogs were classified as having ''abdominal infection,'' 31/86 as ''severe sepsis,'' and the remaining 18/86 as in ''septic shock.'' Mortality was greatest in the ''septic shock'' category (94%). Empirical antimicrobial treatments were appropriate in 41/78 dogs (52.6%). Appropriateness was not associated with treatment outcome overall or when compared between sepsis severity groups. Antimicrobials had been given in the 30 days before admission in 63/86 (73.3%) dogs. Prior therapy with antimicrobials showed no association with outcome (P = 0.512) but was associated with subsequent inappropriate empirical antimicrobial selection (P = 0.031). Recent abdominal surgery was associated with subsequent inappropriate empirical antimicrobial selection (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: In this population, appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial choice was not associated with survival to discharge. Previous antimicrobial administration or abdominal surgery was associated with subsequent inappropriate empirical antimicrobial selection."
15787068,[Epidemiology of infection and sepsis in intensive care unit patients].,2004,"Since 1992, epidemiological and clinical studies have classified severe infections into three categories: sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Microbiological documentation is not always provided. We used a different approach, focusing on the infection itself, whether or not it is microbiologically documented or associated with sepsis. In an international prospective cohort study, all patients admitted to the participating units from May 1997 to May 1998 were followed until hospital discharge. Twenty-eight intensive care units (ICU) in eight countries enrolled 14,364 patients. Of these, 6011 stayed in the ICU for less than 24 hours and 8353 for more than 24 hours. Overall, 3034 infectious episodes were recorded at ICU admission (crude incidence rate 21.1%). Among patients hospitalized for more than 24 hours, 1581 infectious episodes occurred in the ICU (crude incidence rate 18.9%), including 713 cases (45%) in patients who were already infected at ICU admission. These rates varied among the ICUs. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract and primary bloodstream infections represented about 80% of all infections. Hospital-acquired and Intensive Care Unit-acquired infections were more frequently microbiologically documented than community-acquired infections (71% and 86%, respectively, vs 55%). About 28% of all infections were associated with sepsis, 24% with severe sepsis and 30% with septic shock (18% were not classified). Crude in-hospital mortality rates ranged from 16.9% in uninfected patients to 53.6% in patients who were both infected at the time of ICU admission and subsequently acquired an infection during the ICU stay. The in-hospital mortality rate increased with severity, from 20% for sepsis to 40% for severe sepsis and 60% for septic shock, but also depended on the origin of infection (community vs hospital/ICU). Crude incidence rates of ICU infection were high, varying among ICUs and patient subsets. Thus, vital outcome depends not only on the severity of sepsis but also on the characteristics of the infection."
25699372,The distribution and resistance of pathogens causing blood stream infections following liver transplantation: a clinical analysis of 69 patients.,2014,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the distribution and drug resistance of pathogens causing blood stream infections (BSIs) and provide the evidence for clinical therapy after liver transplantation. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples were processed by the BACTEC 9120 blood culture system. Species identification was performed using the Vitek-2 system. The drug susceptibility of pathogens was performed using the ATB FUNGUS 3 system. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty six episodes of BSIs occurred in 69 patients between January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2014. The gram-positive bacteria emerged as major pathogens and constituted 48.4% of all pathogens (61/126). The most common bacilli were Enterobacter spp and Enterococcus spp followed by S. aureus. The gram-negative bacteria were relatively sensitive to carbapenems and the gram-positive bacteria were relatively sensitive to glycopeptides and oxazolidone antibiotics. The drug resistance of fungi to amphotericin B, flucytosine, voriconazole and caspofungin was not found. CONCLUSION: In liver transplantation, gram-positive bacteria caused BSls more frequently than gram-negative bacteria. The resistance rate of bacteria to antibiotics was high while the rate was low in fungi."
41497501,Subphenotyping sepsis based on organ interaction trajectory using a deep temporal graph clustering model: a retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome with varying degrees of multi-organ dysfunction. Identifying dynamic inter-organ interactions is critical for accurate sepsis subphenotyping and targeted therapy, yet remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to quantify the dynamic trajectories of organ interactions to define sepsis phenotypes, supporting personalized treatment and clinical decision-making. METHODS: We proposed a novel deep temporal graph clustering model to identify sepsis phenotypes by quantifying dynamic multi-organ interactions within 48 h post-diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset (admissions from 2001 to 2012) and externally validated on the eICU Collaborative Research (eICU) dataset (admissions from 2014 to 2015). Its effectiveness was benchmarked against state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Patient characteristics, multi-organ system states coupling patterns, and prognostic outcomes were compared across the identified phenotypes. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used for early phenotype classification at 4 h post-diagnosis. To enhance clinical applicability, a user-friendly web interface was developed. Propensity score matching and weighted logistic regression were employed to evaluate the effects of the fluid management strategies on in-hospital mortality of patients with various phenotypes. FINDINGS: A total of 10,181 and 6208 unique sepsis patients were employed as the cohorts for the model development and external validation, respectively. Three distinct phenotypes were identified and labeled as Phenotype A, B, and C, exhibiting significant differences in baseline characteristics, organ system states coupling patterns, and outcomes (P-value < 0.05). Phenotype A had the lowest mortality (5.59%) and accounted for the largest proportion of patients (46.34%). In contrast, Phenotype C represented the highest mortality (38.27%) and comprised the smallest proportion (22.78%). Phenotype A was characterized by sustained synchronous improvement across organ system states. Phenotype B showed persistent decoupling of organ system states. Phenotype C exhibited a rapid transition from early asynchrony to synchronization. The model demonstrated robust clustering performance in external validation. The simplified classifier showed high predictive performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84 (95% CI [0.83, 0.86]) for phenotype prediction at 4 h post-diagnosis. The beneficial fluid management strategies varied across different phenotypes, highlighting the need for targeted fluid intervals. INTERPRETATION: This study characterizes sepsis phenotypes using organ interaction trajectories and identifies three heterogeneous patterns of disease progression. These patterns offer new insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sepsis, which can support the design of clinical trials on disease progression and guide the optimal allocation of intensive care resources. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 32371372) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFC2009503)."
25600893,Linezolid-resistant staphylococcal bacteraemia: A multicentre case-case-control study in Italy.,2015,"The aim of this multicentre study was to analyse the characteristics of patients with bloodstream infections due to staphylococcal strains resistant to linezolid. This was a retrospective case-case-control study of patients hospitalised in three large teaching hospitals in Italy. A linezolid-resistant (LIN-R) Staphylococcus spp. group and a linezolid-susceptible (LIN-S) Staphylococcus spp. group were compared with control patients to determine the clinical features and factors associated with isolation of LIN-R strains. All LIN-R Staphylococcus spp. strains underwent molecular typing. Compared with the LIN-S group, central venous catheters were the main source of infection in the LIN-R group. The LIN-R and LIN-S groups showed a similar incidence of severe sepsis or septic shock, and both showed a higher incidence of these compared with the control group. Overall, patients in the LIN-R group had a higher 30-day mortality rate. Multivariate analysis found previous linezolid therapy, linezolid therapy >14 days, antibiotic therapy in the previous 30 days, antibiotic therapy >14 days, previous use of at least two antibiotics and hospitalisation in the previous 90 days as independent risk factors associated with isolation of a LIN-R strain. The G2576T mutation in domain V of 23S rRNA was the principal mechanism of resistance; only one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis carried the cfr methylase gene (A2503), together with L4 insertion (71GGR72) and L3 substitution (H146Q). LIN-R strains are associated with severe impairment of clinical conditions and unfavourable patient outcomes. Reinforcement of infection control measures may have an important role in preventing these infections."
31826059,Acute Intermittent Porphyria - an Unexpected Association in a Patient with Newly Diagnosed Crohn's Disease.,2019,"The association of Crohn's disease (CD) with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), both without a family or personal pathological history, is a very rare clinical possibility. We present the case of a 23-year-old male diagnosed on the same admission with ileal CD and with an AIP crisis. The diagnosis was challenging as the symptoms overlapped. Crohn's disease was complicated with intestinal occlusion and sepsis; the inflammatory, metabolic and septic changes represented the trigger factor for the first AIP seizure. The neurological symptoms were the key element for AIP diagnosis. The presence of atypical extra-intestinal manifestations in CD patients should raise also the possibility of AIP."
41625328,"Baseline morbidity and chronic medications as determinants of sepsis outcomes: focus on statins, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs in a population-based cohort of 59,578 patients.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality, particularly among older adults with multiple chronic conditions. While comorbidities are known to influence outcomes, the role of chronic medication use before sepsis onset remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline health status and chronic treatments on sepsis-related mortality. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using linked administrative data from the Catalan Health System. Adults hospitalised with sepsis across 65 public hospitals in Catalonia during 2018-2019 were included. Baseline morbidity was assessed using the Adjusted Morbidity Groups (GMA) tool. Chronic medication use was defined as having received six or more prescription fills of a drug class in the 8 months prior to admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 59,578 sepsis patients (mean age 75.4 years), the in-hospital mortality rate was 18.5%. Most infections were community-acquired (88%) and associated with renal (58.3%) or cardiovascular (25.7%) dysfunction. The cohort had high comorbidity rates, with a GMA of 37.3, high level of dependency on health services; and high baseline health expenditure. Chronic use of statins, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), was observed in 28.5%, 5.6%, and 2.3% of patients respectively. Patients with high or very high GMA scores had the highest mortality rates. In multivariable analysis, chronic statin use was associated with lower odds of death (OR 0.782; 95% CI: 0.740-0.825), while corticosteroid (OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.085-1.306) and NSAID use (OR 1.415, 95% CI 1.226-1.632) were linked to increased mortality. Other risk factors included advanced age, active cancer, cirrhosis, and bloodstream infection. CONCLUSION: In this large population-based study, baseline comorbidities and chronic treatments significantly influenced sepsis outcomes. Statin use was associated with lower in-hospital mortality, whereas corticosteroids and NSAIDs were linked to worse prognosis. The GMA score proved useful in stratifying patient risk and may help to inform clinical decision-making and resource planning. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06354452."
41451099,Case Report: Maternal near-miss-recovery from refractory septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction secondary to acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections during pregnancy represent a significant clinical concern, posing considerable risks to both maternal and fetal health. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy increase the susceptibility to infections, with an estimated 15 to 20% of acute pyelonephritis cases potentially progressing to bacteremia, particularly in the context of urinary stones. The onset of sepsis may lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction, adversely affecting the kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, and central nervous system. Recent research into the pathogenesis of sepsis has provided insight into how inflammation and the activation of immune responses can induce abnormalities in circulatory function, subsequently triggering systemic ischemia and resulting hypoxia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old pregnant woman presented with acute renal colic and fever, leading to the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and acute pyelonephritis. The clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, evolving into uroseptic shock, cardiogenic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This alarming progression necessitated her admission to the intensive care unit, where she received aggressive treatment interventions, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Remarkably, these life-saving measures proved successful. After nine days in intensive care, she fully recovered and was discharged. CONCLUSION: This case study explores three critical clinical challenges: strategies for early identification of high-risk pregnant women for sepsis; optimal timing for interventions in obstructive urinary tract infections to prevent septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction; and the implementation of mechanical circulatory support. The circulatory support protocol highlights the importance of personalized interventions in complex medical scenarios."
19958338,"Extreme subcutaneous, intramuscular and inhaled insulin resistance treated by pancreas transplantation alone.",2010,"Diabetes mellitus with resistance to insulin administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly (DRIASM) is a rare syndrome and is usually treated with continuous intravenous insulin infusion. We present here two cases of DRIASM in 16 and 18 years female patients that were submitted to pancreas transplantation alone (PTA). Both were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as young children and had labile glycemic control with recurrent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis. They had prolonged periods of hospitalization and complications related to their central venous access. Exocrine and endocrine drainages were in the bladder and systemic, respectively. Both presented immediate graft function. In patient 1, enteric conversion was necessary due to reflux pancreatitis. Patient 2 developed mild postoperative hyperglycemia in spite of having normal pancreas allograft biopsy and that was attributed to her immunosuppressive regimen. Patient 1 died 9 months after PTA from septic shock related to pneumonia. In 8 months of follow-up, Patient 2 presented optimal glycemic control without the use of antidiabetic agents. In conclusion, PTA may be an alternative treatment for DRIASM patients."
41567194,Lysophosphatidic acid: a promising biomarker for diagnosing sepsis and predicting in-hospital mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has anti-inflammatory and protective effects in sepsis, yet clinical evidence on its correlation with sepsis progression and outcomes is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the association of plasma LPA levels with sepsis development, severity, and mortality. METHODS: A total of 42 sepsis patients and 29 controls with common infections were included. Among the sepsis patients, 15 succumbed during hospitalization. Plasma LPA levels were measured, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma LPA was significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to controls, and further reduced in non-survivors. Notably, correlation analyses suggested that LPA levels were negatively correlated with neutrophil count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Multivariate regression analysis identified LPA as an independent risk factor for sepsis onset and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that LPA had a high diagnostic accuracy for sepsis (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reduced plasma LPA levels in sepsis patients are inversely correlated with infection/inflammation markers and SOFA scores. Together, these results suggest that LPA may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for sepsis, supporting its potential as a complementary tool to enhance early risk stratification and guide bedside clinical decision-making."
31993410,Markers of NETosis Do Not Predict Neonatal Early Onset Sepsis: A Pilot Study.,2019,"Introduction: Early-onset sepsis in neonates potentially results in substantial morbidity and mortality. A key player in sepsis a neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to limit dissemination of pathogens. Aim of this study was to evaluate markers of NET formation in umbilical cord blood as a predictor of neonatal sepsis. Methods: Prospective study including term and preterm neonates. Umbilical cord blood samples were obtained immediately after birth and following markers of inflammation and NET formation were assessed: complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), levels of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), neutrophil elastase (NE), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The study population included neonates with confirmed early-onset sepsis and propensity score matched controls. Results: Umbilical cord blood samples of 491 neonates were obtained, of whom 17 neonates (n = 17) presented clinical and laboratory signs of infection within the first 72 h postpartum. Seventeen neonates without infection were matched as controls. IL-6 differed significantly between both groups, whereas other infection parameters such as CRP and neutrophil levels, and in particular the NET surrogate markers (cfDNA, NE, MPO), did not show any significant differences. Conclusion: NET markers in umbilical cord blood appear to not predict the onset of neonatal sepsis. These findings probably result from the neonates' inability or delayed ability to form NETs, which is suspected to be a main reason for the increased risk of severe infections in neonates, but is also assumed to prevent negative NET-mediated consequences during perinatal adaptation."
41497039,Implantable biosensors for continuous sepsis detection in postoperative care.,2026,"Implantable biosensors are emerging as transformative tools for real-time sepsis surveillance in postoperative patients. By continuously monitoring key inflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines and endotoxins, these systems can enable earlier diagnosis and intervention than traditional intermittent testing. Technological advances such as active-reset DNA-aptamer biosensors for cytokine tracking and electrochemical lipopolysaccharide sensors achieving attogram-level sensitivity illustrate rapid progress in the field. Research across the United States, Europe, and Asia highlights the growing global commitment to integrating biosensors into perioperative monitoring. Their application across surgical specialties may fundamentally shift postoperative care from reactive to predictive management, reducing sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Ongoing research into wireless communication, long-term biocompatibility, and multiplexed sensing will be pivotal to clinical translation and adoption in both high- and low-resource healthcare systems."
31820803,"The effect of group B streptococcus on maternal and infants' prognosis in Guizhou, China.",2019,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a kind of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and mainly strikes the lower digestive tract and genitourinary tract. It is a major risk factor for neonatal babies, seriously threatening their lives. In the present study, we aimed to detect the GBS colonization in late pregnant women, and to study the effect of GBS on maternal and infants' prognosis. Pregnant women with a gestational age of 35-37 weeks were enrolled in the study. Real-time polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the colonization of GBS in the vaginal and rectal secretions for late pregnant women according to the screening guidelines. Chi-square test was applied to analyze the relationship between GBS colonization and clinical characteristics. A follow-up of 6 weeks was performed on the puerpera and infants after delivery. The positive rate of GBS was 12.6% in late pregnant women. GBS carrier state was positively related to several pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine infection, premature rupture of membranes, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal distress and puerperal infection, as well as to part neonatal outcomes, containing neonatal infection, neonatal pneumonia and neonatal sepsis (all P < 0.05). GBS infection in late pregnant women results in adverse effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes."
32167269,Risk factors for 90-day reoperation and readmission after lumbar surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for 90-day readmission and reoperation after elective surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective consecutive cohort analysis of patients undergoing posterior lumbar decompression with or without fusion for LSS with claudication from January 2014 through December 2015. RESULTS: Data were collected on 1592 consecutive patients. The mean age at surgery was 67.4 +/- 10.1 years and 45% of patients were female. The 90-day reoperation rate was 4.7%, and 69.3% of the reoperations occurred within the first 30 days. The 90-day readmission rate was 7.2%. Multivariable analysis showed that postoperative development of a surgical site infection (SSI; odds ratio [OR] 14.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.86-25.18), acute kidney injury (AKI; OR 6.76, 95% CI 2.39-19.57), and urinary tract infection (UTI; OR 3.96, 95% CI 2.43-6.37), as well as a history of congestive heart failure (CHF; OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.69-5.28), were significant risk factors for readmission within 90 days. Male sex (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.92) was associated with decreased odds for readmission. With regards to reoperation, development of SSI (OR 25.06, 95% CI 13.54-46.51), sepsis (OR 7.63, 95% CI 1.52-40.59), UTI (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.31-4.76), and increased length of stay (LOS; OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) were found to be significant risk factors. A subsequent analysis found that morbid obesity (OR 6.99), history of coronary artery disease (OR 2.263), increased duration of surgery (OR 1.004), and LOS (OR 1.07) were significant risk factors for developing an SSI. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study found rates of 4.7% and 7.2% for reoperation and readmission, respectively, within 90 days: 30.7% of the reoperations and 44.7% of the readmissions occurred beyond the first 30 days. A diagnosis of SSI, AKI, UTI, and history of CHF were significant factors for readmission, while male sex was associated with decreased odds for readmission. A diagnosis of SSI, sepsis, UTI, and increased LOS were found to be significant predictors for reoperation. Understanding 90-day complication rates is imperative because there has been increased discussion and healthcare policy extending the global postoperative window to 90 days. Current literature supports a readmission rate of 3%-9% after spine surgery. However, this literature either is limited to a 30-day window or does not stratify between different types of spine surgeries.

20589146,Pattern and outcome of childhood intestinal obstruction at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal obstruction is a common cause of pediatric surgical emergency with a high morbidity and mortality in Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review of cases managed from January 1996 to December 2005 at a teaching hospital in Southwestern, Nigeria was done to examine the pattern of causes of intestinal obstruction in children and the management outcome. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty cases were seen over the study period with an age range of 2 hours to 14 years. Majority (61.24%) were infants, while 18.46% were neonates. Fifty-five cases (42.31%) were due to congenital causes while the rest were of acquired causes. The major causes of intestinal obstruction in the study were intussusception (29.23%), anorectal malformations (22.31%), obstructed inguinoscrotal hernia (16.92%) and Hirschsprung's disease (13.85%). Surgical site infection and sepsis were the commonest complications observed with an overall complication rate of 60.78%. The mortality rate was 3.08% and most (75%) occurred in neonates. CONCLUSION: While mortality as an outcome of management is low, the morbidity was very high in this study."
41412305,The first pediatric case successfully treated with cefiderocol for IMP-type carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales bacteremia.,2026,"Cefiderocol, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, exhibits potent activity against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). While its clinical efficacy has been reported for infections caused by KPC-type CPE and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, evidence regarding its effectiveness against IMP-type CPE remains primarily derived from in vitro studies, with limited clinical data available. This is the first pediatric case successfully treated with cefiderocol for IMP-type CPE bacteremia. He was a 6-year-old boy with inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency and acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. He developed bacteremia that blood culture multiplex PCR identified Klebsiella pneumoniae with IMP gene. The combination therapy of cefiderocol 60mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and gentamicin 5mg/kg/dose once daily sterilized blood culture, and subsequent monotherapy with cefiderocol was continued for a total of 14 days. Additional molecular test in the strain detected IMP-1 carbapenemase, SHV extended spectrum beta-lactamase and EBC-type AmpC beta-lactamase. Cefiderocol was susceptible at minimum inhibitory concentration 0.5mug/mL. Further study is needed for cefiderocol treatment for IMP-type CPE infection in children."
25524800,"Safety and activity of blinatumomab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study.",2015,"BACKGROUND: Adults with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have an unfavourable prognosis. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19, an antigen consistently expressed on B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. We aimed to confirm the activity and safety profile of blinatumomab for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study, we enrolled adult patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative, primary refractory or relapsed (first relapse within 12 months of first remission, relapse within 12 months after allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation [HSCT], or no response to or relapse after first salvage therapy or beyond) leukaemia. Patients received blinatumomab (9 mug/day for the first 7 days and 28 mug/day thereafter) by continuous intravenous infusion over 4 weeks every 6 weeks (up to five cycles), per protocol. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial haematological recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh) within the first two cycles. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466179. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, 189 patients were enrolled and treated with blinatumomab. After two cycles, 81 (43%, 95% CI 36-50) patients had achieved a CR or CRh: 63 (33%) patients had a CR and 18 (10%) patients had a CRh. 32 (40%) of patients who achieved CR/CRh underwent subsequent allogeneic HSCT. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile neutropenia (48 patients, 25%), neutropenia (30 patients, 16%), and anaemia (27 patients, 14%). Three (2%) patients had grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Neurologic events of worst grade 3 or 4 occurred in 20 (11%) and four (2%) patients, respectively. Three deaths (due to sepsis, Escherichia coli sepsis, and Candida infection) were thought to be treatment-related by the investigators. INTERPRETATION: Single-agent blinatumomab showed antileukaemia activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia characterised by negative prognostic factors. Further assessment of blinatumomab treatment earlier in the course of the disease and in combination with other treatment approaches is warranted. FUNDING: Amgen."
31833431,Clinical significance of follow-up blood culture in patients with a single Staphylococcus aureus-positive blood culture.,2020,"Background: We evaluated the frequency of a positive result in follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) and clinical outcome when FUBCs were not performed, in patients with a single Staphylococcus aureus-positive blood culture.Methods: We analyzed blood culture results in a prospective, observational cohort of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) at a tertiary-care hospital. All adult patients with only a single positive blood culture set from at least two blood culture sets drawn at the initial SAB episode were enrolled in the study. We analyzed FUBC results performed within 5 days after bacteraemia onset and compared the characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without FUBCs.Results: Of 305 patients with a single S. aureus-positive blood culture, FUBCs were obtained in 274 (90%) and were positive in 15% (42/274), of whom 50% were afebrile. The rate of positivity of FUBCs was significantly higher in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (19% versus 9%, p = .03). In 190 patients with a single MRSA-positive blood culture, the demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between patients with and without FUBCs (167 versus 23). Although mortality was comparable between the two groups, relapse of SAB was significantly more frequent in patients in whom FUBCs were not performed (17% versus 2%, p = .008).Conclusions: Even if a patient has a single S. aureus-positive blood culture and no fever, FUBCs should be performed to manage the infection properly and to prevent SAB relapse."
31905600,Transcriptional Suppression of the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Cytokine Release in Primary Macrophages by Low-Dose Anthracyclines.,2019,"Tissue-resident macrophages play critical roles in controlling homeostasis, tissue repair, and immunity. Inflammatory macrophages can sustain tissue damage and promote the development of fibrosis during infections and sterile tissue injury. The NLRP3 inflammasome and its effector cytokine IL-1beta have been identified as important mediators of fibrosis. Epirubicin, an anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit myeloid inflammatory cytokine production and to promote tissue tolerance following bacterial infection. We investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of epirubicin on the NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR4-mediated inflammation in PMA-primed THP-1 and in primary human peritoneal macrophages (PM). Low-dose epirubicin at non-cytotoxic doses downregulated NLRP3 inflammasome components and reduced the release of cleaved caspase-1, bioactive IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha following NLRP3 activation in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, epirubicin attenuated inflammatory macrophage responses after TLR4 and TLR2 ligation. These anti-inflammatory effects were not mediated by the induction of autophagy or altered MAPK signaling, but as the result of a global transcriptional suppression of LPS-dependent genes. Epirubicin-treated macrophages displayed reduced acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), suggesting anti-inflammatory epigenetic imprinting as one underlying mechanism."
26038004,Comparison of recombinant human thrombomodulin and gabexate mesylate for treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with sepsis following emergent gastrointestinal surgery: a retrospective study.,2015,"PURPOSE: Recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM) has been available in Japan since 2008, but there is concern about its association with postoperative hemorrhage. The efficacy and safety of rTM were examined in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by a septic condition after gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Forty-two patients were emergently admitted to the intensive care unit after emergent gastrointestinal surgery in Kyushu University Hospital from May 2008 to April 2013. Of these patients, 22 had DIC (defined as an acute DIC score >/= 4). All but three patients received treatment with gabexate mesylate (GM) (n = 9) or rTM (n = 10). The causes of sepsis were peritonitis with colorectal perforation, anastomotic leakage, and intestinal necrosis. Acute DIC score, sepsis-related organ failure assessment score, platelet count, and a variety of biochemical parameters were compared between rTM and GM recipients after treatment administration. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups for any parameter except C-reactive protein levels. The CRP level tended to be lower in the rTM group than in the GM group. Acute DIC score in the rTM group resolved significantly earlier than that in the GM group. No patient stopped the administration of rTM because of postoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION: rTM may be an effective therapeutic drug for the treatment of septic patients with DIC following emergent gastrointestinal surgery."
15657653,Total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy for fixed recurrent rectal cancer in the pelvis.,2004,"PURPOSE: This study evaluates the effectiveness of total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy for fixed recurrent tumor that developed from primary rectal cancer. METHODS: We investigated surgical indications, techniques to minimize blood loss and reduce complications, and oncological outcomes in 57 patients who underwent total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy between 1983 and 2001. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (84 percent) had negative margins. A comparison between two periods (1983-1992 and 1993-2001) showed that mean blood loss decreased from 4,229 to 2,500 ml (P = 0.002), indicating a favorable learning curve in minimizing blood loss. Two hospital deaths were observed in the earlier period and none in the later period. The most common sacral amputation level was the S3 superior margin, followed by the S4 inferior margin and the S2 inferior margin. The most frequent complication was sacral wound dehiscence in 51 percent, followed by pelvic sepsis in 39 percent. The incidence of pelvic sepsis in the later period was significantly decreased to 23 percent, compared with 72 percent in the earlier period (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis showed that negative margins and negative carcinoembryonic antigen predicted improved survival. In 48 patients with negative margins, three-year and five-year disease-specific survival rates were 62 percent and 42 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Strict patient selection makes total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy a feasible radical approach for fixed recurrent tumor. Careful performance of this surgical procedure along with the proper steps to decrease blood loss should achieve a favorable learning curve and low rate of surgical complications."
19954477,Hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B fiber column decreases clotting activity.,2009,"We investigated whether hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was able to improve coagulation abnormalities in patients with sepsis. Sixteen patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection and a mean arterial blood pressure > or =65mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilution catheter was inserted prior to DHP-PMX for intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twice within 24 h for 3 h each time. Circulating levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), the TAT/PIC ratio, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured six times. Before DHP-PMX, the TAT level was 24.5 +/- 8.3 ng/mL, the PIC level was 2.5 +/- 1.1 microg/mL, the TAT/PIC ratio was 13.9 +/- 3.5, and the PAI-1 level was 143.0 +/- 24.4 ng/L. The TAT level, TAT/PIC ratio, and PAI-1 were all significantly lower (P < 0.05) after 48 hr compared with before DHP-PMX, but no significant change of PIC was observed. In these patients with sepsis, fibrinolysis was inhibited by PAI-1, whereas clotting activity was significantly increased. This coagulation/fibrinolysis imbalance was improved by DHP-PMX. The present results suggest that indirect inhibition of clotting activity can be achieved in patients with sepsis through adsorption of lipopolysaccharide by DHP-PMX."
41413709,Prospective observational study of cell-free DNA as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis: COVSEP-study.,2025,"Hyperinflammation and extensive cell damage characterize both COVID-19-sepsis and bacterial sepsis, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), reflects ongoing tissue injury and may predict mortality. We aimed to evaluate cfDNA as a prognostic biomarker for 30-day mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19- vs. bacterial sepsis, and its association with inflammatory markers and disease progression. In a prospective observational study (ethics approval: 2020-15,535; DRKS-ID: DRKS00025222), cfDNA was quantified in 64 ICU patients (COVID-19-sepsis n = 27, bacterial sepsis n = 37) at four time points using quantitative PCR targeting 90 bp and 222 bp fragments of LINE-1 elements. An Integrity Index (222/90 bp) was calculated to infer the predominant mode of cell death. Nineteen healthy individuals served as controls. Associations with mortality and clinical parameters were analyzed using adjusted Cox regression, time-dependent models, and correlation analyses. Higher cfDNA levels (90 bp) within the first 24 h were strongly associated with 30-day (p = 0.003) and 180-day mortality (p = 0.003) in COVID-19-sepsis, but not in bacterial sepsis. COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher cfDNA levels (p < 0.01), which correlated with CRP, PCT, LDH, and lactate. The Integrity Index increased over time in bacterial sepsis and remained stable in COVID-19-sepsis, but was not predictive of survival. Elevated cfDNA levels were associated with ECMO therapy but not with renal replacement therapy. cfDNA is a valuable early prognostic biomarker in COVID-19-sepsis. Its rapid dynamics and strong correlation with clinical outcomes highlight its potential for real-time monitoring and risk stratification in viral sepsis."
15622592,Anterior sacral meningocele with presacral cysts: report of a case.,2004,"Anterior sacral meningocele is a rare anomaly most frequently presenting as a presacral mass. Since the first description in 1837, approximately 150 cases have been reported. The case presented is a 37-year-old female in whom an asymptomatic presacral mass was discovered during her first delivery. Because normal delivery was impossible, a cesarean section was performed. A year later, in a regional hospital a ""cystic presacral tumor"" was treated with biopsy and drainage. Four years later, she developed constipation caused by perineal compression for which she was admitted to our department in which two anterior presacral cysts were excised. The recovery was complicated with meningitis, which was successfully treated with antibiotics. Whenever a presacral mass is found, anterior sacral meningocele has to be a diagnostic consideration. The symptoms are usually related to the compression on rectum, bladder, and sacral nervous plexus. Rectal examination and radiography of the pelvis with the sacral bone showing the ""scimitar sign"" are the main diagnostic methods. Myelography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are the best methods for identifying the precise anatomy of sacral meningocele and for proper planning of the operation. Transvaginal or transrectal aspiration and drainage are not advised, because they may result in a lethal outcome caused by sepsis."
20030672,Immune response to Plasmodium vivax has a potential to reduce malaria severity.,2010,"Plasmodium falciparum infection causes transient immunosuppression during the parasitaemic stage. However, the immune response during simultaneous infections with both P. vivax and P. falciparum has been investigated rarely. In particular, it is not clear whether the host's immune response to malaria will be different when infected with a single or mixed malaria species. Phenotypes of T cells from mixed P. vivax-P. falciparum (PV-PF) infection were characterized by flow cytometry, and anti-malarial antibodies in the plasma were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found the percentage of CD3+delta2+-T cell receptor (TCR) T cells in the acute-mixed PV-PF infection and single P. vivax infection three times higher than in the single P. falciparum infection. This implied that P. vivax might lead to the host immune response to the production of effector T killer cells. During the parasitaemic stage, the mixed PV-PF infection had the highest number of plasma antibodies against both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Interestingly, plasma from the group of single P. vivax or P. falciparum malaria infections had both anti-P. vivax and anti-P. falciparum antibodies. In addition, antigenic cross-reactivity of P. vivax or P. falciparum resulting in antibodies against both malaria species was shown in the supernatant of lymphocyte cultures cross-stimulated with either antigen of P. vivax or P. falciparum. The role of delta2 +/- TCR T cells and the antibodies against both species during acute mixed malaria infection could have an impact on the immunity to malaria infection."
41474331,Effect of oral beta-lactam dosing on outcomes of bacteremic Gram-negative urinary tract infections: a real-world analysis.,2026,"Among 452 adult patients with Gram-negative bacteremia from a urinary tract infection source who received oral step-down therapy with highly bioavailable oral beta-lactam, we observed no difference in 60-day recurrence in patients treated with higher consensus-recommended dosing compared to lower, standard dosing (odds ratio = 0.76 [95% confidence interval = 0.43-1.32]), although the directionality of the effect was favorable. The study was limited by inadequate sample size and confounding. Randomized or large observational comparative effectiveness studies are needed.IMPORTANCEDefinitive treatment of Gram-negative bacteremia with oral antibiotic agents is not one size fits all. Use of oral fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is evidence-based but carries risk for adverse events. Data supporting the use of oral beta-lactams are mixed, likely in part due to variable agent selection and dosing. This analysis shows that higher, consensus-recommended dosing of highly bioavailable beta-lactam antibiotics was not significantly different from patients treated with lower dosing on 60-day recurrence. Our study was limited by the number of patients with discrete MICs and overinfluence of complicated urinary tract infection on outcomes."
31814574,Platelet parameters aid identification of adult-onset Still's disease from sepsis.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare, chronic, and systemic inflammatory disorder. The current study aims to evaluate the ability of platelets (PLTs), plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and PLT to PDW ratio (PPR) in a cohort of patients with AOSD or sepsis. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 82 AOSD patients, 48 sepsis patients, and 76 matched healthy controls. Platelet parameters were measured by Sysmex XE 2100 analysers. RESULTS: PPR and ferritin in AOSD patients were significantly higher than those in sepsis patients (22.18 +/-; 11.12 vs. 13.80 +/-; 8.97, p < 0.001; 3972.90 +/-; 5134.04 mug/l vs. 518.92 +/-; 382.50 mug/l, p = 0.001, respectively) and they were independent factors to differentiate AOSD from sepsis (OR: 5.86, 95%CI 1.59-21.60, p = 0.008; OR: 54.06, 95%CI 9.57-305.44, p < 0.001; respectively). Furthermore, PPR in AOSD and sepsis was significantly higher than that in matched controls. The area under the ROC curve of PPR, ferritin, and the combination were 0.733 (95%CI 0.646-0.820), 0.887 (95%CI 0.825-0.950), and 0.931 (95%CI 0.884-0.984), respectively. CONCLUSION: PPR can be used as a useful marker to differentiate AOSD from sepsis and the combined identification value of PPR and ferritin is much higher than that of any single factor."

25647886,Septic arthritis of the shoulder in a dental patient.,2014,"Septic arthritis of the glenohumoral joint is rare following dental procedures, comprising approximately 3% of all joint infections. Septic arthritis following bacteremia from dental procedures is uncommon and generally occurs in prosthetic joints. Predisposing causes may include immunocompromising diseases such as diabetes, HIV infection, renal failure and intravenous drug abuse. We report a rare case of unilateral glenohumoral joint septic arthritis in a 60-year-old male patient (without a prosthetic joint) secondary to a dental procedure. The insidious nature of the presentation is highlighted. Septic arthritis infections, though rare, require a high level of clinical suspicion. Vague symptoms of shoulder pain may mask the initial diagnosis, as was the case in our patient. Incision and drainage via surgical intervention are often required, followed by parenteral antibiotics."
25525814,An 8-month history of meningitis in an extremely low birth weight infant? - Long-lasting Infection with Ureaplasma parvum.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: Ureaplasma spp. have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both preterm labor and neonatal morbidity including pneumonia and sepsis and the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Data on Ureaplasma meningitis are limited and partly controversially discussed. PATIENT: We report the unique case of a 9-month-old infant with progressive internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and developmental delay due to a history of>200 days of inflammation of the central nervous system. The female extremely low birth weight infant had been referred to our hospital for ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. She had been born at 26+3 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 940 g. With the exception of a moderate respiratory distress syndrome, postnatal period had been reported uneventful. However, internal hydrocephalus had become manifest at 4 weeks of postnatal age. Intraventricular hemorrhage had not been documented by cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had repetitively revealed pronounced inflammation reflected by pleocytosis (50-86 leukocytes/muL, 60% lymphocytes), CSF protein levels of 578-1,026 mg/dL and undetectable CSF glucose. Although suggesting bacterial meningitis, microbial diagnostics had not been indicative, and empirical antibiotics had not affected the CSF findings. On admission to our hospital, CSF analysis still documented significant inflammation (125 leukocytes/muL, CSF protein 565 mg/dL, CSF glucose<2 mg/dL). RESULTS: Due to a prenatal history of cerclage, we initiated microbial diagnostics on Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. U. parvum was detected in CSF by culture and PCR, no other pathogens were isolated. On intravenous treatment with chloramphenicol, CSF profile continuously normalized, and cultures and PCR became negative. Treatment was continued for 3 weeks, and the infant was discharged after uncomplicated ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. During a 12-month observation period she has shown encouraging recovery. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, in particular, internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and sustained CSF inflammation are highly suggestive of Ureaplasma meningitis. Our case highlights that infection may escape detection if not explicitly considered, since microbial diagnosis requires complex media and PCR."
16704141,Outcomes of kidney transplants from non-heart-beating deceased donors as reported to the Japan Organ Transplant Network from April 1995-December 2003: a multi-center report.,2004,"Between April 1995-December 2003, 1,324 deceased donor kidney transplantations were performed in 139 transplant institutes in Japan. Of these, 45 transplants were from heart-beating and 1,279 transplants were from non-heart-beating deceased donors (NHBDD). Clinical outcomes for the 1,279 recipients of NHBDD kidney transplants were investigated. The overall 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 90% and 72%, respectively. A total of 112 NHBDD kidney grafts never functioned after transplantation and the recipients had to remain on dialysis. The causes of nonfunction were rejection, primary nonfunction, death, thrombosis and others in the order of the incidence. The major causes of graft loss were nonfunction, death, chronic rejection and acute rejection in that order. Major causes of recipient deaths were pneumonia, sepsis and CVA within 12 months, and heart diseases, sepsis, malignancy and pneumonia more than 12 months after transplantation. Kidneys from female donors, donors aged 15 or less or over age 60, donors with extrinsic causes of death other than head trauma, recipients over age 60 and those with diabetic nephropathy as their original disease were found to be at risk for poor graft survival. The lowest and last donor serum creatinine level did not influence the incidence of nonfunction or graft survival. However, graft survival was significantly poorer among recipients of older ""expanded"" donor kidneys than for recipients of younger grafts. The warm and total ischemia times should be kept shorter than 30 minutes (better 15 minutes), and 12 hours, respectively to minimize the incidence of nonfunction and early graft loss. It is especially important in cases with WIT over 30 minutes that the total ischemia should be kept within 12 hours. Cannulation before cardiac standstill was important to reduce the incidence of nonfunction and achieve high graft survival rates with NHBDD kidneys. The discontinuance of ventilator support also reduced the incidence of graft nonfunction. The combination of CsA or Tacrolimus and MMF as both the induction and maintenance regimen significantly improved graft survival. The use of either anti-T cell antibodies or basiliximab was also associated with significantly better graft survival for NHBDD kidneys. The combination of basiliximab, CsA and MMF resulted in a graft survival rate of 98% at one and 2 years."
26016287,[Hip fracture as risk factor for mortality in patients over 65 years of age. Case-control study].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture among older patients is a devastating injury in most cases. It profoundly affects the physical, mental, functional and social balance that patients used to have and, beyond the orthopedic injury, it reflects the aging process and its dire consequences. Some reports show that up to 50% of patients with hip fracture die within six months and many of those who survive do not recover their baseline independence and function. In recent decades the increase in life expectancy after 60 years of age has led to an exponential growth in hip fractures. This is why it is essential to determine the patient-related and environmental factors leading to the increased mortality rates seen in patients with hip fracture, to improve the survival and quality of life of older adults. The objective was to determine the association between hip fracture and mortality in patients over 65 years of age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, longitudinal, retrospective, descriptive, comparative case-control study was conducted. The clinical records of all patients over 65 years of age admitted to the Orthopedics Service, Hospital Regional <<Lic. Adolfo Lopez Mateos>>, ISSSTE, with a diagnosis of hip fracture during the previous 12 months were analyzed, regardless of the type of fracture and treatment they received. A group of patients without hip fracture was used as control group. Total sample size was 50 patients with hip fracture and 50 patients without hip fracture. The following data were collected in data collection forms: age, sex, time elapsed since the fracture, survival at one year and, in the case of deceased patients, the cause of death (pneumonia, sepsis, arrhythmia, hydroelectrolytic imbalance, heart failure and others). The results obtained are shown as tables and charts to facilitate their visual understanding. RESULTS: Patient demographics show that there were 40 (80%) female patients and 10 (20%) male patients with a diagnosis of hip fracture. The control group included 35 (70%) females and 15 (30) males. An association between hip fracture and increased mortality was found, with a significant p value of 0.001. The main cause of death among hip fracture patients in our study was sepsis in 7 (35%), while among the control group it was myocardial infarction in 3 (15%). Time wise, mortality was found to be higher within the first six months, with 10 deaths (50%), and within the first year, with six deaths (30%). DISCUSSION: Hip fracture is in fact a risk factor associated with mortality among patients over 65 years of age. Females are the group most prone to sustaining a hip fracture and, therefore, to increased mortality rates. The major cause of death among our patient population was sepsis, apparently caused by mismanagement of soft tissues, a poor aseptic technique during the surgical procedure, a long hospital stay or a poor family support network, and dementia, which is related to poor surgical wound care. The highest mortality rates were found in ages over 90 years, and they were associated with preexisting chronic-degenerative conditions. The age group at highest risk of hip fracture was 80-89 years. Patients with hip fracture should always be managed together with the internist and the geriatrician and they should be considered as orthopedic emergencies, as a long hospital stay and delayed surgical treatment are associated with major complications and increased mortality rates."
41426991,Study on the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in neurocritical care patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common neurological complication in neurocritical care units, characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction without direct central nervous system infection. Early identification and prognosis assessment remain challenging due to the lack of specific diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of early microcirculation perfusion indicators combined with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring for the occurrence and prognosis of SAE in neurocritical care patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 200 neurocritical care patients with sepsis over a 2-year period. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed using sidestream dark field (SDF) videomicroscopy, measuring perfused vessel density (PVD), microvascular flow index (MFI), and perfused boundary region (PBR). Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring was performed for 72 h. Serum biomarkers including neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were measured at admission and serially. The primary outcome was the development of SAE, and secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and neurological function at 90 days. RESULTS: Among 200 patients, 134 (67%) developed SAE. Patients with SAE showed significantly reduced PVD (8.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 12.4 +/- 2.8 mm/mm(2), p < 0.001) and MFI (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001) compared to non-SAE patients. The combination of microcirculation parameters with EEG abnormalities yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) for predicting SAE. Early microcirculation-EEG patterns were strongly associated with 28-day mortality (HR: 3.45, 95% CI: 2.12-5.61, p < 0.001) and poor neurological outcomes at 90 days. CONCLUSION: The combination of early microcirculation perfusion indicators with neuroelectrophysiological monitoring provides excellent predictive value for SAE occurrence and prognosis in neurocritical care patients. This multimodal approach may facilitate early identification and risk stratification."

Decision of the surgical cyst removal at the right moment and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are key factors for a positive outcome."
31843822,Diagnostic accuracy of presepsin in predicting bacteraemia in elderly patients admitted to the emergency department: prospective study in Japan.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: Early prediction of bacteraemia in the elederly is needed in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective study in Japan; single-centre trial in patients who satisfied the sepsis criteria was conducted between September 2014 and March 2016. Forty-six elderly patients aged >/=70 years were included. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Osaka Medical College. Ethics Committee approval number was 1585. INTERVENTIONS: Blood sampling to evaluate C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin plasma levels; two sets of blood sampling for bacterial cultures; and evaluations of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores were performed on arrival at the ED. The results were compared between patients with bacteraemia and those without bacteraemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The accuracy of detecting bacteraemia. RESULTS: The presepsin value was significantly higher in the bacteraemia group than in the non-bacteraemia group (866.6+/-184.6 vs 639.9+/-137.1 pg/mL, p=0.03). The PCT and CRP did not significantly differ between the groups. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values were not significantly different among presepsin (0.69), PCT (0.61) and CRP (0.53). Multivariate analysis showed that presepsin was independently associated with bacteraemia (OR 8.84; 95% CI 0.95 to 81.79; p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Presepsin could be a good biomarker to predict bacteraemia in elderly patients with sepsis criteria admitted to the ED."
31823149,"Evidence supporting recommendations from international guidelines on treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of HAP and VAP in adults.",2020,"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are intended to support clinical decisions and should be based on high-quality evidence. The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations issued in CPGs for therapy, diagnosis, and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). CPGs released by international scientific societies after year 2000, using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, were analyzed. Number and strength of recommendations and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) were extracted and indexed in the aforementioned sections. High-quality evidence was based on randomized control trials (RCT) without important limitations and exceptionally on rigorous observational studies. Eighty recommendations were assessed, with 7 (8.7%), 24 (30.0%), 29 (36.3%), and 20 (25.0%) being supported by high, moderate, low, and very low-quality evidence, respectively. Highest evidence degree was reported for 26 prevention recommendations, with 7 (26.9%) supported by high-quality evidence and no recommendation based on very low-quality evidence. In contrast, among 9 recommendations for diagnosis and 45 for therapy, none was supported by high-quality evidence, in spite of being recommended as strong in 33.3% and 46.7%, respectively. Among HAP/VAP diagnosis recommendations, the majority of evidence was rated as low or very low-quality (55.6% and 22.2%, respectively) whereas among HAP/VAP therapy recommendations, 4/5 were rated as low and very low-quality (40% each). In conclusion, among HAP/VAP international guidelines, most recommendations, particularly in therapy, remain supported by observational studies, case reports, and expert opinion. Well-designed RCTs are urgently needed."
41431014,Impact of emergency department-to-intensive care unit transfer time on in-hospital mortality: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"We evaluated whether emergency department (ED)-to-intensive care unit (ICU) transfer time is associated with in-hospital mortality among adults admitted with ICU-level indications, using a prespecified 4-hour quality threshold. In this retrospective cohort from a tertiary academic hospital (January-December 2023), we analyzed 376 adults admitted to the ICU from the ED. Demographics, comorbidities, primary diagnoses, laboratory markers, and ED process metrics were extracted. ED length of stay (ED-LOS) was examined continuously and categorically (</=4 vs >4 hours). Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality. Overall in-hospital mortality was 54.3%. Median ED-LOS was 194 minutes in survivors versus 220 minutes in non-survivors. While continuous ED-LOS was not significantly different between groups, ED-LOS > 4 hours was independently associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.82; P = .01). Additional predictors included advanced age, sepsis diagnosis, low serum albumin, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II >/= 35; presentation during daytime hours was associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.97; P = .04). ED-to-ICU transfer delays > 4 hours are independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. While timely ICU admission is critical, optimizing care during ED boarding may mitigate risk. These findings support system-level interventions targeting ICU transfer within 4 hours for critically ill patients."
15618075,Early and late outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection: analysis of risk factors in 487 consecutive patients.,2005,"AIMS: The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the risk factors for the early and late outcome of the surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection, in terms of mortality and morbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1976 to 2003, 487 patients with acute type A aortic dissection treated surgically were enrolled. Twenty-five pre-operative and intra-operative variables were analysed to identify conditions influencing early and late morbidity and early mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate including operative death was 22% (107 patients). Multivariable analysis indicated that pre-existing cardiac disease (RR=3.7, 95% CI=1.8-7.4) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RR=6.8, 95% CI=2.3-20.2) were independent predictors of in-hospital death. The causes of in-hospital mortality were low cardiac output in 32 patients (6.6%), major brain damage in 24 patients (5.9%), haemorrhage in 11 patients (2.2%), sepsis in nine patients (1.8%), visceral ischaemia in eight patients (1.6%), multiple organ failure in seven patients (1.4%), rupture of the thoracic aorta in six patients (1.2%), respiratory failure in six patients (1.2%), and four intra-operative deaths. The follow-up was 100% complete. The actuarial survival was 94.9+/-1.2% and 88.1+/-2.6%, at 5 and 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' pre-operative co-morbidities and dissection-related complications significantly affect early and late survival and morbidity after surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection."
15626312,[Tachypnoea and dyspnoea in two infants due to dilated cardiomyopathy associated with an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery].,2004,"Two infants were referred to the emergency ward: a 3.5-month-old male infant in whom sweating and shortness of breath were seen during drinking and crying, and a 5-week-old girl that had drunk less the past day, moaned while breathing for the past few hours and had become increasingly drowsy. They were not suffering from an infection but from a dilated cardiomyopathy based on an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. The left coronary artery was then implanted in the aorta surgically. Both patients recovered well. Airway tract infection and sepsis are obvious common differential diagnostic considerations when confronted with a tachy-dyspnoeic infant. However, a cardiac cause, such as a dilated cardiomyopathy with cardiac decompensation, must also be considered as the presentation can be similar. The abnormal origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the few readily well treatable causes."
31823147,Diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a retrospective observational study.,2020,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the clinical impact of isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP; eazyplex(R) MRSA kits) for rapid diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) in comparison with conventional blood culture diagnostics. We performed a retrospective, single-center observational study over the period between November 2016 and December 2018 on patients (and blood cultures) with growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters in their blood cultures. We quantified diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity and specificity for detection of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and the mecA/C resistance genes in 797 blood cultures. The clinical impact was assessed by time to result reporting, time to appropriate treatment, and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) in 190 SAB patients. We observed sensitivity and specificity above 90% for S. aureus detection (sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)), 99.57% (97.61%, 99.98%); specificity, 99.12% (97.95%, 99.71%)), for MRSA detection (sensitivity, 100% (89.11%, 100.00%); specificity, 99.72% (99.05, 99.96)), and for mecA/C detection (sensitivity, 94.71% (91.85%, 96.78%); specificity, 95.89% (93.58%, 97.54%)). LAMP testing was associated with shorter median time to result reporting (24.0 h (first and third quartiles (Q1-Q3), 20.0-27.0 h) vs 41.5 h (36.0-46.0 h); p < 0.001) and different distribution of time to appropriate treatment (2.0 days (1.0-3.0) vs 2.0 days (2.0-3.0); p = 0.004). No evidence for differences in length-of-stay in ICU was observed. Our analysis suggests for the application of LAMP (i) a high diagnostic accuracy for detection of S. aureus and the mecA/C genes in blood cultures, (ii) an earlier result reporting, and (iii) a shorter time to appropriate treatment."
32069257,Epidemiology and mortality in bacterial bloodstream infections in patients with hematologic malignancies.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with hematological malignancies, who are in the high risk group for infectious complications and bacterial bloodstream infections. The aim of the study evaluated epidemiology and mortality in bacterial bloodstream infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. In addition to determine the risk factors, changes in the distribution and frequency of isolated bacterias. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective study. There were investigated data from 266 patients with hematological malignancies and bacterial bloodstream infections who were hospitalized between the dates 01/01/2012 and 12/31/2017. RESULTS: There were 305 blood and catheter cultures in febrile neutropenia attacks in total. In these total attacks, primary bloodstream infections were 166 and catheter-related bloodstream infections were 139. In blood cultures; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria were detected in 58,0% and 22,9% of the samples, respectively. 52,4% of the cultured Gram-negative bacterias were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Carbapenemase positive culture rate was 17,2% in Gram-negative bacteria cultures. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found in 38,4% of the Gram-positive bacteria cultures. In Gram-positive bacteria; methicillin resistance were detected in 82,2% of the samples. There was a statistically significant relationship between bloodstream infection and disease status. 60 patients with primary bloodstream infections were newly diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematological malignancies, certain factors in the bloodstream infections increase the mortality rate. With the correction of these factors, the mortality rate in these patients can be reduced. The classification of such risk factors may be an important strategy to improve clinical decision making in high-risk patients, such as patients with hematological malignancies."
41624233,Platelet lipidome alterations in septic shock: a matched case-control study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Platelets play a central role in hemostatic and inflammatory responses during septic shock, with lipids being essential for their function. However, the specific lipidomic alterations occurring in platelets during septic shock remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize platelet lipidomic changes in septic shock and investigate their associations with disease severity. METHODS: In this matched case-control study, platelets were isolated from 49 septic shock patients and 47 nonseptic controls (matched for age, gender, and comorbidities). Lipidomic profiling was performed using untargeted lipidomics to identify significant alterations in the platelet lipidome. Associations among lipid changes, clinical data, and plasma biomarkers of coagulopathy and inflammation were explored. RESULTS: More than 60% of the annotated platelet lipids were significantly altered in septic shock. Cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and ether-lipids were significantly reduced, while ceramide levels increased. Fatty acyl chain remodeling displayed distinct patterns, with polyunsaturated fatty acids increasing in triacylglycerols and decreasing in phospholipids. Lipid alterations were strongly associated with thrombocytopenia, and lysophosphatidylcholine levels inversely correlated with disease severity, as indicated by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock induces significant disruptions in the platelet lipidome, with the extent of these alterations correlating with sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia severity. The observed changes affect multiple lipid classes, surpassing those reported under physiological conditions or in other diseases. These findings highlight the impact of sepsis-driven dysregulated inflammation and coagulopathy on platelet lipid composition, providing new insights into sepsis pathophysiology."
19949414,Metabolic endotoxemia and saturated fat contribute to circulating NGAL concentrations in subjects with insulin resistance.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Lipocalin-2 (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL) is an innate immune system protein that has been linked to insulin resistance and obesity, but the mechanisms behind these associations are poorly known. We hypothesized that endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and fat intake were in the background of these associations. DESIGN: We studied four cohorts: (1) a cross-sectional study in 194 subjects; (2) the changes in NGAL concentration induced by diet and weight loss in 36 obese women (with circadian rhythm in 8 of them); (3) the effects of acute fat intake on circulating NGAL concentration in 42 morbidly obese subjects; and (4) LPS-induced NGAL secretion ex vivo (whole blood and adipose tissue explants). RESULTS: Serum NGAL concentration was significantly associated with fasting triglycerides and LPS-binding protein in patients with type 2 diabetes. In obese subjects, the intake of saturated fatty acids was the factor that best explained the variance of NGAL changes after weight loss (contributing independently to 14% of NGAL variance). In fact, weight loss significantly changed the circadian rhythm of NGAL. The acute increase in circulating NGAL after fat overload was significantly associated with fasting insulin (r=0.52, P<0.001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r=0.36, P=0.02) and post-load triglyceride concentrations (r=0.38, P=0.018). LPS-induced NGAL secretion from adipose tissue explants did not change significantly, but LPS led to a significant increase in NGAL concentration in the whole blood obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Metabolic endotoxemia and saturated fat might contribute to circulating NGAL concentration in patients with insulin resistance."
41536855,Evaluating the effect of probiotics on severe necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation in England and Wales: a propensity-matched population study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. This study aimed to examine whether probiotics reduce the risk of severe NEC and other key neonatal morbidities including late onset sepsis and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study using the United Kingdom National Neonatal Research Database. Infants <32 weeks gestation in England and Wales (01/01/2016-31/12/2022) were included if alive on day four, without major congenital anomaly. A propensity score matched approach was applied matching for gestational age cohorts, birth year epochs and 17 further items. Comparators were infants who were exposed or not to probiotics within 14 days. Primary outcome was severe NEC (confirmed at laparotomy or postmortem or listed primary cause of death). Parent focus groups and former NICU patients supported this study but did not contribute to design or writing. FINDINGS: 48,048 infants (45.2% (21,695/48,048) female), median gestational age 29.4 weeks (IQR 27.4-30.9) were included; 25.3% (12,161/48,048) were exposed to at least one of five available probiotics. 3.6% (1728/48,048) had severe NEC. Of 16,586 infants (8293 exposed and 8293 unexposed) in the propensity-matched analysis, incidence and odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) for exposed versus unexposed for severe NEC was 3.3% versus 4.2%, OR 0.80 (0.72-0.89); other definitions of NEC yielded similar results. Incidence for late onset sepsis (10.8% versus 11.5%, OR 0.94 (0.90-0.97)) and survival to discharge (96.6% versus 94.2%, OR 1.76 (1.65-1.88)). In infants <28 weeks gestation, severe NEC (8.7% versus 9.8%, OR 0.88 (0.82-0.93) and for >/=28 weeks (1.0% versus 1.7%, OR 0.59 (0.47-0.73). INTERPRETATION: Probiotics were associated with a reduction in severe NEC including in those <28 weeks gestation. We currently recommend neonatal units not already using probiotics, to consider the introduction of products meeting appropriate recommendations, in the context of their local morbidity rates.

17021468,Amniotic fluid embolus: can we affect the outcome?,2003,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare catastrophe unique to pregnancy. Its mortality rate remains high despite efforts at prompt and aggressive management protocols, highlighting the need to maintain a high index of suspicion. RECENT FINDINGS: The intrusion of amniotic fluid into the maternal bloodstream may lead in certain women to a complex series of physiological reactions mimicking those seen in human anaphylaxis or sepsis, negating the purely embolic phenomenon theory as previously understood. The clinical picture is the sudden onset of cardiovascular collapse, cyanosis, haemorrhage or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, during or soon after delivery. SUMMARY: The mainstay of a successful outcome remains the identification of high-risk patients, as well as early clinical diagnosis and management."
41551844,Prediction of hospital mortality in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury using a machine-learning approach: a multicenter study using SHAP interpretability analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) represents a critical complication with high mortality rates in intensive care units. Current risk stratification tools lack precision and interpretability for clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate interpretable machine learning models for predicting hospital mortality in S-AKI patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized five international critical care databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV (n = 12 966), MIMIC-III-CareVue (n = 2209), eICU (n = 8210), Northwestern University Intensive Care Unit (NWICU) (n = 2207) and Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb) (n = 1893). Adult patients with S-AKI meeting sepsis-3.0 and acute kidney injury criteria were included. Feature selection used the Boruta algorithm on MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-III and eICU databases. Eleven machine learning algorithms were trained using MIMIC-IV data with external validation on all other datasets. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided model interpretability. RESULTS: Among 27 485 S-AKI patients, hospital mortality was 27.5%. Boruta identified 21 consensus features including severity scores [Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OASIS], vital signs and laboratory parameters. Gradient Boosting Machine emerged as optimal with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.770 (training), 0.731 (internal validation) and 0.732-0.778 across four external validation cohorts. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and minimal overfitting (3.9% AUC difference). Decision curve analysis revealed superior clinical utility across probability thresholds of 4%-82%. SHAP analysis identified SAPS II as the most important predictor, with scores >60 and SOFA >15 associated with substantially increased mortality risk. Complete case analysis confirmed model robustness (AUC 0.766-0.847). CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning model demonstrated excellent performance and robust generalizability for S-AKI mortality prediction across five international databases. SHAP analysis provided clinically meaningful insights supporting personalized risk stratification and evidence-based clinical decision-making."

INTRODUCTION: Some patients with abdominal sepsis will require open abdomen management to avoid abdomen compartment syndrome. We compare use of the Bogota bag with a technique developed at our Institution with a subcutaneous polyethylene bag. METHODS: Thirty nine consecutive patients with abdominal sepsis who were managed with open abdomen. RESULTS: Twenty one patients with Bogota bag and 18 patients with subcutaneous polyethylene bag. Patients with Bogota bag had more report surgery intrabdominal complications compared with patients with subcutaneous polyethylene bag (p = 0.04, p = 0.037, respectively). Mortality was the same. CONCLUSIONS: Use of subcutaneous polyethylene bag in patient with abdominal sepsis and open abdomen appears safer when compared with Bogota bag."

20002062,"A synthetic analogue of 20-HETE, 5,14-HEDGE, reverses endotoxin-induced hypotension via increased 20-HETE levels associated with decreased iNOS protein expression and vasodilator prostanoid production in rats.",2010,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is responsible for endotoxin (ET)-induced hypotension and vascular hyporeactivity and plays a major contributory role in the multiorgan failure. Endotoxic shock is also associated with an increase in vasodilator prostanoids as well as a decrease in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and cytochrome P450 4A protein expression, and production of a vasoconstrictor arachidonic acid product, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a synthetic analogue of 20-HETE, N-[20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoyl]glycine (5,14-HEDGE), on the ET-induced changes in eNOS, iNOS and heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) expression as well as 20-HETE and vasodilator prostanoid (6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2)) production. ET-induced fall in blood pressure and rise in heart rate were associated with an increase in iNOS protein expression and a decrease in eNOS protein expression in heart, thoracic aorta, kidney and superior mesenteric artery. ET did not change hsp90 protein expression in the tissues. ET-induced changes in eNOS and iNOS protein expression were associated with increased 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2) levels and a decrease in 20-HETE levels, in the serum and kidney. These effects of ET on the iNOS protein expression and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), PGE(2) and 20-HETE levels were prevented by 5,14-HEDGE. Furthermore, a competitive antagonist of vasoconstrictor effects of 20-HETE, 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z),15(Z)-dienoic acid, prevented the effects of 5,14-HEDGE on the ET-induced changes in systemic and renal levels of these prostanoids and 20-HETE. These data are consistent with the view that an increase in systemic and renal 20-HETE levels associated with a decrease in iNOS protein expression and vasodilator prostanoid production contributes to the effect of 5,14-HEDGE to prevent the hypotension during rat endotoxemia."
26064034,"Congenital malaria in a neonate: case report with a comprehensive review on differential diagnosis, treatment and prevention in Indian perspective.",2015,"Although malaria in pregnancy, lactation and congenital malaria can be a disease burden in the endemic zones of Africa and Indian sub-continent, it is still epidemiologically less investigated in India. As it may lead to considerable maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, awareness and timely intervention is necessary for desirable outcome and prevention of the condition. Very few reports of congenital malaria are available in the literature from an endemic country like India. Herein we describe a case of congenital malaria from north India in a 21-day neonate. Clinical presentation of this condition in the neonate may offer a considerable diagnostic challenge, and differentiation from vector borne malaria in infants may be important from the management point of view. Hence a review of the differential diagnosis, management and prevention of congenital malaria has been attempted in the Indian perspective."
41475068,"IL-8-, IL-12-, and VEGF-producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells enable differentiation between vertebral osteomyelitis and degenerative spinal diseases.",2026,"Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is a rare but serious spinal infection that presents significant challenges in early diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic delays can result in severe complications, including neurological deficits, sepsis, organ failure, and death. In this study, we investigated the immune cell source of candidate cytokines - IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and VEGF - with the aim of distinguishing VO from degenerative spinal diseases. Peripheral blood samples were collected pre-operatively and 40 to 56 days post-operatively. Cytokine production by major immune cell subsets within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed using intracellular flow cytometry. Our findings indicate that pre-operative differentiation between VO and degenerative spinal diseases is feasible, particularly based on IL-8-positive CD8(+) T-cells, IL-12-positive CD45(+) lymphocytes, and VEGF-positive cells (including CD45(+) cells, B-cells, T-cells, and CD8(+) T-cells)."
25596977,"Nationwide survey of the development of drug resistance in the pediatric field in 2000-2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2012: evaluation of the changes in drug sensitivity of Haemophilus influenzae and patients' background factors.",2015,"The Drug-Resistant Pathogen Surveillance Group in Pediatric Infectious Disease has conducted surveillance of pediatric patients with respiratory tract infections, meningitis, and sepsis five times (in 2000-2001 [period 1], 2004 [period 2], 2007 [period 3], 2010 [period 4], and 2012 [period 5]). With respect to the clinically isolated Haemophilus influenzae, the drug susceptibility, the frequency of drug-resistant strains, and patients' background factors in each period have already been reported. Here we evaluate trends in the development of drug resistance in H. influenzae, and the relationship between the development of drug resistance and patients' background factors in the aforementioned five periods. H. influenzae derived from pediatric patients with respiratory tract infections that had been previously collected (period 1, 448 isolates; period 2, 376 isolates; period 3, 386 isolates; period 4, 484 isolates; and period 5, 411 isolates) were analyzed. The proportions of ss-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediate resistant (BLNAI) strains + beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR) strains were 28.8% in period 1, 59.3% in period 2, 61.1% in period 3, 58.1% in period 4, and 63.5% in period 5, showing a rapid increase from period 1 to period 2 followed by an almost constant rate of approximately 60%. The proportion of ss-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains + ss-lactamase-producing clavulanic acid/amoxicillin-resistant (BLPACR) strains was 4.4% in period 3, which was somewhat low; however, there were no significant changes in the proportions of these strains, which ranged between 6.4% and 8.7% throughout the surveillance period except for period 3. The drugs whose MIC90 values against BLNAR strains were low throughout the surveillance included piperacillin (0.25 mug/mL) and tazobactam/piperacillin (0.125-0.25 mug/mL) in the penicillins; cefditoren and ceftriaxone (0.25-0.5 mug/mL for both) in the cephems; meropenem (0.5-1 mug/mL) and tebipenem (1 mug/mL) in the carbapenems; and levofloxacin, tosufloxacin, and garenoxacin (</= 0.06 mug/mL for all) and norfloxacin (0.06-0.125 mug/mL) in the quinolones. We investigated the relationship between the frequency of BLNAS strains/BLNAI + BLNAR strains and patients' background factors in each surveillance period. Significant differences were shown on age category (< 3 years or >/= 3 years) in all periods except period 4, and the presence/absence of prior administration of antimicrobial agents within one month in period 2 and period 3. In all periods, the frequency of BLNAI + BLNAR strains were higher in patients aged < 3 years than in patients aged >/= 3 years, and were also higher in patients with presence of prior treatment than in patients without prior treatment. We consider that it is important to promote the proper use of antimicrobial agents by conducting surveillance continuously in the future to clarify the relationship between the development of drug resistance in H. influenzae and patients' background factors and provide those information to clinical setting."
19949751,Real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction and melting temperature analysis for identification of clinically important Candida spp.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Invasive candidiasis is a major fungal infection occurring in patients who have prolonged hospital admissions. The rapid detection and confirmation of Candida spp. in clinical specimens is essential for efficient management and improved prognosis of these patients. The purpose of this study was to develop a real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the identification of Candida spp. commonly associated with invasive infections. METHODS: Using the LightCycler PCR System, the targets of genomic DNA isolated from the reference strains of 6 Candida spp. were amplified using genus- and species-specific primers, and detected in real-time employing SYBR Green fluorescent dye. The identity of Candida spp. was established by melting curve analysis. A similar analysis was performed with clinical isolates (n = 72) previously identified by conventional methods. RESULTS: The melting curve analysis of amplified DNA from the reference strains could differentiate between Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Candida dubliniensis. The specificity of the real-time PCR assay was validated by testing 72 clinical isolates of Candida spp. with 100% concordance, as compared with conventional identification methods. The notable findings of the study were differentiation of C. krusei from all other Candida spp. tested and of C. dubliniensis from C. albicans by melting temperature analysis; the latter 2 species share common phenotypic characteristics of germ-tube formation and chlamydospore production, so are often misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR using LightCycler and melting curve analysis are reliable methods for rapid identification of 6 Candida spp. frequently associated with candidemia and invasive candidiasis."
21067050,Outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia after induction therapy--3 years experience at a single paediatric oncology centre.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric malignancy. It represents 25% of all childhood cancers and approximately 75% of all cases of childhood leukaemia. A sharp peak of ALL incidence is observed at 2-5 years of age. Objective was to see the bone marrow remission pattern at the end of induction therapy in paediatric ALL patients in our setup. It was a Descriptive case series and conducted at Paediatric Oncology Department, Children Hospital complex Multan from December, 2005 to December, 2008. METHODS: Thirty-eight paediatric ALL patients were included in the study. Diagnosis was based on history, examination, blast cells count on peripheral blood film and bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping on peripheral blood/bone marrow aspirate. According to UK ALL 2003 protocol all patients were given 4-drug induction therapy, i.e., vincristine, prednisolone/dexamethasone, L-aspiragenase and daunomycin. Bone marrow biopsy was repeated at day 28 of induction therapy and remission pattern was seen. RESULTS: Out of 38 Patients, 26 (68%) were males. Age range was between 2-12 years (Mean 5.4 years). Bone Marrow Biopsy was done in 38 (100%) and Immunophenotyping in 34 (89%) patients. At day 28 of induction therapy, 28 (74%) patients went into complete remission (< 5% blast cells in bone marrow), 2 (5%) into partial remission (5-25% blast cells in bone marrow) and 1 (3%) was not in remission (> 25% blast cells in the bone marrow). Seven (18%) patient died due to febrile neutropenia and sepsis during the course of induction therapy. CONCLUSION: ALL in children is curable with effective chemotherapy. Remission can be achieved in most of these patients after induction therapy. However outcome can be improved with effective control of infections."
15732846,[Bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis following treatment of laryngeal carcinoma--a case report].,2004,"The authors present the case of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis, which was diagnosed in a patient after combined therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) because of laryngeal carcinoma. Thrombosis is the frequent complication and the second largest death cause from neoplasms. In review of the literature the cases of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis are uncommon. Jugular vein thrombosis has previously been reported in association with deep head and neck infections, sepsis, central vein catherization and the neck injuries. Because of that the presented case of internal jugular vein thrombosis seems to be interesting."
28979391,Depression following critical illness: Analysis of incidence and risk factors.,2015,"PURPOSE: Depression is common in ICU survivors and is known to negatively affect health-related quality of life. The reported risk factors for depression include increasing age, gender and hospital and ICU length of stay. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for depression in survivors of critical illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients attending the ICU Follow-up Clinic completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and data were also collected from their medical records. Risk factors investigated included age, gender, Apache II score, ICU length of stay and a diagnosis of sepsis during ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients participated, with 29 (46%) patients suffering with depression. On multivariable logistic regression, the only significant risk factor for depression was sepsis (p < 0.05, odds ratio: 6.8; 95% CI: 1.8-25.8). Age, gender and ICU length of stay were not found to be risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of potential causative factors as to why sepsis would cause long-term depression and this needs further investigation."
20046870,Cellular levels of HIV unspliced RNA from patients on combination antiretroviral therapy with undetectable plasma viremia predict the therapy outcome.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the standard of care for HIV-1 infection, is considered to be successful when plasma viremia remains below the detection limit of commercial assays. Yet, cART fails in a substantial proportion of patients after the apparent success. No laboratory markers are known that are predictive of cART outcome in initial responders during the period of undetectable plasma viremia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results of a retrospective longitudinal study of twenty-six HIV-infected individuals who initially responded to cART by having plasma viremia suppressed to <50 copies/ml. Eleven of these patients remained virologically suppressed, whereas fifteen experienced subsequent cART failure. Using sensitive methods based on seminested real-time PCR, we measured the levels of HIV-1 proviral (pr) DNA, unspliced (us) RNA, and multiply spliced RNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of these patients at multiple time points during the period of undetectable plasma viremia on cART. Median under-therapy level of usRNA was significantly higher (0.43 log(10) difference, P = 0.0015) in patients who experienced subsequent cART failure than in successfully treated patients. In multivariate analysis, adjusted for baseline CD4(+) counts, prior ART experience, and particular cART regimens, the maximal usRNA level under therapy was the best independent predictor of subsequent therapy failure (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 24.4 [1.5-389.5], P = 0.024). The only other factor significantly associated with cART failure was prior ART experience (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 12.3 [1.1-138.4], P = 0.042). Levels of usRNA under cART inversely correlated with baseline CD4(+) counts (P = 0.0003), but did not correlate with either baseline usRNA levels or levels of prDNA under therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the level of HIV-1 usRNA in PBMC, measured in cART-treated patients with undetectable plasma viremia, is a strong predictive marker for the outcome of therapy."
15599466,Clinical experiences of bacteremia caused by metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms.,2004,"The emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in gram-negative bacilli is regarded as a therapeutic challenge since such enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing all beta-lactams in vitro except the monobactams. The clinical characteristics and outcome of 8 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia caused by MBL-producing isolates from January 1997 through December 2000 (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 isolates; Pseudomonas stutzeri, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; and Pseudomonas putida, 1) were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 61 years (range, 2-95 years). Most patients (n = 6, 75%) had more than 1 comorbid illness or condition and 6 patients acquired bacteremia in the intensive care unit. The median time from admission to the first positive culture was 34.5 days (range, 1-99 days). Pneumonia was the most common site of infection. Five patients (62.5%) received a carbapenem to treat bacteremia. The median time to defervescence was 6 days (range, 2-12 days). No bacteriologic failure was noted during or after antimicrobial therapy. The overall mortality rate from bacteremia caused by gram-negative, MBL-producing organisms was nil at 14 or 28 days."
25514382,Molecular characterization and clonal relationships among Escherichia coli strains isolated from broiler chickens with colisepticemia.,2015,"This study characterized 52 Escherichia coli isolates from distinct diseased organs of 29 broiler chickens with clinical symptoms of colibacillosis in the Southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Thirty-eight isolates were highly virulent and 14 were virtually avirulent in 1-day-old chicks, yet all isolates harbored virulence factors characteristic of avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), including those related to adhesion, iron acquisition, and serum resistance. E. coli reference collection phylogenetic typing showed that isolates belonged mostly to group D (39%), followed by group A (29%), group B1 (17%), and group B2 (15%). Phylogenetic analyses using the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis and pulse-field gel electrophoresis methods were used to discriminate among isolates displaying the same serotype, revealing that five birds were infected with two distinct APEC strains. Among the 52 avian isolates, 2 were members of the pandemic E. coli O25:H4-B2-ST131 clone."
20028460,Minireview: Malassezia infections in immunocompromised patients.,2010,"Malassezia spp. form part of the normal human cutaneous flora and are implicated in several mild, but recurrent cutaneous diseases, such as pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia folliculitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, and, with lesser frequency, a range of other dermatological disorders. Malassezia spp. have also been associated with cutaneous and systemic diseases in immunocompromised patients including folliculitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, catheter-related fungaemia and a variety of deeply invasive infections. In this review, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of cutaneous and invasive Malassezia infections in immunocompromised patients."
41427863,PANCREATIC STONE PROTEIN (PSP) AS AN EARLY PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKER OF OUTCOME IN CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a major healthcare-associated infection, leading to severe complications. Early identification of patients at high risk for unfavorable outcome remains challenging. Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) has emerged as a promising biomarker in sepsis; however, its role in CDI has not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of adult patients with CDI from 13 hospitals in Greece. PSP was measured within 24 hours of CDI onset. Primary outcome was the association between PSP and unfavorable outcome, defined as at least one of the following: organ failure, severe disease progression, relapse, or death. ROC curve was performed to assess diagnostic performance, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate independent predictors of adverse outcome. RESULTS: 147 patients were enrolled, and unfavorable outcome occurred in 52. PSP levels were significantly higher in these patients. PSP showed an AUC 0.648 (95% CI 0.550-0.746, p=0.003) for predicting adverse outcome and an optimal cut-off of 300 ng/mL, increased the risk significantly (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.822-7.638, p<0.001). C-reactive protein (CRP) was also associated with adverse outcome (AUC 0.619, 95% CI: 0.512-0.726, p: 0.03), with an optimal cut-off >/=90 mg/l. Combined elevation of PSP and CRP conferred stronger prognostic value (OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.78-17.85, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, PSP >/=300 ng/ml (p: 0.006) and CRP >/=90 mg/l (p:0.04) remained independently associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating PSP in CDI. PSP, especially combined with CRP, may serve as complementary biomarkers for early risk stratification."
31954596,Rapid identification of the vanA/vanB resistance determinant in Enterococcus sp. from blood cultures using the Cepheid Xpert vanA/vanB cartridge system.,2020,"Especially in immunocompromised and intensive care patients VRE sepsis is associated with high mortality. The GeneXpert vanA/vanB assay is marketed for fast molecular surveillance of VRE colonization in peri-anal and rectal swabs. The aim of this study was to evaluate this assay for its usefulness for rapid identification of the vanAB determinant from positive blood cultures. During an evaluation phase, 33/34 blood cultures (negative = 13; vanA = 1; and vanB = 19) were correctly identified. In the validation phase 205/211 blood cultures were correctly identified (negative, n = 160; vanA, n = 2; vanB, n = 43). Sensitivity and specificity calculated from valid tests was 100% (95% CI: 90.2-100%) and 100% (95% CI: 97.1-100%), respectively. The error rate was 2.8%. The Xpert vanA/vanB cartridge is a reliable tool in the rapid molecular identification of the vanA and vanB determinant from positive blood cultures with moderate inhibition rates (2.8%) and high PPV and NPV. However, additional methods for species identification are required."
20042498,Inability of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to directly lyse HIV-infected autologous CD4+ T cells despite induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.,2010,"The function of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) in chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remains controversial with regard to its potential for sustained alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) production and induction of PDC-dependent tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated cytotoxicity of HIV-infected cells. We address these areas by a study of chronically HIV-1-infected subjects followed through antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption and by testing PDC cytolytic function against autologous HIV-infected CD4(+) T cells. Rebound in viremia induced by therapy interruption showed a positive association between TRAIL and viral load or T-cell activation, but comparable levels of plasma IFN-alpha/beta were found in viremic ART-treated and control subjects. While PDC from HIV-infected subjects expressed less interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF-7) and produced significantly less IFN-alpha upon Toll-like receptor 7/9 (TLR7/9) engagement than controls, membrane TRAIL expression in PDC from HIV(+) subjects was increased. Moreover, no significant increase in death receptor 5 (DR5) expression was seen in CD4(+) T cells from viremic HIV(+) subjects compared to controls or following in vitro infection/exposure to infectious and noninfectious virus or exogenous IFN-alpha, respectively. Although activated PDC killed the DR5-expressing HIV-infected Sup-T1 cell line, PDC did not lyse primary autologous HIV(+) CD4(+) T cells yet could provide accessory help for NK cells in killing HIV-infected autologous CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, our data show a lack of sustained high levels of soluble IFN-alpha in chronic HIV-1 infection in vivo and document a lack of direct PDC cytolytic activity against autologous infected or uninfected CD4(+) T cells."
19949071,Requisite role of the cholinergic alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pathway in suppressing Gram-negative sepsis-induced acute lung inflammatory injury.,2010,"Although activation of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) modulates the response to sepsis, the role of this pathway in the development of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is not known. In this study, we addressed the contribution of alpha7 nAChR in mediating endotoxin- and live Escherichia coli-induced ALI in mice. Because we found that alpha7 nAChR(+) alveolar macrophages and neutrophils were present in bronchoalveolar lavage and injured lungs of mice, we tested whether acetylcholine released by lung vagal innervation stimulated these effector cells and thereby down-regulated proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine generation. Administration of alpha7 nAChR agonists reduced bronchoalveolar lavage MIP-2 production and transalveolar neutrophil migration and reduced mortality in E. coli pneumonia mice, whereas vagal denervation increased MIP-2 production and airway neutrophil accumulation and increased mortality. In addition, alpha7 nAChR(-/-) mice developed severe lung injury and had higher mortality compared with alpha7 nAChR(+/+) mice. The immunomodulatory cholinergic alpha7 nAChR pathway of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils blocked LPS- and E. coli-induced ALI by reducing chemokine production and transalveolar neutrophil migration, suggesting that activation of alpha7 nAChR may be a promising strategy for treatment of sepsis-induced ALI."
19967894,[Polyspecialistic treatment of a polytrauma. Case report].,2009,"The Authors report the clinical course of M.L., a 22 years old man. He came to our observation after a road accident, in third care. In the former hospital admissions hemodynamic stabilization, surgical haemostasis of multiple hepatic lacerations with hemoperitoneum and right leg amputation were performed. He arrived to our department in a critical condition owing to mild respiratory insufficiency due to many rib fractures with sero-haematic spillage into the pleural cavity, in dialytic treatment for acute renal insufficiency consequent to right renal artery damage, soft tissues necrosis of the amputation stump with sepsis and persistent fever until 40 degrees C. The treatment and care of this patient required a team-work with the collaboration of many specialists, namely surgeons, nephrologists, anaesthetists, interventionist radiologists and hyperbaric oxygen therapy experts. Thanks to such collaboration we achieved an excellent quoad vitam result. The aim of this paper is to confirm and emphasize the central role of a Trauma Team, fed in a Trauma Center and in a Trauma System, in the management of complex traumas."
41461922,Microbial collagenase activity is linked to oral-gut translocation in advanced chronic liver disease.,2026,"Microbiome perturbations are associated with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD), but how microorganisms contribute to disease mechanisms is unclear. Here we analysed metagenomes of paired saliva and faecal samples from an ACLD cohort of 86 individuals, plus 2 control groups of 52 healthy individuals and 14 patients with sepsis. We identified highly similar oral and gut bacterial strains, including Veillonella and Streptococcus spp., which increased in absolute abundance in the gut of patients with ACLD compared with controls. These microbial translocators uniquely share a prtC gene encoding a collagenase-like proteinase, and its faecal abundance was a robust ACLD biomarker (area under precision-recall curve = 0.91). A mouse model of hepatic fibrosis inoculated with Veillonella and Streptococcus prtC-encoding patient isolates showed exacerbation of gut barrier impairment and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, faecal collagenase activity was increased in patients with ACLD and experimentally confirmed for the prtC gene of translocating Veillonella parvula. These findings establish mechanistic links between oral-gut translocation and ACLD pathobiology."
15598967,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in febrile neutropenic patients with bacteremia.,2005,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacodynamic investigations with antimicrobials define the relationship between the infecting organism and achievable drug concentrations with clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To examine this relationship for meropenem in a population of patients who are at high risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis of a multicenter, randomized, blinded clinical trial. A population-based predictive model was created using data from adults with febrile neutropenia and the nonparametric modeling program, NPEM. Patient age, body weight, and serum creatinine level were covariates in the model used to predict unbound concentrations for each patient. Pathogen susceptibility was estimated using product literature minimum inhibitory concentrations for effectiveness against 50% of microorganisms (MIC50) for specific organisms. The pharmacodynamic index of percent time above MIC (% T>MIC) was analyzed for its association with clinical outcome. RESULTS: A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model using patient covariates of body weight and renal function best described the pharmacokinetics of meropenem in febrile neutropenic patients. Sixty patients with confirmed gram-positive or -negative bacteremia were studied. An average of 83% T>MIC was identified for the 42 clinical responders compared with 59% T>MIC for the 18 nonresponders (p = 0.04). An 80% clinical response rate was evident when the % T>MIC for meropenem exceeded 75% of the dosing interval (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first published report of a relationship between a pharmacodynamic index and clinical outcome in a febrile neutropenic population. Based on this relationship, dosing with intravenous meropenem 500 mg every 6 hours is predicted to be comparable to the currently recommended 1 g every 8 hours for serious infections. Our model provides further justification for a prospective clinical trial to evaluate a pharmacodynamically targeted meropenem dosing schedule as to its ability to improve clinical outcome in these patients."
20003078,Inhibition of p38 MAPK improves intestinal disturbances and oxidative stress induced in a rabbit endotoxemia model.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreases intestinal contractility and induces the release of reactive oxygen species, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) can be activated by a variety of stimuli such as LPS. The aims of this study were: (i) to investigate the role of p38 MAPK in the effect of LPS on (a) the acetylcholine, prostaglandin E(2) and KCl-induced contractions of rabbit duodenum and (b) the oxidative stress status; (ii) to localize the active form of p38 in the intestine. METHODS: Rabbits were injected with (i) saline, (ii) LPS, (iii) SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor or (iv) SB203580 + LPS. Duodenal contractility was studied in an organ bath. SB203580 was also tested in vitro. The protein expression of p-p38 and total p38 was measured by Western blot and p-p38 was localized by immunohistochemistry. The formation of products of oxidative damage to proteins (carbonyls) and lipids (MDA+4-HDA) was quantified in intestine and plasma. KEY RESULTS: ACh, PGE(2) and KCl-induced contractions decreased with LPS. LPS increased phospho-p38 expression and the levels of carbonyls and MDA+4-HDA. SB203580 blocked the effect of LPS on the ACh, PGE(2) and KCl-induced contractions in vivo and in vitro and the levels of carbonyls and MDA+4-HDA. P-p38 was detected in neurons of the myenteric plexus and smooth muscle cells of duodenum. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Lipopolysaccharide decreases the duodenal contractility in rabbits and increases the production of free radicals. p38 MAPK is a mediator of these effects."
41472638,"Diagnostic Performance of Biomarkers Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, and Procalcitonin in Neonatal Sepsis: A Case-Control Study.",2025,"Neonatal sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with diagnosis complicated by nonspecific clinical signs and limited reliability of conventional laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT) with traditional sepsis screening parameters in neonates. This hospital-based case-control study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a North Indian tertiary care medical university between September 2023 and March 2025. A total of 300 neonates were screened, of which 100 were diagnosed with sepsis (cases) and the remaining 200 served as controls. Sepsis screening, TNF-alpha, IL-6, PCT, and blood culture were performed to diagnose neonatal sepsis. Results of this study showed significantly higher levels of all tested biomarkers and sepsis parameters in cases compared with controls. Among biomarkers, TNF-alpha demonstrated the highest accuracy [area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.99, sensitivity 94%, specificity 100%], followed by PCT (AUROC 0.82, sensitivity 80%, specificity 82.5%) and IL-6 (AUROC 0.79, sensitivity 86%, specificity 74.5%). The study concludes that TNF-alpha is the most reliable biomarker for diagnosing neonatal sepsis, although a multimodal approach integrating conventional parameters with cytokines and PCT offers the best diagnostic yield. Combining early biomarkers with standard screening may improve early recognition, reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, and strengthen antimicrobial stewardship."
20803910,An assessment of accuracy of mothers' presumptive diagnosis of fever at home in southwest Nigeria: evidence for switch to parasite-based diagnostic test.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: Home management of malaria (HMM) strategy was based on presumptive diagnosis of malaria and use of correct dose of chloroquine. However, the development of chloroquine resistant parasites in most endemic areas necessitated the recommendation of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT); and this has been demonstrated to be effective in HMM. However, the recommendation that ACT should be dispensed only to laboratory confirmed cases underscores the need to review the accuracy of mothers' presumptive diagnosis and provide evidence for a switch to parasite based diagnostic test. METHODS: This was a follow-up study nested to a larger controlled intervention study carried out to assess the effect of malaria treatment guideline on mothers' adherence to correct treatment of malaria in children. In a subset, thick blood smears were prepared from finger prick blood samples of febrile children who have been presumptively diagnosed to have malaria by mothers on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 to detect parasitaemia. The presumed diagnosis was compared with the presence of parasitaemia. RESULTS: A total of 162 children with febrile illness (88 and 74 in intervention and control groups respectively) were studied. Sixty-four (72.7%) and 62 (83.8%) of the febrile cases presumed to have malaria in the intervention and control groups respectively had parasitaemia on Day 0. The sensitivity and specificity of mothers' diagnoses was 78.1% and 29.2%; 82.3% and 8.3%; in the intervention and control groups respectively. CONCLUSION: The low specificity of presumptive diagnosis has implication for the deployment of ACT at the community level in Nigeria. This supports current views on the need for a more sensitive and specific parasite-based diagnosis of malaria before ACT treatment. Further study to compare presumptive diagnosis of malaria with malaria diagnostic test carried out at the community level is needed to inform policy on the adoption of parasite based malaria diagnosis at community level."
41426368,The utility of C-reactive protein in neonatal early-onset sepsis screening: A territory-wide cohort analysis.,2025,"IMPORTANCE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a commonly used biomarker for sepsis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate CRP's diagnostic performance to detect neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), while accounting for both gestational and postnatal age. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of neonates born from January 2006 to December 2017 in public hospitals in Hong Kong. Neonates who had CRP tested within 72 h of birth, prior to antibiotics initiation, were included. CRP values were analyzed by gestational age and time after birth. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS: Among 100 327 tested neonates, 448 developed culture-confirmed EOS, and 34 had meningitis. In uninfected neonates, CRP concentrations rose naturally after 8 h of life, peaking at 24-32 h, with higher values in term neonates at 24-48 h (median 6.2 mg/L, interquartile range 2.9-14.3). Diagnostic performance was better in preterm neonates (e.g., the area under the ROC curve after 4 h of life: 0.88 in <34 weeks, 0.83-0.92 in 34-36 weeks, and 0.73-0.77 in term neonates). Sensitivity within the first 4 h was low across all groups. LRs increased with higher CRP values in preterm neonates. A CRP value of >12.0 mg/L was associated with increased risk of meningitis. INTERPRETATION: CRP is not recommended for EOS screening in term neonates, but it may be considered for assessing the risk of EOS in preterm neonates. Interpretation must account for gestational and postnatal age."
41449431,Association between serum osmolality trajectories and mortality in sepsis patients: a retrospective multi-cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis commonly leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, often reflected in abnormal serum osmolality. Although static measurements of osmolality have been investigated, the prognostic significance of dynamic changes in serum osmolality over time remains poorly understood in patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 22,737 septic patients from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, with external validation performed using an independent cohort of 303 patients from Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital. Latent class trajectory modeling was applied to identify distinct patterns of serum osmolality during the first 4 days in the ICU. The association between trajectory patterns and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Mediation analysis was employed to explore potential biological mechanisms, while parametric g-formula simulations were used to evaluate the impact of trajectory-specific fluid management strategies. RESULTS: Three distinct serum osmolality trajectories were identified: stable (ST), ascending (AS), and descending (DS). Compared to the ST group, both the AS and DS groups were associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.61-2.01 for AS; HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.62-2.06 for DS). Mediation analysis indicated that renal dysfunction (accounting for 11.16% of the total effect, P < 0.001) and cumulative positive fluid balance (11.39%, P < 0.001) partially mediated the observed associations. Parametric g-formula simulations revealed substantial heterogeneity in responses to fluid management across trajectory groups, with optimal fluid strategies varying significantly by trajectory pattern and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Dynamic serum osmolality trajectories are independent predictors of mortality in sepsis, with effects partially mediated through renal dysfunction and fluid imbalance. These findings support the implementation of trajectory-guided precision fluid therapy as a novel framework for individualized sepsis care, challenging one-size-fits-all approaches and offering evidence-based guidance for personalized treatment strategies."
41407497,Glucose-6-phosphate transporter deficiency (GSD type Ib) in an infant with an ominous outcome.,2025,"A male infant presented with progressive abdominal distension, diarrhoea, fever and respiratory distress. Examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, doll-like facies, thin extremities and oral/perianal rash. His history included recurrent pneumonia. By day six, he developed severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, requiring mechanical ventilation. Despite antibiotic therapy, he suffered persistent infections including sepsis, UTI and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Genetic testing confirmed glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib), identifying a homozygous splice site variant in intron 9 of the SLC37A4 gene. This case highlights the immune dysfunction-neutropenia and neutrophil impairment-associated with GSD-Ib, contributing to increased infection susceptibility and poor response to treatment. Genetic counselling and prenatal testing were recommended."
20083873,Primary aorto-enteric fistula: a rare complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,2009,"A 70-year-old lady presented with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia caused by multiple enteric pathogens. She was diagnosed to have primary aorto-enteric fistula (PAEF) complicating abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular aneurysm repair was carried out that arrested gastrointestinal bleeding, but despite prolonged antibiotic therapy the patient died a month later of probable sepsis. PAEF refers to abnormal communication between the aorta and the intestine resulting from disease at either site; this rare condition should be suspected in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm who present with unexplained life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. Computerized tomography is the most sensitive investigation. Presence of ectopic gas adjacent to or within the aorta and of contrast within the gastrointestinal tract is the pathognomonic finding. Definitive treatment consists of surgical intervention, but it is associated with high risk in the acute setting. Endovascular therapy using stent-grafts is safe and effective in arresting gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it is frequently associated with recurrent sepsis even with continued antibiotic therapy, and should be considered as a bridge to more definitive surgical repair at a later time, after optimization of the patient's condition."
41458497,Lactate and procalcitonin combined with qSOFA score for the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in ICU patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and early prognostic assessment is essential for improving outcomes. Although the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is widely used for bedside risk stratification, its standalone predictive performance is limited. Integrating biochemical markers such as lactate and procalcitonin (PCT) may improve prognostic accuracy. This study was designed to evaluate the combined value of qSOFA, lactate, and PCT in assessing disease severity and mortality risk, and to clarify the prognostic utility of dynamic monitoring at multiple time points. METHODS: This retrospective study included 128 ICU patients with sepsis, categorized into qSOFA < 2 (n = 57) and qSOFA >/= 2 (n = 71) groups. Lactate and PCT levels were recorded at ICU admission (T0), 24 h (T24), and 72 h (T72). ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and multiple organ failure rates were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with adjustment for age, hypertension, and SOFA score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive performance of qSOFA alone and in combination with the biomarkers. RESULTS: Patients with qSOFA >/= 2 had significantly higher ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05) and exhibited consistently elevated lactate and PCT levels at all three time points (P < 0.01). qSOFA, lactate, and PCT were independent predictors of both ICU and 28-day mortality (P < 0.05). The combined model demonstrated superior discrimination, with AUCs of 0.79 for ICU mortality and 0.81 for 28-day mortality, outperforming qSOFA alone or qSOFA paired with a single biomarker. CONCLUSION: A qSOFA score >/= 2 identifies patients at higher risk of mortality. Dynamic monitoring of lactate and PCT significantly enhances early prognostic evaluation, and their combined use with qSOFA provides improved risk stratification for ICU patients with sepsis."
25616588,Transient false-positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin in septic shock.,2015,"Point-of-care testing for urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) allows rapid diagnosis of pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders at the bedside. Urine hCG test kits use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology and incorporate 2 types of monoclonal antibody in a sandwich structure. There have been case reports in a variety of disease states reporting interference with this method leading to false-positive results. We describe the case of a nonpregnant female presenting to the emergency department with septic shock secondary to severe colitis. Three sequential urine tests using the Clearview hCG test kit (Alere Limited, Stockport, United Kingdom) yielded positive results, whereas quantitative serum analysis was negative for hCG. This initial test result reverted to a true-negative result after 48 hours, suggesting the transient passage of an interferent into the urine at the time of initial testing. This may have been a molecule produced as part of the host inflammatory response or from bacterial synthesis of an interferent with hCG-like antigenic structure. It is important that clinicians are aware of the mechanisms and limitations of urine hCG testing and maintain a low threshold to undertake early serum hCG testing to confirm diagnosis."
41439929,Sepsis and the Liver.,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a critical and often early complication of sepsis, defined by distinct hyper-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases that shape patient phenotypes. METHODS: Characterizing these phases establishes a foundation for immunomodulation strategies tailored to individual immune responses, as discussed subsequently. RESULTS: The initial inflammatory response activates pathways such as NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to a cytokine storm that damages hepatocytes and is frequently associated with higher SOFA scores and a higher risk of 28-day mortality. Kupffer cells and infiltrating neutrophils exacerbate hepatic injury by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, thereby causing cellular damage and prolonging ICU stays. During the subsequent immunosuppressive phase, impaired infection control and tissue repair can result in recurrent hospital-acquired infections and a poorer prognosis. Concurrently, hepatocytes undergo significant metabolic disturbances, notably impaired fatty acid oxidation due to downregulation of transcription factors such as PPARalpha and HNF4alpha. This metabolic alteration corresponds with worsening liver function tests, which may reflect the severity of liver failure in clinical practice. Mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by oxidative stress and defective autophagic quality control, impairs cellular energy production and induces hepatocyte death, which is closely linked to declining liver function and increased mortality. The gut-liver axis plays a central role in SALI pathogenesis, as sepsis-induced gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability allow bacterial products, including lipopolysaccharides, to enter the portal circulation and further inflame the liver. This process is associated with sepsis-related liver failure and greater reliance on vasopressor support. Protective microbial metabolites, such as indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), decrease significantly during sepsis, removing key anti-inflammatory signals and potentially prolonging recovery. Clinically, SALI most commonly presents as septic cholestasis with elevated bilirubin and mild transaminase changes, although conventional liver function tests are insufficiently sensitive for early detection. Novel biomarkers, including protein panels and non-coding RNAs, as well as dynamic liver function tests such as LiMAx (currently in phase II diagnostics) and ICG-PDR, offer promise for improved diagnosis and prognostication. Specifying the developmental stage of these biomarkers, such as identifying LiMAx as phase II, informs investment priorities and translational readiness. Current management is primarily supportive, emphasizing infection control and organ support. Investigational therapies include immunomodulation tailored to immune phenotypes, metabolic and mitochondrial-targeted agents such as pemafibrate and dichloroacetate, and interventions to restore gut microbiota balance, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, translational challenges remain due to limitations of animal models and patient heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Future research should focus on developing representative models, validating biomarkers, and conducting clinical trials to enable personalized therapies that modulate inflammation, restore metabolism, and repair the gut-liver axis, with the goal of improving outcomes in SALI."
20095181,Focus on sepsis and intensive care.,2009,"The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines collate the evidence for managing sepsis. Most of the interventions suggested by the SSC guidelines are very relevant to military critical care, including rapid microbiologic investigation, early antibiotic administration and many aspects of early goal directed therapy. Other interventions may be more difficult to provide in remote theatres of operation where resources may be limited. This article discusses the application of the SSC guidelines to deployed military hospitals, with suggestions as to which interventions are feasible, and which may not be indicated."
20046115,Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: risk factors and prevention.,2009,"Intensive care unit-acquired weakness, the main clinical sign of critical illness neuromyopathy, is an increasingly recognized cause of prolonged mechanical ventilation and delayed return to physical self-sufficiency. Identifying risk factors and developing preventive measures are therefore important goals. Several studies on risk factors for critical illness neuromyopathy including prospective observational studies with a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors were conducted over the last decade. A large body of data is also available from two large prospective randomized trials comparing the effect of strict vs. conventional blood-glucose control on intensive care unit mortality and on secondary outcomes including the occurrence of critical illness neuromyopathy. Five central risk factors and their related potential measures to prevent intensive care unit-acquired weakness can be identified including multiple organ failure, muscle inactivity, hyperglycemia, and use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers. Although strong evidence regarding the efficacy of preventive measures is still lacking, the results of available studies are promising and cast doubt on the widespread belief that the treatment of intensive care unit-acquired weakness is essentially supportive. Early identifying and treating conditions leading to multiple organ failure, especially severe sepsis and septic shock, avoiding unnecessary deep sedation and excessive blood glucose levels, promoting early mobilization, and carefully weighing the risks and benefits of corticosteroids might contribute to reduce the incidence and severity of intensive care unit-acquired weakness."
41670969,Prognostic Impact and Risk Factors of Septic Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Septic Shock: An Observational Study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify risk factors associated with septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) in patients diagnosed with septic shock and to assess differences in clinical outcomes between those with septic shock alone and those with concomitant SCM. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 108 patients diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, between December 2022 and July 2024. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of SCM: the non-SCM group (n = 90) and the SCM group (n = 18). Baseline characteristics, laboratory markers, cardiac function indices, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify risk factors for SCM. Within the SCM group, outcomes were further analyzed according to survival status to assess the association between cardiac function recovery and mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of SCM among patients with septic shock was 16.67%. Compared with the non-SCM group, the SCM group showed a significantly higher prevalence of urinary tract infections and a history of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05). Higher scores were observed for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scales, along with increased levels of admission-day troponin I, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, maximum lactic acid (LACmax), maximum brain natriuretic peptide, and peak troponin I (p < 0.05). In contrast, mean arterial pressure at admission, minimum left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and end-point LVEF (LVEFend%) were significantly lower in this group (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified elevated IL-1 levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14), higher APACHE II scores (OR = 1.13), and increased LACmax (OR = 1.47) as risk factors for SCM (p < 0.05). The presence of SCM was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality and increased healthcare costs (p < 0.05). Among patients with SCM, recovery of LVEF and cardiac output was correlated with improved survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: Elevated IL-1 levels, increased peak lactic acid concentration, and higher APACHE II scores were associated with the development of SCM in patients with septic shock. SCM was further associated with increased mortality and greater healthcare resource utilization. Restoration of cardiac function, particularly improvements in LVEF and cardiac output, was correlated with improved prognosis and may serve as a valuable indicator of clinical outcomes."
32165950,Mortality Prediction of Microalbuminuria in Septic Patients.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Huge number of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers is produced during the process of sepsis. Its mortality prediction value needs to be determined. AIM: To assess the prognostic value of Albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) in septic patients and its ability to predict mortality in comparison with Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHE II). METHODS: Seventy-five Septic patients were included within 24 hours of sepsis diagnosis and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). ACR values were obtained within 6 hours of ICU admission for all patients. Prognostic scoring systems [APACHE II and Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores] were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty percent of enrolled patients died within 28 days of hospital admission. ACR was significantly higher in non-survivor in comparison to survivors (55.1 +/- 20.5 versus 30.2 +/- 35.7, p = 0.006). ACR >/= 40 (mg/gm creatinine) was the cut-off point for predicting mortality with a sensitivity of 90.7% and specificity of 71.8% with total accuracy of 66% and AUC 0.75 (CI 0.62-0.88). Mean APACHE II score was significantly higher in non-survivors than survivor groups (21.4 versus 10.8, p < 0.001). ACR was positively correlated with highest SOFA score (r = 0.3, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACR is a simple prognostic marker in septic patient and could be used as a mortality predictor, particularly in early (within 6 hours) septic patients."
31843296,A case report of catheter-related bloodstream infection due to Trichosporon coremiiforme in a patient with secondary neutropenia to HIV.,2020,"Here, we describe an invasive infection due to Trichosporon coremiiforme in an HIV positive patient with neutropenia. The strain was first erroneously identified as Trichosporon asahii by conventional methods, but correctly identified by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight technology (MALDI-TOF MS) and ribosomal DNA sequencing. The infection was successfully resolved after antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and fluconazole. This case report is a contribution to the study of T. coremiiforme infections and reinforces its relevance as a species capable of causing invasive human infection in immunocompromised patients and also contributes to the study of its susceptibility profile against antifungal drugs."
25658542,Strong and persistent correlation between baseline and follow-up HIV-DNA levels and residual viremia in a population of naive patients with more than 4 years of effective antiretroviral therapy.,2015,"In a longitudinal study on 181 naive patients who responded to therapy (mean follow-up 4 years), high baseline human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-RNA values correlated with high levels of cellular HIV-DNA at all time points (p < 0.0001, p 0.045, p 0.0055, and p 0.0025, respectively) and negatively correlated with undetectable residual viremia (URV; <2.5 copies/mL) at T1, T2, and T3 (p 0.026, p 0.0149, and p 0.0002, respectively). Baseline high HIV-DNA levels predicted the persistence of high values (p 0.0001) and negatively correlated with URV (p 0.0254, p 0.0481, and p 0.0085). These results suggest that baseline viral load, cellular HIV-DNA, and URV were strongly correlated over long-term follow-up of antiretroviral therapy responders."
25504120,[Application of advanced neuroimaging in motor rehabilitation].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive technique that allows mapping and visualizing of brain connectivity networks. The hemiparesis after a stroke is a good biological model to study changes in brain connectivity. This model can be expanded if information is obtained before and after neurorehabilitation therapy. OBJECTIVE: To present the functional neuroimaging findings in a patient with stroke before and after performing neurorehabilitation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of the neurorehabilitation protocol, resonance imaging was performed before and after treatment with an equipment operating at 1.5 T. Volumetric T1-weighted images, diffusion images for tractography, functional resonance images with the patient at rest and with the patient performing pincer movement with the right hand were obtained. RESULTS: Functional maps before and after therapy were obtained, which are presented together with structural connectivity images obtained by tractography. Clinical changes can be seen accompanied by changes in activation patterns obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: The versatility of magnetic resonance imaging allows further knowledge of the structural and functional state of the brain generating new possibilities for diagnosis and prognosis in patients undergoing neurorehabilitation therapy. Neurological rehabilitation processes can be quantified and they can reveal certain postlesional neuroplasticity dynamic processes that the central nervous system possesses."
25714201,Aortic Center: specialized care improves outcomes and decreases mortality.,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To compare in-hospital outcomes in aortic surgery in our cardiac surgery unit, before and after foundation of our Center for Aortic Surgery (CTA). METHODS: Prospective cohort with non-concurrent control. Foundation of CTA required specialized training of surgical, anesthetic and intensive care unit teams, routine neurological monitoring, endovascular and hybrid facilities, training of the support personnel, improvement of the registry and adoption of specific protocols. We included 332 patients operated on between: January/2003 to December/2007 (before-CTA, n=157, 47.3%); and January/2008 to December/2010 (CTA, n=175, 52.7%). Baseline clinical and demographic data, operative variables, complications and in-hospital mortality were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Mean age was 58+/-14 years, with 65% male. Group CTA was older, had higher rate of diabetes, lower rates of COPD and HF, more non-urgent surgeries, endovascular procedures, and aneurysms. In the univariate analysis, CTA had lower mortality (9.7 vs. 23.0%, P=0.008), which occurred consistently across different diseases and procedures. Other outcomes which were reduced in CTA included lower rates of reinterventions (5.7 vs 11%, P=0.046), major complications (20.6 vs. 33.1%, P=0.007), stroke (4.6 vs. 10.9%, P=0.045) and sepsis (1.7 vs. 9.6%, P=0.001), as compared to before-CTA. Multivariable analysis adjusted for potential confounders revealed that CTA was independently associated with mortality reduction (OR=0.23, IC 95% 0.08 - 0.67, P=0.007). CTA independent mortality reduction was consistent in the multivariable analysis stratified by disease (aneurysm, OR=0.18, CI 95% 0.03 - 0.98, P=0.048; dissection, OR=0.31, CI 95% 0.09 - 0.99, P=0.049) and by procedure (hybrid, OR=0.07, CI 95% 0.007 - 0.72, P=0.026; Bentall, OR=0.18, CI 95% 0.038 - 0.904, P=0.037). Additional multivariable predictors of in-hospital mortality included creatinine (OR=1.7 [1.1-2.6], P=0.008), urgent surgery (OR=5.0 [1.5-16.7], P=0.008) and thoracoabdominal aneurysm (OR=24.6 [3.1-194.1], P=0.002). CONCLUSION: Thoracic aorta surgery in specialized center was associated with lower incidence of complications and all-cause mortality as compared to usual care."
17304747,[Risk of HIV-1 or 2 infection associated with transfusion in Benin].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the residual risk of transmission of HIV 1/2 infection through transfusion of seronegative blood. METHODS: This study was carried out between January and July 2000. It was based on eight hundred and twenty-one (821) blood donors screened negative for HIV antibodies by ELISA using Vironostika Uni-form II plus 0 (Organon Teknika). 675 (82.2%) were men and 146 (17.8%) women all aged between 18 and 56 years with a mean age of 25.5 +/- 7.8 years. Serum aliquots of these seronegative blood donor were frozen and further tested with two tests: Enzymun-Test HIV Combi (Roche Immunodiagnostics) and Murex HIV Antigen Mab (Murex). RESULTS: Twenty six out of 821 (3.2%) seronegative specimens were repeatedly reactive for Enzymun-test. All were tested negative once again for anti-HIV antibodies by ELISA using Vironostika Uni-form II/plus 0. Out of these 26, only one was repeatedly reactive for Murex. For further analysis of the 25 donors tested negative for Murex, only 9 came back for another donation five months later. All of them were tested negative for anti-HIV antibodies by ELISA (Vironostika). CONCLUSION: Our study shows the existence of residual risk of transmission of HIV1/2 infection associated with transfusion of seronegative blood donors. This risk was higher in our countries compared with industrialised nations. Therefore implementing strategies should be a priority to avoid the residual risk and improve blood transfusion safety."

25722876,Septic encephalopathy: when cytokines interact with acetylcholine in the brain.,2014,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a brain dysfunction that occurs secondary to infection in the body, characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. SAE involves a number of mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, in which the interaction between cytokines and acetylcholine results in neuronal loss and alterations in cholinergic signaling. Moreover, the interaction also occurs in the periphery, accelerating a type of immunosuppressive state. Although its diagnosis is not specific in biochemistry and imaging tests, it could potentiate severe outcomes, including increased mortality, cognitive decline, progressive immunosuppression, cholinergic anti-inflammatory deficiency, and even metabolic and hydroelectrolyte imbalance. Therefore, the bilateral communication between SAE and the multiple peripheral organs and especially the immune system should be emphasized in sepsis management."
20024639,Troponins and high-sensitivity troponins as markers of necrosis in CAD and heart failure.,2009,"For years, cardiac troponins (cTn) have been regarded as the preferred biomarkers for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes, as well as for the selection of patients who need an early invasive strategy, and for the guidance of adjunctive pharmacological therapy. In addition, measurement of cTn has been found useful for detection of myocardial necrosis in conditions unrelated to myocardial ischemia including acute pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, heart failure, sepsis, and end-stage renal disease. In these conditions, an unfavorable prognosis is unequivocally associated with detectable concentrations of cTn.A major limitation of most currently available cTn assays is the lack of adequate precision, i.e., to measure cTn concentrations at the 99th percentile value with a coefficient of variation < 10%. As a consequence, many manufacturers have developed more sensitive cTn assays that now comply with precision criteria required by the Joint European Society of Cardiology/ American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation Task Force for the Redefinition of Acute Myocardial Infarction.Using assays with higher analytic sensitivity more patients will be seen in clinical practice with the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (TnThs) above the 99th percentile discriminator. The causes of these elevations may be due to acute, subacute and chronic cardiac disease such as heart failure or cardiomyopathies."
41431768,Evaluation of the distribution and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bloodstream infection isolates of patients hospitalised in a tertiary care centre in western Turkey.,2025,"This study aims to evaluate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance profiles of microorganisms isolated from blood cultures of patients hospitalised in intensive care units and wards of our hospital over a 2-year period, in light of European antimicrobial resistance data and country surveillance data. Blood cultures sent to the microbiology laboratory from the wards and intensive care units of our hospital between December 2020 and 2022 were retrospectively evaluated from the hospital automation system. The identification and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were done by the Phoenix 100 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The results of antibiotic susceptibility were evaluated according to the criteria of the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The blood culture results of 872 patients with pathogenic bacterial growth in their blood cultures were examined and evaluated. Taking into account World Health Organisation (WHO) surveillance reports, it appears that our hospital's antimicrobial resistance rates were higher than those reported by our country's data. Resistance profiles vary from country to country, city to city, and even among different hospitals in the same city. Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, even at the hospital level, will contribute to programs to combat antimicrobial resistance both across the country and all around the world."
15611906,[Uncommon position of a retropharyngeal impacted fishbone].,2004,"The case of a 34-year-old otherwise healthy woman with retropharyngeal abscess due to a fishbone injury and presenting with neck stiffness and aphagia without visualization of a pharyngeal mucosal lesion is reported. The case illustrates that sore throat with symptoms out of proportion to oropharyngeal findings should prompt a search for pathologies other than simple pharyngotonsillitis. Other typical symptoms of a retropharyngeal abscess are high fever, dysphagia, hot potato voice and, less commonly, dyspnea and sepsis. Retropharyngeal abscess in adults occurs most often as a complication of a spread of infection from a pharyngeal focus, a foreign body injury, an iatrogenic trauma due to tracheal intubation or endoscopy, and blunt or perforating neck trauma. Contrary to children, a retropharyngeal abscess in adults without loco-regional infection or preceding trauma is very rare. This case illustrates how important imaging investigations (CT-scan) are in order to locate foreign bodies and to decide on surgical management. Aetiology, presenting signs, symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment and complications of a retropharyngeal abscess are briefly discussed."
31816865,Clinical Significance of MicroRNAs in Patients with Sepsis: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response that leads to organ dysfunction and has high mortality rates despite recent therapeutic advancements. Accurate diagnosis and risk stratification are important for effective sepsis treatment; however, no decisive diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers are currently available. To understand whether microRNA (miRNA) might be useful biomarkers of sepsis, we aim to assess the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of three miRNAs (122, 150, and 223) in sepsis patients via a meta-analysis of relevant published data. We will search electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for pertinent retrospective and prospective studies in October 2019. Two reviewers will evaluate the collected titles, abstracts, and full articles, and extract the data. We will assess the included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. If feasible, we will use bivariate random effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) models to estimate summary ROCs, pooled sensitivity and specificity values, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We will evaluate heterogeneity via clinical and methodological subgroup and sensitivity analyses. This systematic review will clarify the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of select miRNAs in sepsis. It may also identify knowledge gaps in sepsis' diagnosis and prognosis."
32065817,Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli sepsis from a neonatal intensive care unit: a case-case-control study.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: To identify the risks and outcomes for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDRGNB) sepsis in neonates. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective case-case-control study between 1991 and 2016. The control group was selected from the same source records of all neonates with clinical or suspected sepsis but not culture-proven. RESULTS: The numbers of patients in the MDRGNB sepsis, non-MDRGNB sepsis, and control groups were 157, 88, and 218, respectively. MDRGNB sepsis was significantly associated with outborn infants [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.08; p = 0.003] and infants who had a neurologic sequela (aOR 11.58; p = 0.04), lower gestational age (p = 0.03) or previous aminoglycoside use (aOR 2.43; p < 0.001) compared with the control group. Non-MDRGNB sepsis was associated with outborn infants (aOR 2.63; p < 0.001), and infants who had neurologic sequelae (aOR 48.25; p = 0.001) and previous cephalosporin use (aOR 6.28; p < 0.001) or cefoperazone plus sulbactam use (aOR 6.48; p = 0.02) compared with the control group. Case fatality (OR 3.63; p < 0.001) and septic shock (OR 12.81; p < 0.001) rates, length of stay (p < 0.001), and daily hospital costs (p = 0.01) were higher in the MDRGNB sepsis group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Smaller preterm neonate with previous aminoglycoside use had a higher MDRGNB than non-MDRGNB sepsis compared with the control group. Intervention to reduce MDRGNB sepsis in the NICU is cost-effective."
15724650,[Early results of surgical treatment in acquired heart diseases during endocarditis in own material].,2004,"BACKGROUND: Endocarditis can concern natural as well as artificial heart valves. In conservative treatment mortality reaches 24-60%. Surgical procedure is the only way to save these patients in most cases. METHODS: Between 1998-2001, 114 patients underwent surgery because of valve endocarditis, 86 male and 28 female. 43 patients underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR), (13 MV reoperation), 51 aortic valve replacement (AVR), (16 AV reoperation) and 20 patients underwent MVR and AVR (3 both valves replacement). Three groups were similar regarding age, gender, emergency or elective procedures and NYHA class four. All patients underwent open heart surgery in ECC with hypothermia and crystalloid cardioplegia done by the same group of surgeons. RESULTS: Operative mortality in the MVR group was 11.6% (five of 43) compared to 3.9% (two of 51) AVR patients and 25% (five of 20) MVR and AVR group. The highest mortality rate was in both infected artificial valves procedures. There was growth of the bacteria in intraoperative material in 37.6% (33) of cases, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Incidence of postoperative sepsis, multiorgan failure, high grade atrio-ventricular block or low cardiac output was the highest in MVR and AVR patients. Independent predictors of operative mortality included increasing patient age, female gender, infected valve reoperation, and history of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with endocarditis and compromised hemodynamic status can be operated with acceptable morbidity and mortality. If echocardiography shows the cuspids perforations or vegetations, chords tendinous rupture or perivalvular leak, the patients should undergo cardiac surgery as soon as possible, in order to avoid severe embolic complications."
32166270,Predicted Economic Benefits of a Novel Biomarker for Earlier Sepsis Identification and Treatment: A Counterfactual Analysis.,2019,"To estimate the potential clinical and health economic value of earlier sepsis identification in the emergency department using a novel diagnostic marker, monocyte distribution width. DESIGN: The analysis was conducted in two phases: 1) an analysis of the pivotal registration trial evidence to estimate the potential benefit of monocyte distribution width for early sepsis identification and (2) a cost-consequence analysis to estimate the potential economic and clinical benefits that could have resulted from earlier administration of antibiotics for those patients. SETTING: Sepsis identified in the emergency department which led to inpatient hospitalizations. PATIENTS: Adult sepsis patients admitted through the emergency department. INTERVENTIONS: None. This was a model simulation of clinical and economic outcomes of monocyte distribution width based on results from a noninterventional, multicenter clinical trial. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 385 patients with sepsis, a total of 349 were eligible for inclusion. Sixty-seven percent of patients were predicted to benefit from monocyte distribution width results, resulting in an estimated mean reduction in time to antibiotics administration from 3.98 hours using standard of care to 2.07 hours using monocyte distribution width + standard of care. Based on this simulated reduction in time to antibiotics, monocyte distribution width + standard of care could have resulted in a less than or equal to 14.2% reduction (27.9% vs 32.5%) in mortality, a mean reduction of 1.48 days (10.0 vs 11.5 d) in length of stay, and $3,460 ($23,466 vs $26,926) savings per hospitalization. At the hospital level, based on an established national mean of 206 sepsis hospitalizations per hospital per year, earlier identification with monocyte distribution width is predicted to result in a total of $712,783 in annual cost savings per hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Improved early identification of sepsis using monocyte distribution width along with current standard of care is estimated to improve both clinical and economic outcomes of sepsis patients presenting in the emergency department. Further research is warranted to confirm these model projections."
15597348,Potential role for platelet apheresis for post-liver transplant thrombocytosis complicating portal vein thrombosis.,2004,"Except for patients with underlying myeloproliferative diseases (MPD), thrombocytosis is rarely encountered in cirrhotic patients after liver transplantation. Although the long-term control of primary thrombocytosis is important for the prevention of graft thrombosis in MPD patients, the threshold for intervention and best mode for the control of persistent reactive thrombocytosis after liver transplantation is unclear. We present two patients with extreme reactive thrombocytosis (over 1,000 x 10(9)/l) due to intra-abdominal sepsis after liver transplantation. Furthermore, both patients suffered from bleeding problems as well as ongoing venous thrombosis of the graft. Rapid control of the platelet count was achieved using platelet apheresis. The use of cell separation procedures may be a relatively rapid, reversible, and reasonably safe way to control platelet counts peri-operatively in liver transplant recipients."
31950802,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence estimation in the adult general population in Belgium : a meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Although multiple HCV prevalence studies were recently performed in the general population from Belgium, they suffer from a lack of geographical representativeness, an insufficient number of participants or a lack of inclusion of high prevalence groups. The aim of this study is to provide robust information on the HCV burden. METHODS: Recently performed HCV prevalence studies in the general, adult population were included in this study, based on well-defined selection criteria. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the seroprevalence, the prevalence of participants with viremia and the prevalence estimation for people with viremia which were unaware of their status. RESULTS: Eight studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion of the quantitative prevalence estimation. Based on the meta-analysis on these 8 studies, we estimated an HCV seroprevalence of 1.01% [95% CI : 0.66-1.42%], representing a total of 90,722 adult, HCV seropositives of which 64,412 individuals (0.71%) were confirmed seropositive. Based on the RNA presence, an estimated viremic prevalence of 0.33% [95% CI : 0.21-0.47 %] was determined, corresponding with 29,642 individuals. This is 46,0% of the true HCV seropositive residents. Further, based on the availability of patient information in 5 out of the 8 studies, a prevalence of 0.18% [95% CI : 0.07-0.33] representing 16,168 individuals from the adult Belgian population are unaware of their HCV status. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the quantitative measurement by the meta-analysis will be more reliable for their use in the design of a screening strategy or in the development of prevention campaigns as compared to the prevalence estimations performed at local level."
31812456,Diagnostic test accuracy of the cobas 6800 system for detection of hepatitis c virus viraemia levels from dried blood spots.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Because hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is curable in the majority of cases, the diagnosis of all infected patients has become a priority. In difficult-to-diagnose populations, simpler diagnostic methods are required such as the use of dried blood spots (DBS) as an alternative to blood drawn by venipuncture (VP). Before being able to include it as a HCV diagnostic detection method within the Spanish National Health System, the diagnostic accuracy of standard hospital equipment must be evaluated. METHODOLOGY: DBS samples were evaluated in vitro and in a field test after being processed in the Cobas 6800 system, establishing a correlation with the result by VP. Performance with different viral loads and intra-assay variability was compared. RESULTS: In samples with a viral load of>3 log(10)IU/ml, viraemia was detected in all cases when at least two blood spot elutions were used (94 detections out of 95 spot elutions). The performance with 2 spots was lower in samples with<3 log(10)IU/ml (7/20). Correlation between VP and DBS viraemia was excellent (maximum with 2 spots, r(2)=0.906, P<.001) with a coefficient of variation of 0.05%. In routine clinical practice with specimens from screened subjects (n=61), excellent diagnostic accuracy was also observed. CONCLUSION: Viral load detection using DBS of at least two spots is a reliable method for HCV diagnosis. The standardisation of the method is feasible and our results support the incorporation of this diagnostic tool in Spain's Public Health System."
20045261,Time course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with burns--prognostic value of interleukin-10.,2010,"INTRODUCTION: Trends and the prognostic value of cytokine responses to severe burns have not been fully examined in humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the time course and prognostic value of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the immediate post-burn period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were taken for measuring IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha concentrations from patients with more than 20% burned surface area on admission and on 5 consecutive days. Development of sepsis was assessed using standard criteria twice a day. RESULTS: IL-12p70 remained under assay detection levels in the study period. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha could be detected in stimulated blood samples with higher levels in survivors (n=21). IL-6 on days 4-5 and IL-8 on days 4-6 in non-stimulated plasma showed significant elevation in non-survivors (n=18) whereas in stimulated blood its levels did not differ significantly. IL-10 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors during the study period in non-stimulated, and except day 6 in stimulated blood. Using the cut-off level of 14 pg ml(-1) for IL-10 predicted ICU mortality with 85.4% sensitivity and 84.2% specificity on admission. CONCLUSION: Early anti-inflammatory excess had a bad prognosis for patients suffering from severe burns."
31809776,Twelve year analysis of aerobic-only blood cultures for routine detection of bacteraemia.,2020,"Sampling practices determine the accuracy of blood culture in diagnosing bloodstream infection. The main acute hospital in this study introduced aerobic-only routine blood cultures aiming to increase the volume and number of aerobic samples. At the smaller acute site, aerobic-anaerobic pairs were sent routinely. Culture yield and sampling practices were compared at these two sites and it was found that anaerobic cultures increased the yield of pathogens including facultative anaerobes. Volume cultured and number of samples sent fell short of national recommendations. The aerobic-only policy did not result in more blood being cultured. Based on these findings, the main acute hospital is reintroducing aerobic-anaerobic pairs for routine culture."
19997683,An interesting case of autonomic dysreflexia.,2009,"Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is not an uncommon clinical condition and it is usually detected in patients with complete spinal injuries at or above thoracic 6th vertebral level (T 6). This condition is reported to occur in 48- 60% of cases of spinal cord injury at or above the level of T6. But AD due to injury below T6 is rare. The basic mechanism is thought to be due to excessive, uncontrolled activation of sympathetic system. In the present case, we discuss a persistent AD in 55-yr-old tetraplegic patient with C5 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade A lesion due to a fall from 10 metre height. MRI examination showed C5 and C6 bi-facets fracture and dislocation with canal compromise. Wiring and fusion was performed but recurrent mucous plugging and aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection happened during the hospital stay. Three months later, he was re-admitted with multiple pressure sores, pneumonia, sepsis and high blood pressure. He was administered with nifedepine but the blood pressure kept fluctuating. The present study highlights how the precipitating factors like concomitant urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcers, spasticity triggered the AD attack. The knowledge of the AD and its proper diagnosis and management may be beneficial to all clinicians and the present article attempts to highlight such."
32150465,Genetic Diversity of Listeria monocytogenes Isolates from Invasive Listeriosis in China.,2020,"Listeria monocytogenes is a deadly foodborne pathogen, and infections can result in meningoencephalitis and sepsis with mortality rates of up to 30%. In this study, we performed comparative whole-genome analysis of 30 clinical isolates sequenced together with 32 previously sequenced clinical and food isolates from China. The data indicate that L. monocytogenes isolates belonging to the clonal complexes (CC) -1, -8, -9, -87, -121, and -155 are present in human clinical cases. The majority of isolates are from CC-87, 9, and 8 and overlap with those CCs previously reported on the basis of multilocus sequence typing for isolates from Chinese food products. Detailed genome analysis of isolates, representative of CCs in clinical and food products, revealed strong similarities both in their core- and accessory genomes indicating that they are highly related. When compared to genome sequences of isolates of a given CC worldwide, clinical isolates of China were distinct and clustered in unified clades. Our data indicate that epidemic clones of L. monocytogenes (CC-87, 9, and 8) with unusually high occurrence of plasmids are unique to China and suggest that common populations of L. monocytogenes clones are present in both clinical and food products in China."
15600273,Clinical Hepatozoon canis infection in a dog in Turkey.,2004,"A five-year-old female dog was presented with a four-week history of inappetence, weight loss, and skin and gait abnormalities. Physical examination revealed weakness, depression, incoordination of the posterior limbs, emaciation, skin and hair coat alterations, peripheral lymphadenopathy, pale mucous membranes and fever. Laboratory analysis of samples revealed abnormalities which included anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low serum glucose and albumin concentrations, and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity. The diagnosis was confirmed microscopically, by demonstrating the presence of Hepatozoon canis gametocytes within neutrophils in Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. Treatment consisting of toltrazuril and a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination was effective in relieving the clinical signs and clearing the blood of H. canis gametocytes. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first detailed clinical description of H. canis infection in a dog in Turkey."
20164028,Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and alveolar epithelium apoptosis: an histopathological and immunohistochemical study.,2009,"Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome results from a variety of different initial insults, including trauma, sepsis, pneumonia and aspiration, and represents a severe form of acute lung injury. The lung samples of a 20-year-old man who had suffered a serious motorbike accident were obtained for histological examination. He died on the seventh day as a consequence of respiratory failure. The typical histopathological features of syndrome overlapping the first exudative phase into the second proliferate phase were observed. The apoptotic index of the early apoptotic phase evaluated using M30CytoDEATH was 3.4+/-0.2. The average number of apoptotic cells in the intermediate and late phases measured using the TUNEL method was 9.8+/-0.7. Our findings indicate that alveolar epithelium apoptosis seems to be less important during the early phases of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome."
25677258,"Serological surveillance for Penicillium marneffei infection in HIV-infected patients during 2004-2011 in Guangzhou, China.",2015,"Prevalence of disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection is not known in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for disseminated P. marneffei infection in HIV-infected patients during 2004-11 in Guangzhou, China. We tested 8131 archived HIV-infected patient serum samples for P. marneffei-specific mannoprotein (Mp1p) antigen using a highly sensitive and specific ELISA that we previously established. The CD4 count of 2686 cases was determined by flow cytometry. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of Mp1p antigenaemia. The overall prevalence of disseminated penicilliosis as detected by positive serum Mp1p antigen was 9.36% (761/8131), in good concordance with Platelia Aspergillus immunoassay. During 2004-11, the prevalence increased to a peak of 12.58% (158/1256) in 2010 and decreased in 2011. Penicilliosis was strongly associated with progression from HIV to AIDS (OR 4.66, 95% CI 3.94-5.51, p <0.001) and humidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p 0.002). Disseminated penicilliosis occurred mainly during the rainy seasons (p <0.001). For 2686 cases with known CD4 count, logistic regression showed that CD4 count of <200 cells/muL was a risk factor for penicilliosis (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.10-7.66, p 0.032), especially when it was <50 cells/muL (OR 24.26, 95% CI 10.63-55.36, p <0.001) during which 28.06% of patients developed disseminated penicilliosis. In conclusion, approximately 9.36% of the HIV-infected patients in our study developed disseminated penicilliosis. Rapid diagnosis may be achieved by performing serological surveillance for Mp1p antigenaemia as a routine procedure for all HIV-infected patients with CD4 count of <50 cells/muL."
15614156,Hepatocyte transplantation for inherited factor VII deficiency.,2004,"Hepatocyte transplantation has been investigated in patients with liver-based metabolic disorders and acute liver failure. We report the first use of hepatocyte transplantation in two brothers with severe inherited coagulation factor VII deficiency. Patient 1 received a total of 1.09x10(9) cryopreserved hepatocytes, and patient received 2.18x10(9) fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes through a Hickman line inserted in the inferior mesenteric vein. Infusion of isolated human hepatocytes improved the coagulation defect and markedly decreased the requirement for exogenous recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) to approximately 20% of that before cell transplantation. In both patients, episodes of line sepsis were associated with an increase in rFVIIa requirement. Six months posthepatocyte transplantation, higher rFVIIa doses were required, suggesting loss of transplanted hepatocyte function. Because of increasing problems with venous access and long-term uncertainty of the efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation, orthotopic liver transplantation was performed successfully in both cases."
26012149,[Infections during the first posttransplant year--experience at Sibenik General Hospital].,2014,"AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and type of infective complications in kidney recipients during the first year after transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on the diagnosis and treatment of infective complications in 36 patients transplanted from 2004 until September 2012 (22 men and 14 women), age at the time of transplantation 19-73 years. We recorded the incidence of urinary tract infections, clinical variants (asymptomatic bacteriuria, acute pyelonephritis, sepsis) and etiology, i.e. causes, pneumonia, viral infections and cytomegalovirus infections (CMV) (with special reference to the use or no use of prophylactic valganciclovir), polyoma virus infection, BKV, JC, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes zoster virus. RESULTS: The most common infective complication, uroinfection, was recorded in 69% of patients, of which 68% had one or more relapses. The most common clinical form of the infection was acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (of which 4 cases of ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pneumonia occurred in 4 transplant patients, one CMV pneumonia, other of bacterial origin. CMV infection and BKV occurred in 17% and herpes zoster infection in 11% of patients. One patient was diagnosed with EBV meningoencephalitis. One-year graft survival was 100% in patients without urinary tract infections in the first year after transplantation (31% of all patients) and 96% in patients with infections (69% of all patients).Three-year graft survival rate was 100% in patients without infection and 96% in patients with infections in the first year after transplantation. One- and three-year graft survival in patients with chronic hepatitis C was 100%. It was a small group of patients (5/36, 14%); the incidence of urinary tract infections amounted to 60%, and of CMV and BK virus to 20%. CONCLUSION: Infections are a common problem after kidney transplantation, which can be treated in a secondary care hospital."
41424977,Prognostic Models Using the Lactate-to-Albumin Ratio for 28-Day Mortality in ICU Sepsis Patients: A Bayesian Model Averaging Approach.,2025,"PURPOSE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has recently emerged as a significant predictor of 28-day mortality in sepsis. This study aims to determine the prognostic value of LAR for 28-day mortality and identify prognostic models for sepsis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Thong Nhat Hospital, Vietnam. The study included patients aged 16 years and older diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 consensus guidelines. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days from the time of sepsis diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was used to identify candidate models. Discrimination was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), and calibration was assessed. RESULTS: This study included 170 participants with a median age of 73 years and a male predominance (54.1%). The overall 28-day mortality rate was 57.6%. The median LAR was 2.2, with a statistically significant difference between the survival and mortality groups (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that LAR was independently associated with 28-day mortality (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.09-6.86; p = 0.017). The AUC for LAR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.87; p < 0.001) with a cut-off point of 1.2 (sensitivity 91%, specificity 57%). BMA identified three clinically applicable models: LAR combined with age and respiratory infection (AUC 0.855), LAR combined with respiratory infection (AUC 0.839), and LAR combined with age and respiratory infection and SOFA score (AUC 0.864). Internal validation also represented the stability and reproducibility of these models with AUC 0.848, 0.836, and 0.854, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this single-center cohort, higher LAR was independently associated with 28-day mortality, and BMA identified simple LAR-based models with good internal discrimination and calibration. These findings require further external validation before routine clinical implementation."
20078956,[Residue amniotic fluid volume after preterm premature rupture of membranes and maternal-fetal outcome.].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the residue amniotic fluid volume after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and maternal-fetal prognosis. METHODS: One hundred and forty-five pregnant women with PPROM during 28 - 34 gestational weeks were studied, hospitalized in department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from Jan. 2002 to Feb. 2009, and Chongqing Health Center For Women And Children from Jan. 2005 to Feb. 2009. All patients are willing to take part in these experiments. According to Amniotic fluid index (AFI) by ultrasound, patients were devided into three groups: (1) Group of oligohydramnios: AFI < 50 mm; (2) Group of borderline oligohydramnios: 50 mm </= AFI < 80 mm; (3) Group of normal amniotic fluid: 80 mm </= AFI < 180 mm. All the groups were similar with patient's age, gravidity and parity, white blood cell count (WBC), gestational age at rupture of membrane, rates of placental abruption, neonatal jaundice, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and neonatal respiratory failure (RF; P > 0.05). RESULTS: (1) Group of oligohydramnios had a shorter latent period (P < 0.05) compared with other two groups; (2) Group of oligohydramnios had a high rates of cesarean section (69%), Intra-amniotic infection (IAI, 36%), fetal distress (19%), neonatal asphyxia (28%), early-onset neonatal sepsis (28%) and hypoxic-ischemic myocardial injury (56%) than those in Group of normal amniotic fluid (39%, 9%, 3%, 8%, 9%, 13%; P < 0.01); (3) Logistic regression analysis showed that group of oligohydramnios was an independent risk factor of IAI and early-onset neonatal sepsis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oligohydramnios after pprom is associated with the shorter latent period, as well as the increasing risks of pregnancy complications of cesarean section, IAI, fetal distress, neonatal asphyxia, early-onset neonatal sepsis and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic myocardial injury. So, the amniotic fluid volume might be an important prognostic indicator to assess the outcomes of maternal and neonatal when PPROM happened."
25533491,Genome-wide association study of survival from sepsis due to pneumonia: an observational cohort study.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis continues to be a major cause of death, disability, and health-care expenditure worldwide. Despite evidence suggesting that host genetics can influence sepsis outcomes, no specific loci have yet been convincingly replicated. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that influence sepsis survival. METHODS: We did a genome-wide association study in three independent cohorts of white adult patients admitted to intensive care units with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock (as defined by the International Consensus Criteria) due to pneumonia or intra-abdominal infection (cohorts 1-3, n=2534 patients). The primary outcome was 28 day survival. Results for the cohort of patients with sepsis due to pneumonia were combined in a meta-analysis of 1553 patients from all three cohorts, of whom 359 died within 28 days of admission to the intensive-care unit. The most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a further 538 white patients with sepsis due to pneumonia (cohort 4), of whom 106 died. FINDINGS: In the genome-wide meta-analysis of three independent pneumonia cohorts (cohorts 1-3), common variants in the FER gene were strongly associated with survival (p=9.7 x 10(-8)). Further genotyping of the top associated SNP (rs4957796) in the additional cohort (cohort 4) resulted in a combined p value of 5.6 x 10(-8) (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.69). In a time-to-event analysis, each allele reduced the mortality over 28 days by 44% (hazard ratio for death 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.69; likelihood ratio test p=3.4 x 10(-9), after adjustment for age and stratification by cohort). Mortality was 9.5% in patients carrying the CC genotype, 15.2% in those carrying the TC genotype, and 25.3% in those carrying the TT genotype. No significant genetic associations were identified when patients with sepsis due to pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection were combined. INTERPRETATION: We have identified common variants in the FER gene that associate with a reduced risk of death from sepsis due to pneumonia. The FER gene and associated molecular pathways are potential novel targets for therapy or prevention and candidates for the development of biomarkers for risk stratification.

15603032,"Neonatal septicaemia in the neonatal care unit, Al-Anbar governorate, Iraq.",2002,"Neonatal septicaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. We studied 118 neonates admitted to the main referral hospital in Al-Anbar with positive blood cultures. The incidence of neonatal septicaemia for babies born at this hospital was 9.2 per 1000 live births, and mortality was 28%. Staphylococcus aureus (39%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30%) and Escherichia coli (21%) constituted 90% of all isolates. The isolates showed in vitro susceptibility to cefotaxime, chloramphenicol and gentamicin, but resistance to more commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin and cloxacillin. We recommend initial gentamicin/cefotaxime combined therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity test results. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the local epidemiology of neonatal septicaemia in formulating a rational antibiotics policy."
20169273,Accuracy of different methods for blood glucose measurement in critically ill patients.,2009,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Although glucometers have not been validated for intensive care units, they are regularly used. The aim of this study was to compare and assess the accuracy and clinical agreement of arterial glucose concentration obtained using colorimetry (Agluc-lab), capillary (Cgluc-strip) and arterial (Agluc-strip) glucose concentration obtained using glucometry and central venous glucose concentration obtained using colorimetry (Vgluc-lab). DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a university hospital. METHOD: Forty patients with septic shock and stable individuals without infection were included. The correlations between measurements were assessed both in the full sample and in subgroups using noradrenalin and presenting signs of tissue hypoperfusion. RESULTS: Cgluc-strip showed the poorest correlation (r = 0.8289) and agreement (-9.87 +/- 31.76). It exceeded the limits of acceptable variation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 23.7% of the cases, and was higher than Agluc-lab in 90% of the measurements. Agluc-strip showed the best correlation (r = 0.9406), with agreement of -6.75 +/- 19.07 and significant variation in 7.9%. For Vgluc-lab, r = 0.8549, with agreement of -4.20 +/- 28.37 and significant variation in 15.7%. Significant variation was more frequent in patients on noradrenalin (36.4% versus 6.3%; P = 0.03) but not in the subgroup with hypoperfusion. There was discordance regarding clinical management in 25%, 22% and 15% of the cases for Cgluc-strip, Vgluc-lab and Agluc-strip, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cgluc-strip should be avoided, particularly if noradrenalin is being used. This method usually overestimates the true glucose levels and gives rise to management errors.

31858869,Review of clinical practice guidelines on the use of procalcitonin in infections.,2020,"Background: Procalcitonin is a biomarker that can be used to diagnose bacterial infection and monitor treatment. Clinical practice guidelines are evidence-based recommendations by experts that aim to aid decision-making. In this systematic review, we searched for clinical practice guidelines and evaluated recommendations given regarding use of procalcitonin.Methods: Four biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database and Web of Science) and various national medical sites were searched for clinical practice guidelines. Guidelines that mentioned procalcitonin were included in the review.Results: Seventeen guidelines were included. The earliest were published in 2009 and the latest in 2018. A majority (12/17) recommended use of procalcitonin or stated that it can be useful. One national guideline did not recommend procalcitonin, stating that there is no need for any biomarkers in diagnostics of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Four guidelines stated no evidence to recommend or not recommend procalcitonin use. Thirteen of the guidelines commented on other concomitant or alternate biomarkers, mainly C-reactive protein. Five guidelines suggested decision limits for procalcitonin. None took a stand on how often procalcitonin should be analysed, and if it should be used as a single or as multiple measurements.Conclusions: One international and 11 national clinical practice guidelines endorse the use of procalcitonin in differential diagnosis of bacterial infections and/or to monitor antibiotic therapy. However, the evidence for or against the use of procalcitonin is weak."
19939407,In utero iron status and auditory neural maturation in premature infants as evaluated by auditory brainstem response.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cord ferritin (CF) concentration, an index of in utero iron status, is associated with auditory neural maturation in premature infants. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed to compare auditory neural maturation in infants with latent iron deficiency (CF 11-75 ng/mL) and infants with normal iron status (CF > 75 ng/mL) at birth. Our inclusion criteria were infants of 27-33 weeks gestational age who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between July 2007 and November 2008 within 12 hours after birth and had cord blood collected. Infants with TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, other infections, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, and herpes simplex), chromosomal disorders, craniofacial anomalies, culture-proven sepsis, and/or unstable conditions were excluded. CF level was measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay method. Bilateral monaural auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) was assessed using 80-dB nHL click stimuli at a repetition rate of 29.9/seconds within 48 hours after birth. RESULTS: Of the 80 infants studied, 35 had latent iron deficiency. After controlling for confounders, the infants with latent iron deficiency had significantly prolonged absolute wave latencies I, III, and V and decreased frequency of mature ABR waveforms compared with the infants with normal iron status. CONCLUSION: Premature infants with in utero latent iron deficiency have abnormal auditory neural maturation compared with infants with normal in utero iron status."
26139965,Serum Lysozyme (Muramidase) Levels in Intra-Abdominal Abscesses: An Experimental Study.,2015,"The role of serum lysozyme in the presence of intra-abdominal sepsis was studied to act as an adjunct to various other modalities used for diagnosing intra-abdominal abscesses. Lysozyme (muramidase) is a bacteriolytic enzyme located within phagocytic cells including leukocytes. We measured serum concentrations of lysozyme by a standard turbidimetric method on three groups of murine models. One group underwent caecal ligation and puncture (CLP), the second group underwent a sham operation, and the third group was used as controls. In mice with intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to caecal ligation and perforation (n = 30), the serum lysozyme levels were increased compared to the sham-operated mice (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) (p = <0.001). In this study, serum lysozyme levels have a high sensitivity and specificity related to the presence of an intra-abdominal abscess in mice. Clinical studies are required to demonstrate its role in humans."
20031270,Contamination of intravenous fluids: a continuing cause of hospital bacteremia.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bacteremia caused by the contamination of intravenous (IV) infusates is considered rare. Unfortunately, this problem has been underestimated because its identification requires culturing infusates, a procedure not performed routinely. METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital where IV infusates are admixed in nursing areas. The aim was to determine the prevalence of infusate contamination in adult patients with gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. Over a period of 32 months, a specimen of infusate was drawn for culture from each patient recruited after the laboratory reported a GNR in the blood. RESULTS: A total of 384 infusates were cultured from 384 patients who had been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia. Seven infusates grew a GNR in culture, for a contamination rate of 2% (7/384; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1% to 3%). In all cases, the infectious organism was the same as the organism isolated from the blood. Infusate contamination was responsible for 7% (7/108; 95% CI = 2% to 11%) of all primary bloodstream infections and 11% (7/62; 95% CI = 2% to 22%) of all primary bloodstream infections not associated with central venous catheter infection. CONCLUSIONS: For patients in hospitals where IV drugs are admixed in nursing units, we recommend instituting infusate culture as routine practice following the diagnosis of a GNR in the blood."
25672357,Lactococcus lactis Catherter-Related Bloodstream Infection in an Infant: Case Report.,2015,"Lactococcus lactis is a gram-positive coccus that is nonpathogenic in humans. Herein, we present the case of a 1-year-old boy with Down syndrome and Hirschprung's disease (HD) who developed a catheter-related bloodstream infection with L. lactis after gastrointestinal surgery. The patient had been hospitalized in the pediatric surgery unit from birth because of HD, and had undergone the Duhamel-Martin procedure which caused recurrent diarrhea episodes and feeding intolerance. On the infant's 430th day of life, he had an episode of gastroenteritis and feeding intolerance. Because of clinical suspiction of sepsis, blood cultures were taken both from the central venous catheter and peripheral vein, and evidence of a growing microorganism was detected in 2 different central venous catheter blood cultures taken 2 days apart. The colonies were then identified by both the Vitek 2 and Vitek MS systems (bioMerieux, Marseille, France) as L. lactis spp. lactis. The central venous catheter could not be removed because of the absence of a peripheral venous line, and the patient was subsequently successfully treated with vancomycin. Therefore, although Lactococcus species is generally thought to be nonpathogenic, it should still be kept in mind as a potential pathogen in infants."
41625152,Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV coinfection in severe adult meningoencephalitis: a rare diagnosis in a diabetic patient.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes is extremely rare in adults. We report a case of Streptococcus pyogenes combined with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was diagnosed by targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). The findings were subsequently confirmed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), respectively. Meanwhile, digital PCR (dPCR) detection indicated the presence of Streptococcus species DNA in the blood. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the possibility of meningitis. The patient's condition improved significantly following combined antibacterial and antiviral therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old female patient with a history of diabetes mellitus for over ten years presented with fever, vomiting, and impaired consciousness. CSF analysis showed significantly elevated cell count, elevated neutrophil percentage, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The tNGS result of CSF indicated Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV coinfection, meanwhile, dPCR of peripheral blood suggested the presence of Streptococcus species. The patient was therefore diagnosed with intracranial infection, sepsis, and septic shock. The antimicrobial therapy was promptly adjusted to include combined antibacterial and antiviral treatment. Following intervention, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. Subsequent CSF analysis and tNGS testing demonstrated normalization of cell count and LDH levels, a significant decrease in the detection level of Streptococcus pyogenes, and negative detection of EBV. CONCLUSION: Intracranial coinfection involving Streptococcus pyogenes and EBV is exceptionally rare in adults. Early clinical manifestations are often nonspecific, yet the disease can progress rapidly, underscoring the critical importance of prompt and accurate pathogen identification. The widespread application of tNGS has significantly enhanced early diagnostic capabilities in cases of intracranial infection."
41472308,Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Effects of 7-Deaza-2-methyladenosine (7DMA) in a Susceptible Mouse Model of Usutu Virus Infection.,2025,"Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging arbovirus recently associated with outbreaks in Western Europe. Although USUV is typically associated with asymptomatic or nonspecific febrile disease, the occurrence of severe neuroinvasive forms of disease has raised concern. There is currently no antiviral treatment available for USUV infection; therefore, we sought to investigate the protective effects of the nucleoside analogue 7DMA against USUV. Adding to 7DMA's activity against USUV in vitro reported by us and others, we found that 7DMA inhibits USUV replication at multiple stages in mammalian cell lines Vero CCL81 and SH-SY5Y. In vivo testing of 7DMA using the susceptible IFNAR(-/-) mouse model indicated that 7DMA treatment significantly reduced USUV viremia and viral load in tissues and prolonged mice survival. The characterization of the protective effects of 7DMA indicated that treatment also altered immunological aspects of disease development, further increasing the expression of mediators such as CXCL10, IL-15, and IFN-gamma, and increasing neutrophil recruitment to target organs. We did not observe significant tissue damage or pathology in USUV-infected mouse brains, suggesting that systemic infection and disease are the major components leading to mortality in this model. We conclude that 7DMA exerts protective effects against USUV infection in the IFNAR(-/-) model."
20052340,"Clinical features, risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia due to enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance: comparison with bacteremia due to enterococci without high-level gentamicin resistance.",2010,"High-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in enterococci has increased since the 1980s, but the clinical significance of the resistance and its impact on outcome have not been established. One hundred and thirty-six patients with bacteremia caused by enterococci with HLGR (HLGR group) were compared with 79 patients with bacteremia caused by enterococci without HLGR (non-HLGR group). Hematologic malignancy, neutropenia, Enterococcus faecium infection, nosocomial infection and monomicrobial bacteremia were more common in the HLGR group than the non-HLGR group, and APACHE II scores were also higher (P<0.05, in each case). Neutropenia, monomicrobial infection, stay in intensive care at culture, and use of 3rd generation cephalosporin, were independent risk factors for acquisition of HLGR enterococcal bacteremia. Fourteen-day and 30-day mortalities were higher in the HLGR group than the non-HLGR group in univariate analysis (37% vs. 15%, P=0.001; 50% vs. 22%, P<0.001). However, HLGR was not an independent risk factor for mortality due to enterococcal bacteremia in multivariate analysis. Therefore, HLGR enterococcal bacteremia is associated with more severe comorbid conditions and higher mortality than non-HLGR enterococcal bacteremia but the HLGR itself does not contribute significantly to mortality."
31863280,Using bioimpedance analysis to assess intensive care unit patients with sepsis in the post-resuscitation period: a prospective multicentre observational study.,2020,"PURPOSE: Clinicians lack well-validated, non-invasive, objective tools to guide volume management in the post-resuscitative period. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) represents a novel method for guiding fluid management. We studied the relationship of BIA vector length (VL), an indicator of volume status, to the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with sepsis. METHODS: This is a multicentre prospective observational study at four Canadian ICUs. We examined adult patients admitted to the ICU within 72 hr of a sepsis diagnosis. Patients underwent daily BIA measurements for 30 days, until discharge from the ICU, or until death. Our primary outcome was the ongoing need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and we examined the association with VL using a generalized estimating equation. Our secondary analyses were targeted to determine an association between VL and other measures of volume status and acute kidney injury (AKI). RESULTS: We enrolled 159 patients from four centres over 27 months. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 64 (15) yr with a mean (SD) APACHE (acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation) II score of 25 (10); 57% (n = 91) were male. A 50-unit (ohm.m) increase in VL over any time period was associated with a 30% decrease in the probability of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (P < 0.03). Volume expansion, indicated by a shorter VL, correlated with higher edema scores (r = - 0.31; P < 0.001) and higher net 24-hr fluid balance (r = - 0.27, P < 0.001). Patients with AKI had a shorter overall VL (r = - 0.23; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in VL over time is associated with a decrease in probability of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Vector length correlates with other commonly used volume assessment methods in post-resuscitation patients with sepsis."
25783306,Clinical management of infantile cholelithiasis.,2015,"PURPOSE: Infantile cholelithiasis is a rare disease process, and management strategies are poorly defined. We therefore examined the risk factors, complications, and management of this disease at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed infants with cholelithiasis diagnosed on ultrasound between 1997 and 2013. Details of the patient's medical history, presentation, imaging findings, laboratory values, and treatment were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Over the 16-year period, 50 infants were evaluated for cholelithiasis. Thirty-seven (74%) had at least one risk factor for gallstone development which included total parenteral nutrition, diuretic therapy, cephalosporin antibiotic treatment, sepsis, congenital heart disease (CHD), prematurity, or a malabsorptive gastrointestinal condition. Thirteen (26%) infants were symptomatic, most commonly presenting with emesis and jaundice. Complications from gallstones included choledocholithiasis (9), cholecystitis (3), and pancreatitis (1). Nearly half (6/13) of patients with complicated cholelithiasis had CHD. Of infants presenting with complications, 9 had a cholecystectomy, most commonly via a laparoscopic approach, 2 had an ERCP for choledocholithiasis, and 2 were medically managed. In patients managed conservatively, resolution of gallstones occurred in 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Infantile cholelithiasis has variable outcomes ranging from spontaneous resolution to choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis. While patients with complicated cholelithiasis often undergo an operation, infants <1year of age have higher anesthetic and surgical risks. Conservative management with ERCP or medical treatment can also be successful, which offers an alternative to operative intervention in properly selected patients."
41407454,[Advancing the development of hematology care units to enhance hematology‑specific critical care capacity].,2025,"Establishing hematology care units (HCU) is essential for strengthening hematology-specific critical care capacity. This article outlines two HCU operational models in China-the ICU model and the pre-ICU model-and discusses practical insights from their implementation. It recommends establishing HCU within hematology wards, equipped for respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring and blood purification, and led by hematologists trained in critical care or by teams collaborating efficiently with general ICU through standardized workflows. For units not yet meeting these standards, establishing a resuscitation room and strengthening critical care training are advised. HCU primarily admit patients with severe or life-threatening bleeding due to hematologic diseases, severe infections or septic shock, early complications of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML/APL), treatment-related complications, rapidly progressive or highly lethal conditions, and those requiring organ support or blood purification. Emphasis is placed on quantitative assessment of disease severity and timely transfer to the HCU, using tools such as the National Early Warning Score, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), SOFA/DeltaSOFA, and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer risk index for patient stratification. Early implementation of sepsis bundles is emphasized. For organ support, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is prioritized to improve oxygenation. Continuous renal replacement therapy is performed when there are indications such as renal failure with oliguria or anuria, congestive heart failure, or drug overdose, etc. Treatment of the underlying hematologic disease follows a ""three-tier stratification"" and ""watch-and-adjust"" strategy, while respecting patient preferences. We encourage eligible hematology centers to actively establish HCU, explore new care models, and strengthen hematology-specific critical care capacity."
15598014,[Morphological and ultrastructural changes in the rat kidney after experimental sepsis].,2004,"Experimental sepsis was investigated in 42 male white Wistar rats. The animals were divided into 7 equal groups. Suspended E. coli cells (2 x 10(7) per 100 g body weight) were injected into the tail vein in groups I-VI, group VII served as a control group. The rats were sacrificed with cervical dislocation at different times after injection: in 45 min (group I), 2 h (group II), 6 h (group III), 24 h (group IV), 48 h (group V), and 120 h (group VI). Samples of kidneys were taken and embedded in paraffin and EPON-812 for histological and electron microscopical evaluation, respectively. RESULTS: histological examination demonstrated that changes in kindeys started in 2 h after infection to achieve the maximum level in 24 h, showing thereafter a tendency to decrease. A significant tissue damage was first seen in the loop and distal tubules of nephrons, and then expanded to the proximal tubules. Electron microscope examination demonstrated that changes in podocytes and cytopodia could be distinctly differentiated in 2 h after infection and obviously increased in the course of the experiment. The podocytes were enlarged, the processes were expanded and adhered to each other. For that reason the number of filtration pores in the glomerular basal membrane decreased. The count of mesangial cells in the glomerulus was increased."
20012238,Case report: perioperative use of protein c concentrate for protein C deficiency in THA.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative management of patients with heterozygous protein C deficiency is challenging because of the competing risks of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 74-year-old man with protein C deficiency and heterozygous prothrombin G20210A gene mutation who had a successful left THA with perioperative administration of human zymogen protein C concentrate in addition to anticoagulation with enoxaparin. LITERATURE REVIEW: Several studies have reported the use of protein C concentrate in severe sepsis-associated purpura fulminans in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency who have had thrombotic events. We reviewed studies and case reports pertinent to the treatment of patients with protein C deficiency, especially in the perioperative setting. We report the case of a patient undergoing THA in whom we used human zymogen protein C concentrate. PURPOSES AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: THA, a particularly high-risk procedure, is associated with a 40% to 70% incidence of venographic deep venous thrombosis and a 2% to 3% incidence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis. These risks are greater in people with thrombophilic defects such as protein C deficiency. The use of human zymogen protein C in our patient with heterozygous protein C deficiency during the perioperative period of a THA was associated with no evidence of excessive bleeding, hematoma, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism."
31882425,Long-term Experience with Rapid Screening for Platelet Bacterial Contamination in a High-volume Transfusion Service.,2019,"Bacterial sepsis after platelet transfusion is a major cause of transfusion-transmitted infections in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends performing quality control for platelet bacterial detection on days 4 and 5 before platelet transfusion. We assessed the feasibility of implementing the Pan Genera Detection (PGD) test, an FDA-approved immunoassay for platelet bacterial detection, for the primary and secondary bacterial screening of platelet units in a high-volume setting. Records were reviewed from January 2010 through December 2015. All apheresis platelets underwent primary screening by using culture methods. Additional screening with the PGD test was performed daily until February 2013, when PGD testing of apheresis platelets was performed at the start of storage day 5. In April 2015, PGD testing of apheresis platelet products was performed at the start of storage day 4. Post-storage pooled whole blood-derived platelets were screened by using the PGD test on the day of use. During the 6-year study period, 16,839 PGD tests were performed. If the PGD test was reactive, repeat PGD testing was performed. In cases of repeat reactivity, units were quarantined and cultured. Initially, 42 (0.25%) tests were reactive; 26/42 (61.91%) were repeatedly reactive and resulted in an overall PGD repeat reactivity rate of 0.15%. Only one sample grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus No transfusion-transmitted infections were reported. The PGD bacterial detection assay was feasible and efficient in our high-volume transfusion service."
25520829,A case of purpura fulminans caused by Hemophilus influenzae complicated by reversible cardiomyopathy.,2014,"Here, we report a case of a 41-year-old male diagnosed as septic shock with purpura fulminans (PF) infection. The causative organism was beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Hemophilus influenzae. He developed fulminant cardiac dysfunction approximately 1 h after admission, and the cause was considered to be septic cardiomyopathy. Blood pressure and oxygenation were maintained at adequate levels with the aid of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The cardiac dysfunction was reversible, and he was successfully weaned from ECMO on day 12 of hospitalization. However, he needed amputation for all extremities because the infection spread to his limbs and eventually, succumbed to sepsis caused by empyema on day 34 of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second case of PF caused by H. influenzae in an adult to be reported worldwide."
41419730,"MIDAS: rapid, multiplexed molecular profiling for integrated host-pathogen analysis.",2025,"Addressing the need for integrated molecular analysis in complex infectious conditions requires technologies that rapidly quantify both pathogens and host responses. This is particularly relevant in sepsis research, where existing tools typically measure either microbial or host biomarkers. Here, we present MIDAS (Multiplexed Intelligent Diffraction Analysis System), a proof-of-concept platform that integrates shape-encoded hydrogel particles with lens-free diffraction imaging and deep learning-based analysis to enable simultaneous quantification of bacterial RNA and inflammatory proteins in a single system optimized for potential point-of-care use. The assay completes multiplexed measurements in under 4 h, significantly faster than standard culture workflows ( ~ 20-40 h). Beyond spiked studies, MIDAS is evaluated using specimens from a clinically relevant porcine sepsis model, showing high concordance with culture, qPCR and ELISA. Although further clinical validation is required, this flexible platform may support the development of accessible host-pathogen profiling tools with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, and beyond."
31806570,Cannabinoid receptor 2 promotes the intracellular degradation of HMGB1 via the autophagy-lysosome pathway in macrophage.,2020,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a late phase inflammatory mediator in many inflammatory diseases. Extracellular HMGB1 could bind to many membrane receptors to activate downstream signaling molecules and promote inflammation resulting in cell and tissue damage. In our previous work, we found cannabinoid receptor Ⅱ(CB2R) inhibited the expression of HMGB1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic models in vivo and in vitro, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The present study was aimed to explore the possible pathway through which CB2R suppressed HMGB1. Here, we found that the specific agonist of CB2R, GW405833 (GW) could induce intracellular HMGB1 degradation without influencing HMGB1 mRNA in peritoneal macrophages. Then we observed that autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) but not proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (MG) could block GW-induced HMGB1 degradation, which indicated that the autophagy-lysosome but not the ubiquitination pathway was involved in this process. Further study showed that GW could promote the integrity of autophagy flux in macrophages in terms of increased level of LC3Ⅱand decreased expression of p62 protein. It also observed that inhibition of autophagy blocked GW-induced nuclear translocation of HMGB1 in macrophages. GW could up-regulate expression of Cathepsin B (CTSB), and inhibition of CTSB blocked GW-induced HMGB1 degradation. In summary, all the data showed that activation of CB2R could promote the intracellular degradation of HMGB1 via the autophagy-lysosome pathway in macrophage."
15616386,The relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome revisited: which patients will benefit from low-dose steroids?,2004,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several clinical studies have given rise to optimism about low-dose steroid treatment in patients with sepsis. It reduces time to shock reversal and may even have a positive effect on mortality. The pathophysiology of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome has not yet been determined, and the usefulness of basal and stimulated cortisol levels in diagnosing this syndrome is still uncertain. This review will examine recent evidence to elucidate these questions. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies performed in more than 1000 patients in intensive care show convincingly that in general serum cortisol levels are increased. Basal or stimulated cortisol levels are at best useful to predict mortality in patients in intensive care, not to decide which patients to treat or when to discontinue treatment. Measuring free cortisol concentrations rather than total cortisol concentrations in critically ill patients may lead to new research strategies to identify the mode of action of low-dose steroid treatment. SUMMARY: It has been shown that low-dose corticosteroid administration to catecholamine-dependent patients in septic shock results in shock reversal. There seems to be a relative shortage of cortisol, because low-dose hydrocortisone administration resulting in cortisol levels as much as four times the already increased levels results in shock reversal. Strong evidence for a positive effect on mortality is still lacking, perhaps because of the relatively low number of patients investigated. A very important topic in interpreting studies is that total (free plus protein-bound) cortisol has been measured. Future studies should also measure free cortisol concentrations, which could add to our knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome. On the basis of current knowledge, there is no evidence to support a treatment strategy based on a random or stimulated cortisol level. At the moment, rapid hemodynamic improvement of catecholamine-dependent patients after the administration of low-dose corticosteroids still seems the best available clue to diagnosis."
31946109,In vitro quantification of lactate in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) samples.,2019,"Continuous measurement of lactate levels in the blood is a prerequisite in intensive care patients who are susceptible to sepsis due to their suppressed immune system and increased metabolic demand. Currently, there exists no noninvasive tool for continuous measurement of lactate in clinical practice. The current mode of measurement is based on arterial blood gas analyzers which require sampling of arterial blood. In this work, we propose the use of Near Infra-Red (NIR) spectroscopy together with multivariate models as a means to non-invasively predict the concentration of lactate in the blood. As the first step towards this objective, we examined the possibility of accurately predicting concentrations of sodium lactate (NaLac) from the NIR spectra of 37 isotonic phosphate buffer saline (PBS) samples containing NaLac ranging from 0 to 20 mmol/L. NIR spectra of PBS samples were collected using the Lambda 1050 dual beam spectrometer over a spectral range of 800 - 2600 nm with a quartz cell of 1 mm optical path. Estimates and calibration of the lactate concentration with the NIR spectra were made using Partial Least-Squares (PLS) regression analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation on filtered spectra. The regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0.977 and a standard error of 0.89 mmol/L between the predicted and prepared samples. The results suggest that NIR spectroscopy together with multivariate models can be a valuable tool for non-invasive assessment of blood lactate concentrations."
41493324,SBP: Always peritonitis in decompensated cirrhosis? Case report and review of the literature.,2025,"We report a case of a 56-year-old male with alcohol-associated liver cirrhosis presenting with septic and obstructive shock due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and pericarditis with tamponade. Imaging revealed ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion requiring drainage. Escherichia coli with identical resistance patterns was cultured from all drained fluids. Scintigraphy confirmed a peritoneal-pericardial connection. After initial treatment, fluid recurrences prompted evaluation for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, which was unfortunately complicated by severe bleeding, ultimately leading to multi-organ failure and death. This case highlights the exceptional occurrence of pericardial effusion and spontaneous bacterial pericarditis as well as peritonitis as a complication of decompensated cirrhosis, with confirmed connection between the pericardium and the abdominal cavity by nuclear tracer study, as well as microbiological evidence. Based on an overview of all published cases management includes diuretics, paracentesis and in refractory cases, TIPS. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment."
41488071,The association between coagulation function and prognosis in patients with sepsis: a meta-analysis of predictive performance introduction.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units, is associated with coagulation dysfunction, a key pathological feature linked to multi-organ failure. However, the prognostic value of coagulation markers remains heterogeneous across studies. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients, focusing on their predictive performance. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, nine studies (n = 1954) were included from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The associations of coagulation markers (APTT, PT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, INR) and SOFA scores with the outcome were quantified using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Diagnostic accuracy was summarized by the area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic, and a random-effects model was employed to account for between-study variation. The robustness of the findings was evaluated through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Fibrinogen showed a significant inverse correlation with mortality [OR = 0.76, 95% CI (0.59-0.97)], while INR demonstrated moderate predictive ability (AUC = 0.68). APTT and PT had non-significant ORs but moderate AUCs (0.75 and 0.75, respectively). D-dimer and SOFA score ORs were non-significant, though SOFA's AUC indicated good prognostic utility. High heterogeneity (I (2) > 74%) and sensitivity to individual studies were noted. CONCLUSION: Specific coagulation markers, notably fibrinogen and INR, may aid in sepsis prognosis assessment, but variability across studies limits generalizability. Further high-quality studies are warranted to validate these findings. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251049209, identifier CRD420251049209."
15726835,Pentastarch in a balanced solution reduces hepatic leukocyte recruitment in early sepsis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the hepatic leukocyte endothelial cell interactions occurring in early sepsis and to determine whether this is influenced by fluid treatment. METHODS: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation in C57Bl/6 mice. One of 6 iv fluid regimes was given immediately postsurgery and at 6 h. The hepatic microcirculation was examined by intravital microscopy at 6 h. RESULTS: All 0.9% saline-based solutions were associated with an increase in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions as demonstrated by an increase in the rolling flux in the sham and naive mice. In the septic mice treated with normal saline, there was a 20-fold increase in leukocyte adhesion within the postsinusoidal venules, compared to sham mice. Treatment with lactated Ringer's reduced the sepsis-mediated leukocyte recruitment by 50%. When septic mice received 6% pentastarch in a balanced solution or 3% saline, venular leukocyte adhesion was reduced by an additional 50%. When the pentastarch was prepared in normal saline there was no further reduction in venular leukocyte adhesion compared to the lactated Ringer's-treated mice. All hyperosmolar solutions improved the sepsis-induced reduction in sinusoidal perfusion but only the pentastarch in the balance solution significantly reduced the number of adherent leukocytes within the sinusoids. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic leukocyte recruitment occurs early in sepsis. Pentastarch in a balanced solution but not in normal saline significantly reduces hepatic leukocyte recruitment, suggesting solution composition, as well as osmolarity impact the innate immune response."
41449279,The impact of neutropenia severity in the setting of recent chemotherapy on mortality in sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of non-relapse mortality in cancer patients, with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia increasing infection risk. The prognostic impact of neutropenia remains unclear across cancer subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, comprising deidentified data from over 141 million patients across 105 U.S. health care organizations. Adults with select solid cancers who received chemotherapy and developed severe sepsis with septic shock from 2013 to 2024 were included. Patients were stratified by neutropenia severity (< 0.5 x 103/microL vs. 0.5-1.5 x 103/microL), and propensity score matching was applied to balance demographics, comorbidities, and treatment variables. Outcomes including short- and long-term mortality, organ failure, bacteremia, and immune-related adverse events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 1083 eligible patients (184 severe, 899 mild-moderate neutropenia), severe neutropenia was associated with significantly worse survival at all timepoints, with median survival of 13 days versus 106 days and hazard ratios of 1.56-2.03 from 30 days to 1 year (all p < 0.001). Secondary outcomes showed no difference in immune-related adverse events, a nonsignificant trend toward increased organ failure, and higher rates of bacteremia in the severe neutropenia cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Greater severity of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia is linked to worse short-term survival and increased complications in cancer patients with septic shock. Stratifying by neutrophil count bands revealed that severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(3)/microL) independently predicts poorer outcomes, emphasizing its value for risk stratification and guiding clinical management."
31814812,Flow Cytometric Analysis of Monocytes Polarization and Reprogramming From Inflammatory to Immunosuppressive Phase During Sepsis.,2019,"Sepsis outcome is determined by a balance between inflammation and immune suppression. We aimed to evaluate monocytes polarization and reprogramming during these processes. We analyzed 93 patients with procalcitonin level >0.5 ng/mL (hPCT) and suspected/confirmed sepsis, and 84 controls by analysis of CD14, CD16 and HLA-DR expression on blood monocytes using fluorescent labeled monoclonal antibodies and BD FACS CANTO II. Complete blood cell count, procalcitonin and other biochemical markers were evaluated. Intermediate monocytes CD14(++)CD16(+) increased in hPCT patients (including both positive and negative culture) compared to controls (13.6% +/- 0.8 vs 6.2% +/- 0.3, p<0.001), while classical monocytes CD14(++)CD16(-)were significantly reduced (72.5% +/- 1.6 vs 82.6% +/- 0.7, p<0.001). Among hPCT patients having positive microbial culture, the percentage of intermediate monocytes was significantly higher in septic compared with non-septic/localized-infection patients (17.4% vs 11.5%; p<0.05) whilst the percentage of classical monocytes was lower (68.0% vs 74.5%). Three-four days following the diagnosis of sepsis, HLA-DR expression on monocyte (mHLA-DR) was lower (94.3%) compared to controls (99.4%) (p<0.05). Septic patients with the worst clinical conditions showed higher incidence of secondary infections, longtime hospitalization and lower HLA-DR+ monocytes compared to septic patients with better clinical outcome (88.4% vs 98.6%, p=0.05). The dynamic nature of sepsis correlates with monocytes functional polarization and reprogramming from a pro-inflammatory CD14(++)CD16(+) phenotype in non-septic hPCT patients to a decrease of HLA-DR surface expression in hPCT patients with confirmed sepsis, making HLA-DR reduction a marker of immune-paralysis and sepsis outcome. Analysis of monocytes plasticity opens to new mechanisms responsible for pro/anti-inflammatory responses during sepsis, and new immunotherapies."
25592017,Ascorbic acid deficiency increases endotoxin influx to portal blood and liver inflammatory gene expressions in ODS rats.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether ascorbic acid (AsA) deficiency-induced endotoxin influx into portal blood from the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the inflammatory changes in the liver. METHOD: The mechanisms by which AsA deficiency provokes inflammatory changes in the liver were investigated in Osteogenic Disorder Shionogi (ODS) rats (which are unable to synthesize AsA). Male ODS rats (6-wk-old) were fed a diet containing sufficient (300 mg/kg) AsA (control group) or a diet without AsA (AsA-deficient group) for 14 or 18 d. RESULTS: On day 14, the hepatic mRNA levels of acute-phase proteins and inflammation-related genes were significantly higher in the AsA-deficient group than the control group, and these elevations by AsA deficiency were exacerbated on day 18. The serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, which induce acute-phase proteins in the liver, were also significantly elevated on day 14 in the AsA-deficient group compared with the respective values in the control group. IL-1beta mRNA levels in the liver, spleen, and lung were increased by AsA deficiency. Moreover, on both days 14 and 18, the portal blood endotoxin concentration was significantly higher in the AsA-deficient group than in the control group, and a significant correlation between serum IL-1beta concentrations and portal endotoxin concentrations was found in AsA-deficient rats. In the histologic analysis of the ileum tissues, the number of goblet cells per villi was increased by AsA deficiency. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AsA deficiency-induced endotoxin influx into portal blood from the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the inflammatory changes in the liver."
41477655,Crohn's Disease Diagnosed Intraoperatively During a Trauma Exploratory Laparotomy.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, commonly presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, typically leading to diagnosis through endoscopic or imaging studies. Its incidental discovery during emergent trauma surgery is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 25-year-old male who sustained blunt abdominal trauma in a dirt-bike accident, presenting to the emergency department the same day with progressive abdominal pain. Emergent exploratory laparotomy for a suspected bowel perforation revealed characteristic ""creeping fat,"" inflammatory adhesions, and an enterocolonic fistula, suggesting undiagnosed Crohn's disease. The presence of acute inflammation necessitated extended small bowel resection and precluded primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent intra-abdominal abscesses, including a subhepatic collection measuring 5.7 x 2.6 x 5 cm, as well as pleural effusions, necessitating multiple drainage procedures, targeted antibiotics, and nutritional optimization. A multidisciplinary team-including trauma surgeons, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, and interventional radiologists-collaborated to manage both acute injuries and the newly recognized chronic inflammatory condition. Final pathology revealed multifocal colonic mucosal ulceration with acute inflammation, ileocolic fistula formation, and colonic perforation, consistent with a penetrating (fistulizing) phenotype, ileocolonic Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad diagnostic perspective during trauma surgery and highlights how an unrecognized inflammatory bowel disease can complicate postoperative recovery. Early suspicion and tailored interventions are crucial for mitigating complications such as abscess formation and sepsis. A prompt gastroenterology consult and confirmatory investigations are recommended to guide long-term management of Crohn's disease. Ultimately, this report underscores that vigilance for atypical findings in emergent settings can significantly improve patient outcomes."

Limulus test--a method for quick diagnostics of endotoxemia].",2004,"Colorectal carcinoma is one of most common diseases in human body. Often it is presented for the first time by its complicated forms--obturation, perforation, bleeding etc. Most common is the obturation of the large bowel. His clinic is caused not only by intoxication of carcinoma, but by massive flow of endotoxin in systemic circulation. In this publication we are trying to explain changes in human body and we offer a test for quick and early diagnosis--Limulus test."
15941170,Close fracture complicated by acute haematogenous osteomyelitis.,2004,This is the first time we encountered a peculiar case of osteomyelitis complicating a closed fracture. The patient was a 38 year-old lady who presented just like any other patient with a closed fracture of the right femur. Intraoperatively we were surprised to find pus from the fracture site. This not only changed the surgical management but altered the subsequent outcome as well.
19912125,Acute respiratory distress syndrome: insights gained from clinical and translational research.,2009,"Acute lung injury and its more severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by diffuse impairment of alveolocapillary membrane in the settings of different predisposing conditions such as sepsis, trauma and shock. Many intrahospital exposures, including aspiration, delayed resuscitation, high tidal volume mechanical ventilation and non critical use of transfusions may contribute or worsen ARDS. Therapy is targeted to treatment of predisposing condition, life supportive measures and prevention of nosocomial complications. Rigorous adherence to lung-protective mechanical ventilation is critical to prevent ventilator induced lung injury and decrease mortality. Although survival of ARDS patients has improved in the last decades ARDS mortality rates are still high and survivors encounter significant physical and psychological impairments."
20010613,A silver-alginate-coated dressing to reduce peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infections in NICU patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the safety of a silver-alginate-containing dressing to reduce peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infections in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive a patch containing silver, alginate and maltodextrin or standard of care. Patches were placed under the regular transparent retention dressing at the PICC exit site at insertion and were replaced with every dressing change at least every 2 weeks until PICC discontinuation. All study infants were monitored for adverse skin reactions. RESULT: A total of 100 infants were followed up for 1922 person-days, including 75 subjects with 89 PICCs who received the patch. The median birth weight (1330 g) and median gestational age (30 weeks) was lower in the patch group when compared with the controls (P=0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Study patients received the patch with their PICC at a median age of 5 days; the patch stayed in place for a median of 13 days. We noted no adverse skin reactions and found no evidence that the patch alters the microbiology of PICC-associated infections. CONCLUSION: This pilot trial suggests that silver-alginate-coated dressings are skin safe and their inclusion in future trials aimed at reduction of PICC-associated bloodstream infections in the NICU should be considered."
15711674,Changing pattern of neonatal bacteremia. Microbiology and antibiotic resistance.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the most important causative agents of bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); their changing distribution and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns over a 5-year period. METHODS: This study was performed between January 1997 and January 2001 at the Microbiology Section, Tripoli Medical Center, Tripoli, Libya. During this period 1431 Oxoid Signal Blood Cultures sets were obtained from 1092 NICU with suspected bacteremia. Conventional methods, API 20 E and API 20 NE were used to identify the isolated bacteria. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was performed to assess their antibiotic susceptibilities in accordance with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: During the study period, 801 sets out of the total 1431 blood cultures were positive for microbial growth, which represented 648 cases of neonatal bacteremia from a total of 1092 cases. From the total number of isolates, the members of Enterobacteriaceae Serratia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp were the most common cause of bacteremia. The coagulase negative and positive Staphylococci were also frequently isolated. A changing pattern of causative pathogen was observed during this study between members of the 3 leading genera of Enterobacteriaceae. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed a high level of resistance among the most common pathogens. Resistance to aztreonam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was less frequently encountered. Staphylococcus resistance to anti-staphylococcal antibiotic and due to hyperproduction of penicillinase enzyme was also high and all isolates were remained sensitive to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria especially members of the Enterobacteriaceae are important causes of bacteremia in NICUs. Although most isolates remain sensitive to the new antibiotics, emergence of resistant strains cannot be excluded in the future. For that reason, new strategies and continuous surveillance are required to monitor the changing epidemiology of pathogens, antibiotic susceptibilities and antibiotic use needed to overcome the increasing incidence of resistance to conventional drugs."
17021536,Sepsis in 2003: are we still in the middle of nowhere?,2004,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although enthusiasm of intensivists has been raised during the last 2-3 years due to several successful clinical trials, severe sepsis and septic shock still have an increasing incidence with more or less unchanged mortality. Within the last 12 months, the progress in sepsis research covering definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, standard and adjunctive therapy, as well as experimental approaches is encouraging. In this review, state-of-the-art publications of 2003 are presented to elucidate the possible impact on clinical routine. RECENT FINDINGS: The rationale for using a new definition based on the PIRO system has been widely acknowledged, although it is not yet applicable in clinical practice. This includes genomic information for stratifying subgroups of patients, and a broader field of laboratory diagnostics due to clinical studies and basic research on the cellular mechanisms of inflammation and organ dysfunction. Early diagnosis is important for a fast implementation of specific therapies, and it has been confirmed that the time until the start of therapy has an impact on patient outcome. Thorough data analysis of successful trials with activated protein C has revealed encouraging details on long-term outcome and subgroup effects. Together with new findings on low-dose hydrocortisone, this stresses the relevance of adjunctive therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock. SUMMARY: Scientific progress in areas of sepsis has been continuing throughout 2003, although the challenges are still enormous. The identification of more specific markers and new therapeutic approaches will hopefully improve the diagnosis, monitoring of therapy, and outcome in the septic patient."
25495520,Lambda-carrageenan treatment exacerbates the severity of cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA in BALB/c mice.,2014,"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to develop and test novel compounds against malaria infection. Carrageenans, sulphated polysaccharides derived from seaweeds, have been previously shown to inhibit Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. However, they are inflammatory and alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, raising concerns that their use as a treatment for malaria could lead to cerebral malaria (CM), a severe complication of the disease. In this work, the authors look into the effects of the administration of lambda-carrageenan to the development and severity of CM in BALB/c mice, a relatively non-susceptible model, during infection with the ANKA strain of Plasmodium berghei. METHODS: Five-week-old female BALB/c mice were infected with P. berghei intraperitoneally. One group was treated with lambda-carrageenan (PbCGN) following the 4-day suppressive test protocol, whereas the other group was not treated (PbN). Another group of healthy BALB/c mice was similarly given lambda-carrageenan (CGN) for comparison. The following parameters were assessed: parasitaemia, clinical signs of CM, and mortality. Brain and other vital organs were collected and examined for gross and histopathological lesions. Evans blue dye assays were employed to assess blood-brain barrier integrity. RESULTS: Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected BALB/c mice treated with lambda-carrageenan died earlier than those that received no treatment. Histopathological examination revealed that intracerebral haemorrhages related to CM were present in both groups of infected BALB/c mice, but were more numerous in those treated with lambda-carrageenan than in mock-treated animals. Inflammatory lesions were also observed only in the lambda-carrageenan-treated mice. These observations are consistent with the clinical signs associated with CM, such as head tilt, convulsions, and coma, which were observed only in this group, and may account for the earlier death of the mice. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the administration of lambda-carrageenan exacerbates the severe brain lesions and clinical signs associated with CM in BALB/c mice infected with P. berghei ANKA."
15608854,"[Meningococcal disease diagnostic criteria in Greater Metropolitan Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil].",2004,"The aim of this article is to evaluate confirmatory criteria: culture, latex agglutination, counter immunoelectrophoresis, microscopic examination, and clinical/epidemiological criteria for cases of meningococcal disease reported in Greater Metropolitan Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, from 1993 to 2002 (568 cases). The following variables were also studied: clinical features, gender, age, city, hospital, case fatality, seasonality, and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup. Culture as a confirmatory criterion was the dependent variable in univariate analysis. The mean proportion of confirmatory criterion by culture was 68.7%. Clinical features of meningococcal disease -- meningitis without septicemia (OR = 2.87; CI: 1.89-4.38) and septicemia without meningitis (OR = 0.26; CI: 0.17-0.45) -- were associated with confirmation by culture. Case fatality rates were different among all diagnostic criteria. More attention should be given to etiological diagnostic confirmation in more severe cases. Diagnostic methods such as PCR may improve etiological confirmation of meningococcal disease in cases with negative cultures."
15799936,Oblique groin incision for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.,2004,"PURPOSE: Groin incision for access to the femoral artery is necessary for stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, lymphatic and infectious complications can occur during wound healing after surgery. A vertical incision traditionally is used, but a new oblique incision technique has the potential to reduce complications. We report our results from AAA stent repairs performed via oblique incisions at our center for a 33-month period. METHODS: Data for 134 consecutive patients undergoing elective stent repair of asymptomatic infrarenal AAA performed by 2 cardiovascular surgeons at a single center from July 1, 2000, to March 31, 2003, were gathered for analysis. Wound complication percentages for infections, paresthesias, sepsis, and seroma were calculated. RESULTS: In 134 patients, a total of 278 incisions were made. Reasons for extra incisions included improving catheter entry angle (5 cases), tunneling for vascular tapes (3 cases), and initial approach too low (2 cases). The percentages were, however, calculated on a per-patient basis. Thirty day analysis revealed a 0% infection rate, 4.7% incidence of paresthesias, 2.38% rate of wound seroma, and 0% wound sepsis rate. CONCLUSION: Because of the nonexistent infection rate and low wound complication rate, our data supports the use of oblique groin incisions for stent repair of asymptomatic infrarenal AAA."
41468900,Septic Synovitis and Osteomyelitis in Foals: Current Situation in a French Referral Hospital and Value of Computed Tomography for Diagnosis and Treatment.,2025,"To describe cases of septic synovitis and osteomyelitis in foals younger than 6 months presented to a single hospital and their management and to report the value of computed tomography in diagnosis and management of these cases.This is a retrospective descriptive study.Sixty-five foals were included in this study. Forty-six foals (71%) survived to discharge. The presence of osteomyelitis (p = 0.16), umbilical infection (p = 0.41), or infection with Rhodococcus equi (p = 1) did not significantly influence survival. However, risk of nonsurvival was significantly increased if multiple sites were infected (p = 0.007; odds ratio [OR] = 5.80) or when bony lesions were present on admission radiographs (p = 0.03; OR = 3.47). A large proportion of the foals in this study had osteomyelitis (66%; 43/65). Computed tomography use was not significantly associated with survival (p = 0.27) but allowed identification of osteomyelitis lesions in 16 out of 43 cases (37.2%) where radiological findings were unremarkable.This study reports a high frequency of osteomyelitis in foals in multiple different regions of the skeleton, with or without associated synovial sepsis. The prognosis, defined as survival to discharge, for these orthopaedic infections is positive, especially if only one location is affected. Computed tomography scan allows an early diagnosis as well as detection of radiographically silent lesions and is an interesting tool in targeted treatments of these foals. Gram-positive bacterial infections were overrepresented in this study, suggesting some similarities with human paediatric orthopaedic infections."
20426289,Radical surgery for incidental cancer gallbladder after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To report our experience in the management of incidentally detected carcinoma gall bladder and establishment of a treatment protocol. METHOD: Retrospective review of 7 patients with incidentally detected carcinoma gall bladder during and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed benign disease. Clinical and histopathological data, treatment and long term outcome of all seven patients were reviewed. Exploratory laparotomy and radical surgery with curative intent consisting of liver resection, lymphadenectomy of the pedicle and excision of the port site were performed in all patients. RESULTS: Liver resection including the segments IVB and V was done in 5 patients and in 2 patients resection of a wedge of hepatic parenchyma of more than 2 cm thickness including the gall bladder bed was carried out. Five patients underwent common bile duct excision with hepaticojejunostomy. Postoperatively, 2 patients developed fever and 1 patient had minimal altered blood in the nasogastric tube aspirate. These were successfully managed conservatively. All 7 patients had disease of pathological stage II and beyond. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient died after 2 months of cholangitis and sepsis. One patient succumbed to metastatic disease after 12 months. The remaining patients are disease free on follow up. CONCLUSION: Re-exploration and aggressive resection with adjuvant chemotherapy for incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder is safe and offers hope for long term survival."
15591708,"Effects of nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on cardiovascular alterations in endotoxemia.",2005,"Prostanoids and cytokines are known to play a pivotal role in the mechanisms leading to endotoxin-induced cardiovascular failure. We investigated the effect of nimesulide (NIM), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, on the cardiovascular alterations occurring during endotoxemia, and on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels in endotoxemic rats. NIM significantly reduced endotoxin-induced elevation of plasma and myocardial levels of TNF-alpha, but not those of IL-1beta. Searching for the mechanism underlying the anti-TNF-alpha effect of NIM, it was found that the drug reduced nuclear factor kappa B activation through diminished nuclear levels of p-65 accompanied by a protective effect against the cardiovascular alterations and mortality seen during endotoxemia. In addition, the inhibitory effect of NIM on endotoxin-induced elevation in plasma and hypothalamic levels of PGE2 was noteworthy, and this may suggest that the large amounts of PGE2 observed during endotoxemia are mainly produced via COX-2."
32015972,Purpura Fulminans: a Rare but Fierce Presentation of Pneumococcal Sepsis.,2020,"Infectious purpura fulminans (PF) is a rare presentation of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) due to diffuse intravascular thrombosis and haemorrhagic infarction of the skin. PF can present in infancy/childhood or adulthood and usually presents as ecchymotic skin lesions, fever and hypotension. It is most commonly a consequence of sepsis related to Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Despite aggressive management of sepsis with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and conventional and nonconventional therapies, the condition still carries a mortality rate of 43%([1]). Streptococcus pneumoniae mostly presents with community-acquired pneumonia. We present a case of PF secondary to DIC related to Pneumococcal sepsis in an otherwise healthy and immunocompetent patient. LEARNING POINTS: Infectious purpura fulminans is a haematological emergency that demands early recognition and timely institution of therapy to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.A characteristic skin rash is a key diagnostic clue pointing to purpura fulminans, and should lead to prompt institution of therapy, as waiting for a skin biopsy result can delay the diagnosis and result in significant morbidity and mortality.Due to the lack of prospective data on management of the condition, various modalities, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and IVIG, still have questionable benefits. We therefore aim to expand knowledge of purpura fulminans management."
41473918,Challenging neonatal central nervous system fungal infection diagnosed by MRI: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Although central nervous system fungal infection (CNSF) is uncommon, it is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. Here, we report a full-term female neonate with suspected CNSF diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) despite repeatedly negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures, in whom the causative pathogen could not be identified. CASE PRESENTATION: A full-term female neonate presented on the first day of life with irritability, hypoactivity, cyanosis, poor feeding, and two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with up-rolling of the eyes and lip smacking. Workup for neonatal sepsis showed negative CSF and blood cultures. MRI findings suggested CNSF, and treatment was initiated with low-dose conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks, leading to complete clinical and radiological resolution. CONCLUSION: Negative CSF and blood cultures do not exclude neonatal CNSF. In resource-limited settings, MRI findings together with clinical response to antifungal therapy may support a diagnosis of probable CNSF, even when the pathogen is not identified and standard high-dose regimens are not available."
20120720,[Procalcitonin in diagnosis and monitoring of surgical infections].,2009,"The procalcitonin (PCT) is a sensitive and reliable biochemical marker used in diagnosing and monitoring of bacterial infections. The procalcitonin assay allows for effective evaluation of the patient's health status. Elevated PCT serum level is correlated with progression and generalization of the infection. In severe infections, such as sepsis or septic shock, the PCT may reach concentrations even up to 1000 ng/ml (with a normal range below 0.1 ng/ml). High PCT levels in the first hours of the developing infection advocates for the bacterial etiology. Therefore, procalcitonin is used in differential diagnosis of severe bacterial and viral infections. Rapid and accurate diagnosis facilitates introduction of the effective therapy. Rapid decrease in PCT level after applying the therapy confirms its efficacy (control assay may be performed after 24 hours since the therapy has been applied). The usefulness of the PCT is supported by the fact, that in pathologic conditions, such as trauma (including surgery procedures), viral infections or autoimmunologic diseases, the PCT level is only slightly increased or remains in a normal range. The PCT level assay enables the detection of the developing infection already in the latent stadium, before characteristic clinical symptoms appear. Therefore, it is very important to monitor the PCT serum level. Further research will allow to determine the accurate diagnostic value and the clinical application of the PCT level as a marker of infection."
41608222,Endotoxin Hemoperfusion as an Adjuvant Therapy for Sepsis: Lessons from the TIGRIS Trial.,2025,"Despite significant advances in antimicrobial therapy and supportive intensive care, mortality in septic shock remains unacceptably high. Hemoadsorption therapies have emerged as adjunctive strategies designed to remove circulating mediators that propagate the dysregulated host response. Among these, polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) represents the most extensively studied extracorporeal modality, specifically targeting circulating endotoxin. Over three decades of investigation have produced a complex body of evidence, ranging from early promising results in small, open-label studies to large randomized trials with inconsistent outcomes. Recent findings from the TIGRIS trial, employing Bayesian design and biomarker-guided patient selection, provide compelling support for a survival benefit in a well-defined subgroup of septic shock patients with intermediate endotoxin activity. This review synthesizes the evolution of PMX-HP research, from EUPHAS through EUPHRATES and TIGRIS, highlighting lessons learned in trial design, biomarker utilization, and patient stratification. These experiences underscore the potential of precision-based extracorporeal interventions in sepsis while outlining the critical methodological and regulatory challenges that remain."
25519197,Comparison of stool colonization in premature infants by three dose regimes of a probiotic combination: a randomized controlled trial.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: To compare stool colonization among premature infants receiving high-dose probiotics versus standard dose. STUDY DESIGN: This blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a Level III neonatal unit. Eligibility criteria were gestational age 27-33 weeks, age < 96 hours, tolerating milk >/= 15 mL/kg/day and availability for follow-up. Gastro-intestinal/life-threatening malformations and necrotizing enterocolitis/sepsis were exclusions. A total of 149 subjects were randomly allocated to groups A through D (received 12-hourly probiotic supplements of 10(10) cells for 21 days, 10(10) cells for 14 days, 10(9) cells for 21 days and placebo, respectively). Key outcome was stool colonization by a probiotic organism at 28 days. RESULTS: Colonization with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in groups A, B, and C versus placebo respectively, but groups A through C did not differ from each other. There were trends toward more colony forming unit (cfu) of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium per milliliter of stool in group A versus B and B versus C. Groups A and B and spontaneous preterm labor (SPL) independently predicted high Lactobacillus counts on day 28; groups A, B, and C and SPL predicted high Bifidobacterium counts. CONCLUSION: Proportion of infants colonized with probiotic species was similar with high-dose and standard dose regimes."
20000067,The burden of malaria infection on pregnant women and birth weight of infants in south western Nigeria.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of malaria infection on pregnant women and the birth weight of the infants in the south western Nigeria. SUBJECT: 262 pregnant women who came for antenatal clinic at Ade-Oyo maternity hospital. 128 were primigravidae while 134 were multigravidae. METHODOLOGY: 2ml of blood was withdrawn from 262 pregnant women who came for antenatal clinic at Ade Oyo maternity hospital. Thick blood smears were prepared for parasite identification and quantification. Anaemia was detected by measuring Hb levels using Drabkin's solution. Age, gravidity and history of treatment with antimalaria drugs were obtained from the subjects using questionnaire. RESULT: The overall prevalence of infection was 41.8%. Primigravidae were more infected (35%) than multigravidae (22%). The prevalence was significantly higher (p<0.05) in wet season than dry season. Teenagers and primigravidae were more infected than the adults and multigravidae. The severity of the anaemia was significantly higher (p<0.05) among malaria positive teenagers and primigravidae than adults and multigravidae. The mean birth weight of infants born to malaria positive was significantly lower (p<0.05) than those born to malaria negative mothers. Malaria positive teenagers and primigravidae had infants with lowest birth weight as compared with adult and multigravidae. The birth weights of the infants were positively correlated with the Hb levels. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that malaria infection, anaemia, and gravidity affect the birth weight of infants born in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria."
19949091,"Distribution, persistence, and efficacy of adoptively transferred central and effector memory-derived autologous simian immunodeficiency virus-specific CD8+ T cell clones in rhesus macaques during acute infection.",2010,"Plasma viremia decreases coincident with the appearance of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells during acute HIV or SIV infection. This finding, along with demonstrations of viral mutational escape from CD8(+) T cell responses and transient increase in plasma viremia after depletion of CD8(+) T cells in SIV-infected monkeys strongly suggest a role for CD8(+) T cells in controlling HIV/SIV. However, direct quantitative or qualitative correlates between CD8(+) T cell activity and virus control have not been established. To directly assess the impact of large numbers of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells present at time of SIV infection, we transferred in vitro expanded autologous central and effector memory-derived Gag CM9-, Nef YY9-, and Vif WY8-specific CD8(+) T cell clones to acutely infected rhesus macaques. The cells persisted in PBMCs between 4 and 9 d, but were not detected in gut-associated lymphoid tissue or lymph nodes. Interestingly, a high frequency of the infused cells localized to the lungs, where they persisted at high frequency for >6 wk. Although persisting cells in the lungs were Ag reactive, there was no measurable effect on virus load. Sequencing of virus from the animal receiving Nef YY9-specific CD8(+) T cells demonstrated an escape mutation in this epitope <3 wk postinfection, consistent with immune selection pressure by the infused cells. These studies establish methods for adoptive transfer of autologous SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells for evaluating immune control during acute infection and demonstrate that infused cells retain function and persist for at least 2 mo in specific tissues."

31811204,DNA methylation of a NF-kappaB binding site in the aquaporin 5 promoter impacts on mortality in sepsis.,2019,"Altered aquaporin 5 (AQP5) expression in immune cells impacts on key mechanisms of inflammation and is associated with sepsis survival. Since epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation might contribute to a differential AQP5 expression in sepsis, we tested the hypotheses that DNA methylation of the AQP5 promotor (1) influences AQP5 expression, (2) is associated with the 30-day survival of septic patients, and (3) alters the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB binding. AQP5 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR in whole blood samples of 135 septic patients. In silico computer analysis of the AQP5 promoter (nt-567 to nt-975) revealed seven putative inflammatory transcription factor binding sites and methylation of these sites was analyzed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to assess the binding of nuclear NF-kappaB to the AQP5 promoter region nt-937. After adjustment for multiple testing, a greater methylation rate was found at cytosine site nt-937 in the AQP5 promoter linked to NF-kappaB binding in non-survivors compared to survivors (p = 0.002, p(adj) = 0.014). This was associated with greater AQP5 mRNA expression in non-survivors (p = 0.037). Greater (>/=16%) promoter methylation at nt-937 was also associated with an independently increased risk of death within 30 days (HR: 3.31; 95% CI: 1.54-6.23; p = 0.002). We detected a functionally important AQP5 promoter cytosine site (nt-937) linked to the binding of the inflammatorily acting nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, with increased methylation in sepsis non-survivors. Thus, nt-937 APQ5 promoter methylation, presumably related to NF-kappaB binding, is prognostically relevant in sepsis and demonstrates that epigenetic changes impact on sepsis outcome."
25534615,Evaluation of real-time PCR and pyrosequencing for screening incubating blood culture bottles from adults with suspected bloodstream infection.,2015,"Several molecular platforms can identify bacteria associated with bloodstream infections but require positive culture bottles as starting material. Here, we describe results of screening 1140 blood cultures at 8h postinoculation, from 918 eligible adults being evaluated for bloodstream infection. DNA was extracted and analyzed by 16S and/or 23S rRNA real-time PCR/pyrosequencing. Compared to culture, PCR/pyrosequencing displayed 90.9% sensitivity, 99.6% specificity, 95.7% positive predictive value, and 99.1% negative predictive value. Overall concordance rate was 98.9% (1127/1140). In 4 cases with molecular-positive/culture-negative results, medical chart reviews provided evidence of identical bacteria from subsequent blood or concomitant urine/sputum cultures. Nine culture-positive/molecular-negative cases were associated with either polymicrobial growth, grew only in the anaerobic bottle of the clinical pair, and/or were detected by PCR/pyrosequencing after 8h. In summary, this approach accurately detected and identified bacteria in ~91% of culture-confirmed cases significantly sooner than the phenotypic identification was available, having the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship."
31889757,Difficult to Treat Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis With Portal Pylephlebitis in the Setting of Idiopathic CD4+ Lymphocytopaenia.,2019,"Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC) is a disease characterized by multiple strictures of the biliary tree, impaired biliary drainage, formation of intrahepatic biliary pigment stones and recurrent bouts of cholangitis. We report the case of a 39-year-old businessman with diagnosed chronic calcific pancreatitis, who presented to us with recurrent episodes of cholangitis, leading to portal pyaemia, and progressive liver failure, which could not be controlled despite adequate biliary drainage. The patient rapidly developed progressive liver failure and sepsis-related coagulation failure. He was also found to have idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL), which resulted in refractory sepsis and formation of metastatic abscesses in the lung and spleen. ICL is now recognised in patients with recurrent and difficult to treat opportunistic infections. The combination of RPC, sepsis and liver failure in the setting of an acquired immunosuppressed state makes this a unique management scenario."
20046633,Infection dynamics and clinical manifestations following experimental inoculation of gilts at 90 days of gestation with a low dose of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,2009,"Understanding the dynamics of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vertical transmission is important to enhance the accuracy of monitoring protocols for endemically infected breeding herds. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of PRRSV within infected litters, to quantify viremia, and to identify specific attributes of infected individuals. Eight gilts were intramuscularly inoculated with 10(1) TCID(50) of a mildly virulent PRRSV strain (MN-30100) at 90 d of gestation. All inoculated gilts transmitted the virus in utero. The proportion of PRRSV PCR-positive piglets and the level of viremia in the piglets were higher at 4 d of age than at birth or at weaning. No specific attributes were associated with PRRSV infection in the piglets. This is the first report, that we are aware of, documenting the efficient in utero transmission of an extremely low dose of a mildly virulent strain of PRRSV. The results support the sampling of piglets late during lactation as a tool to monitor PRRSV shedding from sow-herds."
15610364,Monocyte switch in neonates: high phagocytic capacity and low HLA-DR expression in VLBWI are inverted during gestational aging.,2004,"Pre-term neonates are at high risk to develop early-onset sepsis which possibly is caused by an immature immune system. Monocytes play a pivotal role as professional phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells in the innate immunity. In the present study, we investigated in monocytes from cord blood the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR as a marker for antigen-presenting capability, the expression of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (FcgammaRI/CD64), and the capacity to phagocytize non-opsonized Escherichia coli. We compared 70 infants in three groups according to their gestational age (group I: 20 very low birth weight infants (VLBWI), 24-31 weeks of gestation; group II: 25 pre-term infants, 32-36 weeks of gestation, and group III: 25 term neonates). The expression of CD64 as well as the phagocytic capacity of monocytes from cord blood were highest in VLBWI (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, HLA-DR expression was significantly (p < 0.05) diminished in VLBWI, which possibly leads to a reduced antigen-presenting capacity. We conclude that monocytes have different functional properties during gestational aging, which perhaps participate in the high incidence of infections in VLBWI."
15654518,Sickness behavior of rats with abdominal sepsis can be improved by antibiotic and G-CSF prophylaxis in clinic modeling randomized trials.,2004,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In clinical sepsis research nearly all immune-modulators have demonstrated no benefit in regard to the 28-day mortality rate. Other endpoints such as quality of life have become more attractive, but clinically relevant animal models analyzing an equivalent to quality of life by measurement of sickness behavior are extremely rare. The concept of clinic modeling randomized trials was used in an animal trial to model clinical complexity and conditions of a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: 80 adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to (1) control: anesthesia and sham operation, (2) sepsis: laparotomy and peritoneal infection with human stool bacteria, (3) sepsis with antibiotic prophylaxis: cefuroxime/metronidazole and (4) sepsis with antibiotic plus a cytokine prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF). Endpoints were physiological and behavioral parameters. RESULTS: The combination of antibiotics plus G-CSF was most effective in reducing mortality. All infected animals showed reduced open field activity acutely after infection, and recovery was improved during the 9 day follow-up in rats with prophylactic treatments. In the social interaction test, but not in the elevated plus-maze anxiety test, prophylaxis was also efficient, especially with antibiotics and G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improving sickness behavior in septic rats with G-CSF plus antibiotics may be a promising approach."
25496405,Long-term safety and efficacy of rituximab in 7 Japanese patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.,2015,"OBJECTIVES: The safety and efficacy of rituximab were examined in a multicenter open-label pilot study in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) in Japan. METHODS: Patients with refractory AAV were administered a rituximab infusion at a weekly dose of 375 mg/m(2) for 4 weeks. All patients also received oral daily prednisolone. The primary outcome was complete remission, which was defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 or 1. RESULTS: The mean age of the 7 patients was 57 (range, 34-71) years. The mean follow-up period after rituximab treatment was 62.9 (range, 4.8-81) months. The mean BVAS at entry was 16.7 (range, 2-34). Complete remission occurred in all cases, except in 1 case in which the patient died, with a significant decline in BVAS from baseline at 12 months after initiation of rituximab. Rituximab reduced granulomatous orbital involvement in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Relapse occurred in five patients. Adverse events included de novo hepatitis B in one patient, cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer) in two patients, and transient visual disturbance, atypical mycobacterial infection, urinary tract infection, sepsis, and cytomegalovirus infection. Two patients died due to recurrent infections and airway obstruction, caused by an AAV lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab had a beneficial effect on refractory AAV in Japanese patients, but several adverse effects occurred during rituximab treatment."
31832395,Value of early diagnosis of sepsis complicated with acute kidney injury by renal contrast-enhanced ultrasound.,2019,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with sepsis is high, and the prognosis of patients with septic AKI is poor. The early diagnosis and treatment of septic AKI is of great significance in improving the prognosis of patients with sepsis. AIM: To explore the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), serum creatinine (Scr), and other indicators in the early diagnosis of septic AKI. METHODS: Ninety patients with sepsis during hospitalization at Tongji Hospital of Tongji University were recruited as subjects. Each patient was recorded with relevant basic data, clinical indicators, and CEUS results. The patients were divided into AKI group and non-AKI group according to the results of renal function diagnosis after 48 h. On the 7(th) day, the renal function of the non-AKI group was re-evaluated and the patients were further divided into AKI subgroup and non-AKI subgroup. The differences of the indicators in different groups were compared, and the diagnostic value of each indicator and their combination for septic AKI was analyzed. RESULTS: Systemic inflammatory response score (2.58 +/- 0.75), blood lactic acid (3.01 +/- 1.33 mmol/L), Scr (141.82 +/- 27.19 mumol/L), blood urea nitrogen (4.41 +/- 0.81mmol/L), and rise time (10.23 +/- 2.63 s) in the AKI group were higher than those in the non-AKI group. Peak intensity (PI) (10.78 +/- 3.98 dB) and wash in slope (WIS) (1.07 +/- 0.53 dB/s) were lower than those in the non-AKI group. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The PI (12.83 +/- 3.77 dB) and WIS (1.22 +/- 0.68 dB/s) in the AKI subgroup were lower than those in the non-AKI subgroup, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The area under curve (AUC) of Scr for the diagnosis of septic AKI was 0.825 with a sensitivity of 56.76% and a specificity of 100%. The AUCs of WIS and PI (0.928 and 0.912) were higher than those of Scr. Their sensitivities were 100%, but the specificities were 71.70% and 75.47%. The AUC of the combination of three indicators for the diagnosis of septic AKI was 0.943, which was significantly higher than the AUC diagnosed by each single indicator. The sensitivity was 94.59%, and the specificity was 81.13%. CONCLUSION: The combination of Scr, PI, and WIS can improve the diagnostic accuracy of septic AKI. PI and WIS are expected to predict the occurrence of early septic AKI."
25839765,A study of 65 patients with acquired hemophilia A in Taiwan.,2015,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare disorder that has not been comprehensively reported in the Chinese population. Treatment-related fatal sepsis (TRS), other than hemorrhage, is the leading cause of death in patients with AHA. However, researchers have not systematically evaluated salient parameters, to determine their association with the risk of TRS in this rare disorder. This study reports the salient features of AHA in Chinese patients and presents possible factors associated with TRS. METHODS: Sixty-five Chinese patients with AHA, including 42 men and 23 women, were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years (range = 18-94 years). The features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of various therapies designed to arrest acute bleeding and eliminate autoantibodies against the factor VIII coagulant protein (VIIIi) were comparable to those previously reported. The complete response (CR) rate was 60%, and the median time to CR was 16 weeks. Ten patients (15%) died of bleeding related to FVIIIi by the end of the median follow-up period of 115 months. The estimated 1- and 5-year hemorrhage-related mortality rates were 15% and 22%, respectively. The absence of CR to therapy was the only independent factor associated with shorter survival. The rate of TRS was 20%, and the use of a rituximab-based (Rb) regimen (odds ratio = 8.0, 95% CI, 1.1-68.2) and platelet < 1.5 x 10(11)/L at diagnosis (odds ratio = 38.5, 95% CI, 1.3-1107.6) were the two significantly independent factors associated with TRS. CONCLUSION: The salient features of AHA and treatment outcomes of the patients in this study are similar to those of other patients. Two independent factors (the use of a Rb regimen and platelet < 1.5 x 10(11)/L) were significantly associated with TRS."
25673030,Circulating cytokines in predicting development of severe acute pancreatitis.,2014,"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease process which may present with clinical manifestations ranging from benign self-limited disease to overwhelming sepsis. The ability to predict outcome would be helpful in developing treatment plans, and possibly in stratifying patients for clinical trials."
31842599,Prognostic importance of tissue Doppler imaging of systolic and diastolic functions in dogs with severe sepsis and septic shock.,2019,"The goal of this study was to determine the distribution of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunctions and their prognostic value in canine parvovirus-infected dogs suffering from severe sepsis and septic shock (SS/SS). Twenty dogs with SS/SS (experimental group) and 18 healthy dogs (control group) were used in the study. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction was present in three (15%) and 14 (70%) diseased dogs, respectively, with both types of dysfunction present in two (10%) of the patients. These dogs were split into two groups: survivors (Sv, n = 14) and non-survivors (non-Sv, n = 6). The pulsed wave tissue Doppler (PW-TDI) septal mitral annulus systolic velocity (LVS'), an index of systolic dysfunction, had a high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate Sv and non-Sv animals, with values of 83.3% (95% CI: 41.6-98.4) and 83.3% (95% CI: 59.8-94.8), respectively, at an optimum cut-off point of >/= 9.90. The PW-TDI septal early mitral annulus early-diastolic peak velocity (E'), an index of diastolic dysfunction, had the best sensitivity and specificity to differentiate Sv and non-Sv dogs, with values of 100% (95% CI: 55.2-100) and 100% (95% CI: 78.9-100), respectively, at an optimum cut-off point of </= 6.50. Therefore, diastolic dysfunction determined by E' is a good independent outcome predictor."
16029971,Catheter-related thrombosis in hematologic patients.,2004,"For many years central venous catheters (CVC) have been utilized to monitor hemodynamics and to deliver parenteral nutrition, blood products, pharmacological therapies or infusion fluids. Recently, CVC use has greatly increased with significant impact on the administration of chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and other treatments to cancer patients. However, CVC use may be accompanied by a variety of side-effects, which increase with the duration of implantation. The most common catheter-related complications are thrombotic events and blood-stream infections. The true incidence of these complications is still uncertain and has changed over time due to CVC device improvement. More data are available in solid tumor than in oncohematologic patients. Recently, much attention has been paid to the issues of prevention and treatment of these complications. Some strategies have been proposed: fixed dose warfarin or low molecular weight heparins have been evaluated in some clinical trials of thromboprophylaxis in this condition. However, more studies are still needed to address this issue. This review will focus on CVC use and complications in oncohematologic patients."
25521088,A patient with pleuritic chest pain and abnormal blood clotting tests.,2014,"We present the case of a 58 year old man who developed pleuritic chest while an in-patient; investigations revealed pulmonary embolism, despite a significantly raised Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), which was subsequently attributed to Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The diagnosis and initial management of APS in the acute setting is discussed."
26038166,Dynamic detection of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide helps to predict the outcome of patients with major trauma.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: NT-proBNP and BNP have been demonstrated to be prognostic markers in cardiac disease and sepsis. However, the prognostic value and the dynamic changes of BNP or NT-proBNP in trauma patients remain unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the dynamic changes of NT-proBNP in patients with major trauma (injury severity score >/=16), determine whether NT-proBNP could be used as a simple index to predict mortality in major trauma patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 60 patients with major trauma. Serum NT-proBNP levels were measured on the 1st, 3rd and 7th day after injury The NT-proBNP levels in survivors were compared with those in non-survivors. The efficacy of NT-proBNP to predict survival was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. An analysis of correlations between NT-proBNP and various factors, including injury severity score, Glasgow coma score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, central venous pressure, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I and procalcitonin (PCT) was performed. NT-proBNP levels in patients with traumatic brain injury were compared with those in patients without traumatic brain injury. A comparison of NT-proBNP levels between patients with and without sepsis was also performed at each time point. RESULTS: NT-proBNP levels in non-survivors were significantly higher than those in survivors at all the indicated time points. In the group of non-survivors, NT-proBNP levels on the 7th day were markedly higher than those on the 1st day. In contrast, NT-proBNP levels in survivors showed a reduction over time. The efficacy of NT-proBNP to predict survival was analyzed using ROC curves, and there was no difference in the area under the ROC between NT-proBNP and APACHE II/ISS at the three time points. A significant correlation was found between NT-proBNP and ISS on the 1st day, NT-proBNP and CK-MB, Tn-I and APACHE II on the 3rd day, NT-proBNP and PCT on the 7th day. There were no significant differences in NT-proBNP levels between patients with or without brain trauma at all the indicated time points. NT-proBNP levels in patients with sepsis were significantly higher than those in patients without sepsis at all the indicated time points. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dynamic detection of serum NT-proBNP might help to predict death in patients with major trauma. A high level of NT-proBNP at admission or maintained for several days after trauma indicates poor survival."
25658520,Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.,2015,"This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally."
20006009,Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula in very low-birth-weight neonates: improved outcomes with staged repair.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: The surgical management of esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) involves early division of the TEF and primary esophageal anastomosis. However, in premature infants, the morbidity associated with primary repair remains high, and the optimal surgical approach has not been well defined. METHODS: Medical records of very low-birth-weight infants (<1500 g) with EA/TEF from June 1987 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were separated into 2 groups: (1) primary repair and (2) ligation and division of TEF followed by delayed repair of EA. Demographics, anastomotic, and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-five premature infants with EA/TEF were identified. Sixteen patients (64%) underwent primary repair, and 9 (36%) were repaired in a staged manner. The leak rate confirmed by esophagram was significantly higher after primary repair (50%) compared to staged repair (0%) (P = .034). Strictures occurred significantly more often in the primary repair (81%) vs the staged repair (33%) group (P = .036). Postoperative pneumonia and sepsis were significantly higher in patients treated with primary repair (P = .028). CONCLUSION: Staged repair of EA/TEF in very low-birth-weight premature infants results in a significantly lower rate of anastomotic complications and overall morbidity and should be considered the preferred surgical approach in this group of patients."
31879603,Single center experience of managing methanol poisoning in the hilly state of Uttarakhand: A cross sectional study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: In this article, we describe our experience in managing one of the worst tragedies of an outbreak of methanol poisoning in the state of Uttarakhand in February 2019. It was reported that more than 100 people of Uttarakhand and neighboring districts of Uttar Pradesh succumbed to death after consuming this toxic alcohol laced with methanol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively from the hospital record section of the tertiary care hospital in the state of Uttarakhand. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients of methanol poisoning were attended by the emergency medicine department of our hospital. The mean age of the patients was 38.9 +/- 10.3 years. Majority of the patients were males (92/93). The most common clinical symptoms were gastrointestinal (56; 60.2%) followed by neurological (21; 22.6%) and respiratory (18; 19.3%). Most of the patients presented within 12-24 h after consumption of methanol. The mean of latent time of presentation was 4.8 +/- 2.6 h. The mean values of pH, bicarbonate levels, lactate, and base deficit were 7.13 +/- 0.6, 12.3 +/- 6.4, 2.6 +/- 0.8, and 15.6 +/- 3.8 mmol/l, respectively. Acute kidney injury (26; 27.9%), blurring of vision (9; 9.6%), and sepsis (6, 6.4%) were common complications. Seven patients (7.5%) succumbed to death. Intensive alkali therapy was the main modality of treatment. Ethanol therapy was useful in patients resistant to alkali therapy. Sixteen (17.2%) patients with acute methanol poisoning were dialyzed once. CONCLUSION: Patients with acute methanol poisoning have varied presentations. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common presentation. Such outbreaks account for the heavy toll of mortality and morbidity in the society. Prompt diagnosis and a protocol based treatment can have a significant impact on the outcome of these patients. Thus, public health warning should be immediately issued with initial presentation of the casualties."
41439923,Early CytoSorb Hemoadsorption in a Neutropenic Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patient with Carbapenem-Resistant Pseudomonas Septic Shock and ARDS.,2025,"Neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are at high risk for severe, multidrug-resistant infections. Sepsis due to carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) in this population often leads to septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with historically poor outcomes. CytoSorb hemoadsorption has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy for refractory septic shock, but evidence in hematologic malignancies remains limited. This report describes a 29-year-old male with newly diagnosed AML complicated by neutropenic fever, bacteremia due to CRPA, and subsequent hospital-acquired pneumonia progressing to ARDS. Despite multiple antibiotic regimens and aggressive intensive care management, including mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the patient developed refractory septic shock with persistent lactic acidosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Early adjunctive CytoSorb hemoadsorption was initiated, guided by maximal CytoScore criteria, as part of a comprehensive supportive strategy. Following CytoSorb therapy, the patient demonstrated transient hemodynamic and biochemical improvement; however, profound neutropenia and multi-organ failure persisted. Microbiological clearance of CRPA was not achieved; given confirmed colistin susceptibility and unknown carbapenemase mechanism, a salvage combination of colistin plus ceftazidime-avibactam was employed. Transient hemodynamic improvement was observed after CytoSorb initiation; however, cytokine assays were not performed, and microbiological clearance was not achieved, precluding any mechanistic attribution to CytoSorb. This case highlights the complexity of managing CRPA sepsis and ARDS in neutropenic AML patients, and the challenges in attributing observed clinical improvement to CytoSorb therapy in the context of multiple simultaneous interventions. The absence of cytokine assays (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha) precludes any mechanistic attribution of observed changes to cytokine adsorption, and interpretation should remain descriptive rather than causal. Observed transient changes occurred amid simultaneous interventions (broad-spectrum antibiotics, CRRT, prone ventilation, corticosteroids, and filgrastim), precluding attribution to any single therapy, including CytoSorb. Given the fatal outcome and persistent CRPA positivity, the clinical impact of this observation is limited, and the generalizability of a single-case report is restricted. Cautious interpretation is warranted, and CytoSorb may be considered as part of a comprehensive care bundle rather than as a standalone solution. Alternative tetracycline-based combinations were reviewed but not adopted under our center's salvage protocol for this XDR presentation. Future studies are warranted to clarify its clinical benefit and optimal timing in this population."
20045369,"Gonococcal septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multisystem organ failure: a case report.",2010,"We describe the first reported case of gonococcal septic shock with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure, in which the patient made a full recovery, and add to the paucity of descriptive literature on gonococcal sepsis. The case was a 36-year-old previously healthy Aboriginal female from northern Canada. Treatment included fluid resuscitation, vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy, corticosteroid replacement, activated protein C, and general supportive care. In addition to being the first reported case of gonococcal septic shock with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure in which the patient made a full clinical recovery this is also the first case of gonococcal septic shock treated with activated protein C; an association between its use and the favorable outcome is postulated, but cannot be confirmed."
31814597,Elevated serum bilirubin levels may predict perforation of the appendix.,2019,"AIM: Acute appendicitis is one of the most common pathology requiring emergency operations, and if perforated, can cause morbidity and mortality. The serum bilirubin levels were studied to see whether an elevation predicted perforation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study the medical files of 221 patients who were operated for acute appendicitis were reviewed. RESULTS: Total and indirect bilirubin levels were significantly higher in patients with a perforated appendicitis compared with patients with simple appendicitis. Elevated serum bilirubin had a sensitivity of 50.00 (95% CI 29.93 to 70.07) and a specificity of 80.73 (95% CI 74.43 to 86.05) when predicting a perforated appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS: Appendiceal perforation may be accompanied with elevated serum bilirubin level. Assessment of bilirubin levels must be a part of the initial evaluation of a suspected appendicitis in the emergency room. KEY WORDS: Acute appendicitis, Gangrenous appendicitis, Perforated appendicitis, Serum bilirubin, Total Hyperbilirubinemia."
26185876,Conservative treatment of esophageal perforation related to a peptic ulcer with pyloric stenosis.,2014,"We report a case of esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) caused by vomiting related to a duodenal ulcer with pyloric stenosis. A 45-year-old male presented with left chest pain and dyspnea after forceful vomiting. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive left pleural effusion and left tension pneumothorax. Abdominal CT revealed pyloric stenosis with a remarkably dilated stomach. Tube thoracostomy and nasogastric suction were immediately performed and we selected conservative treatment based on the following factors-a stable general condition without sepsis, early diagnosis, and good drainage. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on hospital day 9 demonstrated a healing ulcer in the lower esophagus and pyloric stenosis. We performed distal gastrectomy as elective surgery for pyloric stenosis due to a duodenal ulcer on hospital day 30. In summary, an esophageal perforation with contamination spreading to the thoracic cavity was successfully treated with conservative treatment."

15641394,Invasive aspergillosis in critically ill patients: analysis of risk factors for acquisition and mortality.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate outcome in patients who develop invasive aspergillosis in the ICU, and to evaluate whether specific risk factors for the acquisition of invasive aspergillosis are associated with mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study (07/1997-12/1999) with screening of 8988 admissions. SETTING: 54-bed ICU of the 1060-bed Ghent University Hospital. PATIENTS: 38 ICU patients with invasive aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis was defined as proven by positive histology and tissue culture and as probable by a combination of clinical suspicion as well as microbiological and radiological data. Seventeen patients had risk factors (neutropenia, haematological malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy). In the other 21 apparently immunocompetent patients, invasive aspergillosis was a complication following ARDS, COPD, pneumonia, acute liver failure, burns, severe bacterial infection and malnutrition. MEASUREMENTS: Population characteristics and outcome were compared for patients with and without risk factors for the acquisition of invasive aspergillosis. RESULTS: Patients with risk factors had higher APACHE II scores. No difference was found between patients with and without risk factors in in-hospital mortality (82% vs. 71%; p=0.431). In patients with specific risk factors, the observed mortality was not different from the mortality as expected on basis of the APACHE II (p=0.940). In patients without risk factors the observed mortality exceeded the expected mortality (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of invasive aspergillosis in this series is 4/1000 admissions. No difference in mortality was found between patients with and without risk factors for the acquisition of invasive aspergillosis. Yet, the prognosis of the patients without risk factors seems to alter more seriously by the development of this infection."
31859198,Added value of inflammatory markers to vital signs to predict mortality in patients suspected of severe infection.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the added value of inflammatory markers to vital signs to predict mortality in patients suspected of severe infection. METHODS: This study was conducted at an acute care hospital (471-bed capacity). Consecutive adult patients suspected of severe infection who presented to either ambulatory care or the emergency department from April 2015 to March 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. A prognostic model for predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality based on previously established vital signs (systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and mental status) was compared with an extended model that also included four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume, and red cell distribution width). Measures of interest were model fit, discrimination, and the net percentage of correctly reclassified individuals at the pre-specified threshold of 10% risk. RESULTS: Of the 1015 patients included, 66 (6.5%) died. The extended model including inflammatory markers performed significantly better than the vital sign model (likelihood ratio test: p < 0.001), and the c-index increased from 0.69 (range 0.67-0.70) to 0.76 (range 0.75-0.77) (p = 0.01). All included markers except C-reactive protein showed significant contribution to the model improvement. Among those who died, 9.1% (95% CI -2.8-21.8) were correctly reclassified by the extended model at the 10% threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory markers except C-reactive protein showed added predictive value to vital signs. Future studies should focus on developing and validating prediction models for use in individualized predictions including both vital signs and the significant markers."
16450538,Epidemiology of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients: experience from southern Saudi Arabia.,2003,"Despite advances in health care, morbidity and mortality associated with acute renal failure (ARF) remain high. This study determined the frequency and etiology of ARF in hospitalized patients in Saudi Arabia over 2 years. Of the 150 cases of ARF, 38.0% were community-acquired and 62.0% hospital-acquired. The main cause was acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in 93 patients, due to sepsis (24.7%), ischaemia (12.7%), rhabdomyolysis (mainly from road traffic accidents) (10.7%), drugs (7.3%) and malaria and snake-bites (4.6%). Overall, 40% died, 48% made a full recovery and 1 patient (0.7%) became dialysis-dependant. Factors associated with poor prognosis were: age 60+ years, community-acquired ARF, peak blood urea nitrogen > 160 mg/dL, duration of ARF > 1 week, need for dialysis and associated chronic liver disease."
20062709,Infective endocarditis on mitral annular calcification: a case report.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Mitral annular calcification is a common finding in elderly patients; it is considered a benign cardiac abnormality but it can be a predisposing factor for infective endocarditis. Although described in numerous necropsy studies, endocarditis on mitral annular calcification has rarely been reported during life, and the frequency of sepsis can be underestimated because of difficult diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of infective endocarditis on mitral annulus calcification in a patient with acute coronary syndrome, diagnosed with transthoracic echocardiography. CONCLUSION: Transthoracic echocardiography may contribute to a correct diagnosis, showing typical findings of infective endocarditis on mitral annular calcification in order to administrate an adequate antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing endoscopic or invasive procedures."
15583290,Detection of virulence-associated genes not useful for discriminating between invasive and commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from a bone marrow transplant unit.,2004,"Because of their biofilm-forming capacity, invasive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, which cause the majority of nosocomial catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSIs), are thought to be selected at the time of catheter insertion from a population of less virulent commensal strains. This fact allows the prediction that invasive and contaminating strains can be differentiated via detection of virulence-associated genes. However, the hospital environment may pave the way for catheter-related infections by promoting a shift in the commensal bacterial population toward strains with enhanced virulence. The distribution of virulence-associated genes (icaADBC, aap, atlE, bhp, fbe, embp, mecA, IS256, and IS257), polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesis, and biofilm formation were investigated in S. epidermidis strains from independent episodes of catheter-related BSIs in individuals who have received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The results were compared with those obtained for commensal S. epidermidis isolates from hospitalized patients after BMT and from healthy individuals, respectively. The clonal relationships of the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. icaADBC, mecA, and IS256 were significantly more prevalent in BSI isolates than in commensal isolates from healthy individuals. However, the prevalence of any of the genes in clonally independent, endogenous commensal strains from BMT patients did not differ from that in invasive BSI strains. icaADBC and methicillin resistance, factors important for the establishment of catheter-related infections, already ensure survival of the organisms in their physiological habitat in the hospital environment, resulting in a higher probability of contamination of indwelling medical devices with virulent S. epidermidis strains. The dynamics of S. epidermidis populations reveal that detection of icaADBC and mecA is not suitable for discriminating invasive from contaminating S. epidermidis strains."
19952286,Lack of fluoroquinolone resistance in non-typhoidal salmonella bacteremia in HIV-infected patients in an urban US setting.,2009,"Non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals worldwide. Recent reports have noted increasing resistance of NTS isolates to fluoroquinolones, the recommended first-line therapy for NTS bacteremia. The outcomes and risk factors for NTS bacteremia in HIV-infected patients in an urban US setting were evaluated. From January 2002 to December 2006, 26 episodes of NTS bacteremia were identified in 16 patients. The risk factors for NTS bacteremia were low CD4 count, high viral load, and lack of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Recurrences appeared related to lack of immune reconstitution in patients not on ART. Unlike reports from Asia, no fluoroquinolone resistance was identified in any of the Salmonella strains isolated in this setting. Optimal treatment of NTS in the HIV-infected patient in the United States should include therapy with fluoroquinolones as well as attaining complete viral suppression and immune reconstitution with ART."
31843507,Septic shock in pediatrics: the state-of-the-art.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Review the main aspects of the definition, diagnosis, and management of pediatric patients with sepsis and septic shock. SOURCE OF DATA: A search was carried out in the MEDLINE and Embase databases. The articles were chosen according to the authors' interest, prioritizing those published in the last five years. SYNTHESIS OF DATA: Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality in pediatric patients. The variability of clinical presentations makes it difficult to attain a precise definition in pediatrics. Airway stabilization with adequate oxygenation and ventilation if necessary, initial volume resuscitation, antibiotic administration, and cardiovascular support are the basis of sepsis treatment. In resource-poor settings, attention should be paid to the risks of fluid overload when administrating fluids. Administration of vasoactive drugs such as epinephrine or norepinephrine is necessary in the absence of volume response within the first hour. Follow-up of shock treatment should adhere to targets such as restoring vital and clinical signs of shock and controlling the focus of infection. A multimodal evaluation with bedside ultrasound for management after the first hours is recommended. In refractory shock, attention should be given to situations such as cardiac tamponade, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, abdominal catastrophe, and focus of uncontrolled infection. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of protocols and advanced technologies have reduced sepsis mortality. In resource-poor settings, good practices such as early sepsis identification, antibiotic administration, and careful fluid infusion are the cornerstones of sepsis management."
15581767,Customised hinged knee replacements as a salvage procedure for failed total knee arthroplasty.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Failure of knee arthroplasty can lead to significant pain and functional disability. In a small number of patients with fracture, sepsis or massive bone loss they are considered for arthrodesis or above knee amputation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the results and complications of using customised hinged knee replacements in their place. METHODS: Since 1993, 30 of the 280 (10.7%) revision knee replacements in the Avon Orthopaedic Centre, Bristol have used Endo customised hinged knee prostheses (21 rotating, nine fixed) for salvage of limb threatening situations in elderly patients. Surgical indications were 22 low periprosthetic fractures (with or without aseptic loosening), five massive aseptic osteolyses, and three deep infections. RESULTS: The mean length of post-operative hospital stay was just 14.6 days and all patients were discharged walking with aids. At follow up (mean 3.0 years, range 0.5-9.3 years) nine patients had died with their prostheses in situ and functioning. Six patients developed deep sepsis, two of which underwent above knee amputation, and two had received further surgery for septic problems. Two patients required further surgery for prosthetic disarticulation and one patient had successful on table vascular repair. Twenty-five patients had mid- or long- term follow up. Their mean American Knee scores (AKS) were 69.8 for knee and 35.6 for function (maximum 100), with mean total knee flexion 83 degrees. Mean Oxford knee scores (OKS) and WOMAC scores (both scored between 12 and 60 with low score indicating less difficulties) were 34.0 and 30.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Customised hinge revision knee replacements gave rapid rehabilitation and hospital discharge. Complications were high but at mid- and long-term review, no prostheses had failed from an aseptic cause and most of the knees of this challenging group were providing both stability and flexion."
31895653,The Effects of Abnormal Body Temperature on the Prognosis of Patients with Septic Shock.,2020,"We aimed to use temperature and the area under temperature curve to represent the severity of abnormal body temperature of patients with septic shock and to observe their impact on the prognosis. Five hundred twenty-eight adult patients with septic shock admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) were analyzed. Within the first 24 hours and throughout the period in ICU, the maximum temperature (24hT(max), T(max)), lowest temperature (24hT(min), T(min)), and the temperature range (24hT(max-min), T(max-min)) were aggregated. Patients were divided into the survival group and the death group. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between body temperature aberrations and survival. The following risk factors of death in 21 days were identified: T(max) (odds ratio [OR] 2.967, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.626-5.414, p < 0.001), T(min) (OR 0.337, 95% CI 0.143-0.794, p = 0.013), and T(max-min) (OR 3.259, 95% CI 1.847-5.749, p < 0.001). This is an observational study, so one can infer association but not causation. Therefore, we infer that abnormal body temperature is associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with septic shock."
41445717,Acute renal failure as the initial presentation of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma: A case report.,2025,"T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL) is a rare and aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by a neoplastic proliferation of immature T lymphocytes that is restricted to nodal/extra-nodal sites with minimal involvement of bone marrow. While T-LBL is the second most frequent subtype of pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary renal involvement in T-LBL is exceedingly rare and can pose a significant diagnostic challenge. We present the case of an 11-year-old male who initially presented with new-onset seizure, hypertensive crisis, and acute renal failure. Renal ultrasounds demonstrated enlarged kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation suggestive of medical renal disease. A kidney biopsy was performed, revealing an atypical interstitial T-cell infiltrate with diffuse expression of CD4, CD8, and TdT, raising concern for T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (instead of leukemia) (T-ALL/LBL). A subsequent bone marrow biopsy was negative, and no other sites of involvement were identified on PET/CT, so chemotherapy was deferred until the diagnosis could be confirmed. The patient re-presented 2 months later with visual changes and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI. Repeat kidney biopsy with flow cytometry demonstrated a population of aberrant T cells with CD4/CD8 co-expression. A repeat bone marrow biopsy contained < 1% blasts, and no aberrant lymphocytes were detected in peripheral blood. CT scan revealed new retroperitoneal adenopathy with infiltrative disease involving kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, and liver, consistent with stage IV T-LBL.Kidney involvement in acute LBL is uncommon, and renal failure due to leukemic infiltration is rarely reported. This case underscores the importance of performing kidney biopsies in cases of unexplained acute renal failure and considering lymphoma in the differential for interstitial nephritis, even in the absence of abnormal hematological findings."
31864875,An emergency medicine approach to troponin elevation due to causes other than occlusion myocardial infarction.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Troponin is an integral component of the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, troponin may be elevated in conditions other than OMI. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with a focused evaluation of troponin elevation in patients with myocardial injury due to conditions other than OMI. DISCUSSION: ACS includes the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), which incorporates assessment for elevated troponin. Troponin I and T are the most common biomarkers used in assessment of myocardial injury and may be released with myocyte injury and necrosis, myocyte apoptosis and cell turnover, and oxygen supply demand mismatch. Troponin elevation is a reflection of myocardial injury, and many conditions associated with critical illness may result in troponin elevation. These include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Cardiac conditions include heart failure, dysrhythmia, and dissection, while non-cardiac causes include pulmonary embolism, sepsis, stroke, and many others. Clinicians should consider the clinical context, patient symptoms, electrocardiogram, and ultrasound in their assessment of the patient with troponin elevation. In most cases, elevated troponin is a marker for poor outcomes including increased rates of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Troponin can be elevated in many critical settings. The causes of troponin elevation include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Clinicians must consider the clinical context and other factors, as an inappropriate diagnosis of OMI may result in patient harm and misdiagnosis of another condition."
19963302,[Evaluation of the potential organ and tissue donor within the pandemic of influenza H1N1].,2010,"The pandemic strain of H1N1 supposes a challenge to the health care system in general and for Intensive Care Units (ICU) in particular. Therefore, it will undoubtedly have repercussions on the organ and tissue donation process. In a possible scenario of bed shortage in the ICU and difficulties in maintaining the surgical activity at a normal pace, a significant effort must be made to assure the maintenance of normal transplant activity, which should not be considered as an elective surgical procedure. Another problem related with the impact of the pandemic on the organ donation process is the possibility that a donor with influenza virus could transmit the disease to recipients. This work aims to clarify this issue, reviewing existing data on the potential transmission of influenza viruses with transplanted organs or tissue, the recommendations published in other countries and those developed in Spain by an ad hoc work group that is made up by representatives from the National Transplant Organization, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy, Regional Offices of Transplant Coordination, and various scientific societies, including SEMICYUC."
32029041,[Evaluation of microcirculatory changes after bundle therapy and prognostic value by the ratio of transcutaneous oxygen pressure and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure in the treatment of septic shock].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate microcirculatory changes after bundle therapy and prognostic values of the ratio of transcutaneous oxygen pressure and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2)) in the treatment of septic shock. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted. Patients with septic shock admitted to department of intensive care unit (ICU) of Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital from July 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled. The gender, age, infection site, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), the length of ICU stay and 28-day prognosis were collected; PtcCO(2), PtcO(2), PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio, arterial lactate (Lac), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured before treatment (at admission) and 6 hours after bundle treatment. According to the 28-day prognosis, the patients were divided into survival group and death group, and the differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The risk factors of prognosis were analyzed by binary Logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of the related indicators for the 28-day mortality of septic shock patients. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients with septic shock were enrolled, with 47 cases in survival group and 31 cases in death group. Compared with survival group, APACHE II score and PtcCO(2) were higher and PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio was lower in death group [APACHE II: 28.33+/-6.35 vs. 21.61+/-6.64, PtcCO(2) (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 51.80+/-19.05 vs. 38.17+/-6.79, PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio: 1.20+/-0.72 vs. 1.80+/-0.81, all P < 0.05]. Compared with before treatment, the PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio, Lac, MAP were substantially improved at 6 hours of bundle therapy [PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio: 1.76+/-0.81 vs. 1.56+/-0.82, Lac (mmol/L): 3.74+/-2.40 vs. 4.42+/-2.60, MAP (mmHg): 83.34+/-7.58 vs. 71.00+/-5.36, all P < 0.05], and there was no changes in PtcCO(2) and ScvO(2). The PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio at 6 hours of bundle therapy in the survival group was significantly higher than before treatment and was higher than that in death group (2.13+/-0.75 vs. 1.80+/-0.81, 1.19+/-0.53, both P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio of death group before and after treatment (1.19+/-0.53 vs. 1.20+/-0.72, P > 0.05). The binary Logistic regression showed that PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio at 6 hours of bundle therapy and APACHE II score were risk factors of prognosis [PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio: odds ratio (OR) = 7.876, P = 0.026; APACHE II score: OR = 0.846, P = 0.035]. ROC curve analysis showed that 6-hour of PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio, APACHE II score and 6-hour Lac level could predict 28-day mortality in septic shock patients, and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.864, 0.784, and 0.752 respectively. The cut-off value of 6-hour PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio for predicting mortality in septic shock patients was 1.42, the sensitivity was 87.0%, and the specificity was 73.3%. In addition, the patients were divided into two groups according to whether the 6-hour PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio was greater than 1.42. The results showed that: compared with the PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) < 1.42 group, the APACHE II score in PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) >/= 1.42 group was lower, the 6-hour Lac level was lower, 24-hour Lac reaching standard rate was higher and the 28-day mortality was lower. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the traditional metabolic parameters, the improvement of early microcirculatory perfusion in patients with septic shock can reflect the effect of bundle therapy. The PtcO(2)/PtcCO(2) ratio at 6 hours of bundle therapy can be used as a new index to predict the prognosis of patients with septic shock which supports the monitoring and evaluation of microcirculation in the early stage of treatment in septic shock."
20008654,Status epilepticus associated with subtentorial posterior fossa lesions.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (SE) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. While seizures have been reported in association with subtentorial posterior fossa lesions, the frequency of occurrence of SE among these patients is not known. OBJECTIVES: To examine prevalence, clinical features, potential risk factors, and outcome of SE among patients presenting with subtentorial posterior fossa lesions. DESIGN: Retrospective review of our hospital database was conducted to identify patients with posterior fossa lesions complicated by SE over 1 year between April 1, 2007, and May 1, 2008. SETTING: Tertiary care setting. PATIENTS: Patients with subtentorial posterior fossa lesions admitted to the hospital for neurological or neurosurgical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of SE, potential risk factors, and eventual neurological outcome. RESULTS: Over 1 year, 13 of 501 patients (2.6%) admitted to the hospital with posterior fossa lesions had SE. Some patients had risk factors for SE such as sepsis, use of particular drugs, or intracranial bleeding, while others had no other clear identifiable cause. CONCLUSIONS: Status epilepticus can be a potential complication in patients with posterior fossa cranial lesions and can be seen in up to 2.6% of such patients. Most have unfavorable outcome."
41478161,Ensemble machine learning for early mortality risk stratification in septic orthopedic trauma: an international cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a life-threatening complication in severe orthopedic trauma, significantly increasing short-term mortality risk. Despite the clinical urgency for early prognosis assessment, current predictive tools remain inadequate. To address this gap, this study used a machine learning (ML)-based framework for mortality risk stratification in this high-risk population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study established ML models to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with orthopedic trauma and sepsis. Data from 2,060 eligible patients were extracted from the intensive care unit (ICU) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2008-2019) in the United State and randomly split into training (80 %) and internal validation (20 %) sets. After handling missing data and addressing class imbalance, seven ML algorithms (including CatBoost [Categorical Boosting], RF [Random Forest], and SVM [Support Vector Machine]) were trained and optimized using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed based on discrimination (AUC [Area Under the Curve], accuracy, F1-score), calibration (Brier score, calibration slope), and clinical utility. The top-performing models were further validated on an independent external Chinese cohort (n = 273, 2020-2024). RESULTS: The study cohort had a mean age of 62.8 years and a 30-day mortality rate of 19.9 % (410/2060). Non-survivors were significantly older, had a higher comorbidity burden, and more severe physiological derangements. The LASSO analysis identified 16 prognostic variables, with age, hematologic parameters (RDW, WBC), SOFA scores, hemodynamic measures (SBP), and antihypertensive therapy emerging as significant predictors. Among all models, the CatBoost algorithm demonstrated superior performance in the internal validation set, achieving the highest AUC (0.955), accuracy (0.884), and F1-score (0.878), along with excellent calibration (Brier score: 0.081). A soft voting ensemble model, integrating the top three algorithms (CatBoost, RF, SVM), was subsequently constructed. In external validation, this ensemble model generalized robustly, maintaining strong discrimination (AUC: 0.842, Accuracy: 0.737) and calibration (Brier score: 0.173), outperforming the standalone CatBoost model. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis provided interpretable, individualized risk assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This study trains, optimizes, and evaluates a high-performing ML-based prediction model for 30-day mortality in patients with critical orthopedic trauma and sepsis. The CatBoost model and the soft voting ensemble, particularly the latter, demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical utility, offering a potential tool for early risk stratification and personalized management in this vulnerable population."

15740964,The predictors and outcome of recidivism in cardiac ICUs.,2005,"OBJECTIVE: Reinstitution of step-up care (recidivism) following cardiac surgery may be associated with increased mortality. This has, however, not been widely reported. METHODS: We, therefore, studied 8113 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve replacement/repair or combined valve+CABG surgery between January 1996 and December 2003 to determine the reasons for readmission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and their outcomes in terms of length of stay in (i) the ICU (ii) hospital and (iii) the in-hospital mortality following recidivism. RESULTS: Of the 7717 patients discharged out of the ICU, 2.3% (182) of patients [mean age 70.4+/-8.35 years (range 30-90 years); 65.4% (119) males] required step-up care. Recidivism was 1.8% (101 of 5633) following coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) and 3.9% (81 of 2084) following valve replacement/repair+/-CABG (P<0.05). The mean interval from ICU discharge to ICU recidivism was 6.6+/-8.4 days (range 6h to 28 days). The principal reasons for recidivism were (i) respiratory failure requiring reintubation and ventilation in 54.9% (n=100) of patients (ii) cardiovascular instability (including that secondary to dysrhythmias) and heart failure in 23.1% (n=42) (iii) renal failure requiring haemofiltration in 6.6% (n=12) (iv) sepsis in 1.1% (n=2) (v) cardiac tamponade/bleeding requiring re-exploration in 7.7% (n=14) and (vi) gastro-intestinal complications requiring laparotomy in 6.0% (n=11) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that, during primary ICU stay, respiratory complications, low cardiac output state, dysrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemofiltration and re-exploration for bleeding were independent predictors of recidivism. Following recidivism (i) the mean length of stay in the ICU was 6.65+/-6.2 days (range 4h to 51 days), (ii) mean hospital stay was 19.2+/-17.3 days (10-60 days) and (iii) the 30-day in-hospital mortality was 32.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are more likely to require recidivism following valve surgery+/-CABG than CABG alone. Whilst respiratory complications were the most common reasons for recidivism in our study, patients who required mechanical supports to maintain vital functions following surgery were most prone to recidivism. Hence, efforts should be made to treat cardio-respiratory problems early in this group of patients to reduce ICU recidivism."
31835489,Highly Sensitive Detection of the Antibiotic Ciprofloxacin by Means of Fiber Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,2019,"Sepsis and septic shock exhibit a rapid course and a high fatality rate. Antibiotic treatment is time-critical and precise knowledge of the antibiotic concentration during the patients' treatment would allow individual dose adaption. Over- and underdosing will increase the antimicrobial efficacy and reduce toxicity. We demonstrated that fiber enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) can be used to detect very low concentrations of ciprofloxacin in clinically relevant doses, down to 1.5 microM. Fiber enhancement was achieved in bandgap shifted photonic crystal fibers. The high linearity between the Raman signals and the drug concentrations allows a robust calibration for drug quantification. The needed sample volume was very low (0.58 microL) and an acquisition time of 30 s allowed the rapid monitoring of ciprofloxacin levels in a less invasive way than conventional techniques. These results demonstrate that FERS has a high potential for clinical in-situ monitoring of ciprofloxacin levels."
41625807,From Liver to Lung: A Pathological Journey of Bilothorax.,2025,"Bilothorax is a rare and pathological condition characterized by the accumulation of bile in the pleural cavity. This phenomenon most commonly occurs on the right side due to anatomical proximity to the liver and biliary system. Bilateral or left-sided bilothorax remains exceedingly rare. Diagnosis relies on pleural fluid analysis, particularly a pleural-to-serum bilirubin ratio >1, and imaging. We report the case of a male patient in his mid-60s with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B7), hepatocellular carcinoma with pulmonary metastases, and multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus and portal hypertension. The patient was undergoing systemic therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, presented with chronic infected wounds and systemic symptoms and later developed gallbladder perforation with biliary peritonitis. Despite multidisciplinary management including percutaneous drainage, intravenous antibiotics, and intensive care support, his condition deteriorated. Subsequently, he developed a right-sided bilothorax, confirmed via thoracentesis, with a pleural-to-serum bilirubin ratio of 3.4 (normal < 0.6). Cultures isolated Enterobacter, and the patient was treated with targeted antibiotics and chest tube drainage. However, he experienced progressive hepatic decompensation, recurrent sepsis, and respiratory failure, ultimately leading to a transition to hospice care. This case is noteworthy due to the extreme rarity of bilothorax, the diagnostic complexity in distinguishing it from other pleural effusions, and the management challenges it poses in patients with advanced cirrhosis and malignancy."
31862240,Mortality and adverse joint outcomes following septic arthritis of the native knee: a longitudinal cohort study of patients receiving arthroscopic washout.,2020,"BACKGROUND: The short-term and long-term consequences of septic arthritis are uncertain. We aimed to determine risk of mortality and adverse joint outcomes following septic arthritis of the native knee. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study in patients who received arthroscopic knee washout for septic arthritis in England between April 1, 1997, and March 31, 2017, using data in the national Hospital Episode Statistics database. Patients with previous knee surgery to the same knee were excluded. Mortality within 90 days, adverse joint outcomes (arthrodesis, amputation, arthroplasty) within 1 year, and arthroplasty within 15 years were determined. Mortality in patients with a primary admitting diagnosis of septic arthritis (ICD-10) was compared with that in patients in whom septic arthritis was a secondary diagnosis. FINDINGS: 12 132 patients were included (mean age 56.6 years [SD 24.9]) of whom 4307 (36%) were female. In 10 195 (84%) patients with septic arthritis as the primary admitting diagnosis, 90-day mortality was 7.05% (95% CI 6.56-7.57; 719 patients), rising to 22.69% (20.80-24.68; 418 patients) in 1842 patients older than 79 years. Secondary septic arthritis diagnosis versus primary diagnosis was associated with an adjusted odds ratio for mortality of 2.10 (95% CI 1.79-2.46; p<0.0001). In 11 393 patients with at least 1 year follow-up, the 1 year rates were 0.13% (95% CI 0.07-0.22; 15 patients) for arthrodesis, 0.40% (0.30-0.54; 46 patients) for amputation, and 1.33%; (1.13-1.56; 152 patients) for arthroplasty. Within 15 years, 159 (8.76%; 95% CI 7.50-10.15) of 1816 patients had received arthroplasty, corresponding to an annual risk of arthroplasty that was about six times that of the general population (risk ratio 6.14, 95% CI 4.95-7.62; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The consequences of septic knee arthritis in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee washout are serious. These findings highlight the potentially devastating outcomes associated with sepsis from musculoskeletal joint infection. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research."

Case study and a literature review].,2004,"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare feverish disease characterised by lymphadenopathy, the most frequently cervical, exanthem, arthralgias and arthritis. It affects especially young women. Patients have high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ES) and leucopenia, antibodies are missing. Course of the disease is usually very benign and can subside spontaneously. However, clinical picture is usually very dramatic and can suggest infectious, autoimmune or malign systemic disease; also association with some of autoimmune diseases was described. Its occurrence is sporadic in all the world, the most of cases were seen in Asia, in the Czech Republic it has not been yet described. Therapy consists in antibiotics administration followed with corticoid therapy and usually can restore patients to perfect health. However, exacerbations have also been described. We describe a case of a 60 year old man, a past top sportsman, who has never been seriously ill except sport traumas and prosthesis implantation for coxarthritis reasons. The last two years he has suffered from exanthem and leucopenia of an unclear origin. In May 2002 he become feverish and arthritis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegalia and exanthem progression, high ES rate and high serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) appeared in him. His condition was first evaluated as septic condition (founded staphylococci in two blood cultures), however, cause of potential sepsis has not been identified. The patient was treated with antibiotics with improvement of his total health condition after second treatment regiment. A neck node biopsy was done because of suspicion on lymphoprolipherative disease and histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis of Kikuchi type was found. Autoantibodies assessment was completely negative. After antibiotic and corticoid therapies his clinical condition quite quickly standardized and ES rate and serum CPR level decreased. 4 month after lowering the dose of prednisolon a temporary exacerbation of the disease appeared and again disappeared after increasing the dose of corticoid."
32232203,A practical marker to determining acute severe ulcerative colitis: CRP/albumin ratio.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: There are many instruments to measure disease activity in ulcerative colitis. While determining clinical activity according to these instruments, many clinical and laboratory parameters are needed to be followed. Determination of disease activity with non-invasive and objective inflammatory indicators may be a practical and objective way. CRP/Albumin ratio (CAR) is an inflammatory marker that is considered to have prognostic value in various cancers, sepsis and acute pancreatitis. In this study, we aim to investigate diagnostic performance CAR in determining the clinical severity of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Between November 2011 and February 2017, hospital records and follow-up cards of patients with ulcerative colitis were reviewed retrospectively. One hundred forty-nine patients were included in this study. Patient's demographic data, laboratory values, clinical disease activity, according to Truelove & Witts criteria and endoscopic activity according to the Mayo sub-score and treatments, were recorded. Diagnostic performance of CAR analyzed to determine the clinical severity. RESULTS: Of the patients included in this study, 99 (62%) were male, and 50 (38%) were female. Mean age was 45.22+/-14 years. When patients were grouped into remission, mild, moderate and severe disease according to disease activity, there was a statistically significant difference between CRP, CAR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and albumin levels (p=0.001; p<0.05). Area under the curve (AUC) values for the diagnosis of severe disease were 0.941, 0.931, 0.888 and 0.883 for CAR, CRP, ESR and albumin levels, respectively. Cut-off value to determine severe disease for CAR was 0.6 (sensitivity: 88.9%, specificity of 90.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 85.1%, negative predictive value (NPV) 92.8%, AUC: 0.941, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between CAR, CRP, ESR and albumin levels and clinical disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis. CAR is a cheap and practical marker for the diagnosis of acute severe ulcerative colitis."
31812793,LncRNA NEAT1 reversed the hindering effects of miR-495-3p/STAT3 axis and miR-211/PI3K/AKT axis on sepsis-relevant inflammation.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This investigation was intended to elucidate lncRNA-miRNA networks that could explain inflammation underlying sepsis progression. METHODS: In the first place, four kinds of mice models were established, namely, SHAM group (n = 30), trauma (TH) group (n = 30), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (n = 30) and TH + LPS group (n = 30). Their lung, spleen and liver tissues were gathered for determination of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 levels. Furthermore, mouse mononuclear macrophage leukemia cell line (RAW264.7) was stimulated by LPS to establish inflammation cell models. Then si-NEAT1s, pcDNA3.1-NEAT1, miR-495-3p mimic, miR-495-3p inhibitor, miR-NC, miR-211 mimic and miR-211 inhibitor were, respectively, transfected into the cells, so as to observe the impacts of NEAT1, miR-495-3p and miR-211 on cytokine levels released by the cells. RESULTS: The survival condition of mice in the TH + LPS group was undesirable, in relative to mice in the LPS group and SHAM group (both P < 0.05). High-level NEAT1 and low-level miR-495-3p/miR-211 were associated with poor survival of mice in the TH+LPS group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the correlation between NEAT1/miR-495-3p/miR-211 level and cytokine level was the strongest among TH+LPS-treated mice, in comparison to mice treated by TH or LPS. Furthermore, up-regulation of NEAT1 level and down-regulation of miR-495-3p/miR-211 level could aggravate inflammation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. The miR-495-3p and miR-211 herein, were both subjected to sponging of NEAT1, possibly affected inflammation responses in RAW264.7 cells, respectively, through modulating STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling. CONCLUSION: LncRNA NEAT1 exhibited great potential sepsis diagnosis and treatment, considering its modifying miR-495-3p/STAT3 axis and miR-211/PI3K/AKT axis in inflammation cell models."
41445732,SHKBP1 is a target for sepsis: evidence from WGCNA and multiple machine learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Identifying novel biomarkers for sepsis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Cuproptosis, a recently discovered form of cell death associated with various diseases, has an unclear relationship with sepsis. This study aimed to elucidate the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes(CRGs) in sepsis, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: We investigated the expression patterns of cuproptosis-related genes in sepsis and performed consensus clustering. A diagnostic model for sepsis was constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combined with four machine learning algorithms. Prognosis-related genes were identified via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and validated in septic mice. RESULTS: We identified 28 differentially expressed CRGs and characterized a specific immune landscape. Our findings showed that sepsis samples could be divided into two clusters based on CRGs expression. We established a diagnostic model based on five key genes(SHKBP1,ICAM2,CTSD,SNX3, and SLC22A4), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that SHKBP1 was significantly correlated with both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of CRGs expression in sepsis, establishes a diagnostic model, and identifies SHKBP1 as a biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis prediction, offering new insights for sepsis management."
25607273,Is this septic shock? A rare case of distributive shock.,2014,"The authors report a rare case of shock in a patient without significant clinical history, admitted to the intensive care unit for suspected septic shock. The patient was initially treated with fluid therapy without improvement. A hypothesis of systemic capillary leak syndrome was postulated following the confirmation of severe hypoalbuminemia, hypotension, and hemoconcentration--a combination of three symptoms typical of the disease. The authors discussed the differential diagnosis and also conducted a review of the diagnosis and treatment of the disease."
15656985,"Gene expression of Toll-like receptor-2, Toll-like receptor-4, and MD2 is differentially regulated in rabbits with Escherichia coli pneumonia.",2005,"Sepsis, a common sequela to Gram-negative pneumonia, results in considerable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether Gram-negative pneumonia alters the expression TLR2, TLR4, and MD2 in lungs or in organs distant to the site of the primary infection. The cDNA sequence coding open reading frames for rabbit TLR2, TLR4, and MD2 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and specific polyclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes were produced to identify changes in these receptors in rabbits with Gram-negative pneumonia. Using tissues from lungs and distant organs, we show that TLR2, TLR4, and MD2 gene expression is differentially regulated in rabbits with E. coli pneumonia. The increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 could play an important role in the innate immune response to bacterial infection in the lungs, and improve pathogen recognition and bacterial clearance. In contrast, the increased gene expression of TLR2, TLR4, and MD2 in organs distant to the primary site of infection may contribute to the deleterious systemic inflammatory response observed in patients with sepsis."
25546609,In vivo T-cell depletion using alemtuzumab in family and unrelated donor transplantation for pediatric non-malignant disease achieves engraftment with low incidence of graft vs. host disease.,2015,"In vivo T-cell depletion, using alemtuzumab therapy prior to SCT, can reduce the incidence of GVHD. This treatment has a potential to delay immune reconstitution resulting in increased morbidity due to viral illnesses. We retrospectively analyzed data on all pediatric patients with non-malignant disorders who received alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimens in our center over the last 10 yr (n = 91). Our data show an OS of 91.2%. The incidence of acute (grade 2-4) GVHD was 18.7% and that of chronic GVHD 5.5%. Viremia due to adenovirus, EBV and CMV was seen in 19.8%, 64.8% and 39.6% patients, respectively, with only two deaths attributed to viral infection (adenovirus). Chimerism level at three month was predictive of graft outcome. Nine patients, who had graft failure after first SCT, were salvaged with a second SCT using RIC and same donor (if available). Based on these results, we conclude that the use of in vivo T-cell depletion is safe, achieves good chimerism and does not lead to increased morbidity and mortality due to viral infections. It is associated with a reduced incidence of chronic GVHD."
25307335,Understanding the PIRO concept: from theory to clinical practice - Part 1.,2009,"Despite recent advances in diagnosis and care of critically ill patients sepsis related mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Therefore, new methods of evaluation are necessary to provide an earlier and more accurate characterization of septic patients. Based on the (oncologic) TNM system, the PIRO concept was introduced as a new staging system for sepsis in order to assess risk and predict prognosis, with potential to assist in inclusion of patients in clinical studies and estimate the probability of response of patients to specific therapeutic interventions."
31952646,CTX-M-15 Producing Escherichia coli Sequence Type 361 and Sequence Type 38 Causing Bacteremia and Umbilical Infection in a Neonate Foal.,2020,"An eighteen-hour-old Tennessee walking horse foal was referred due to weakness and abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed dehydration, distended abdomen, and uveitis. Blood analysis revealed leukopenia, neutrophils' toxicity and left shift. The foal developed bloody diarrhea, gastric reflux, and was diagnosed with sepsis and enterocolitis. The foal was treated with intravenous fluids, plasma, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), partial parenteral nutrition (dextrose and amino acids), flunixin meglumine, and ophthalmic drops. Umbilical ultrasound revealed a fluid pocket adjacent to the umbilical vein; therefore, omphalectomy was performed. Umbilicus and blood were cultured. Results recovered two multidrug-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli clones, identified as ST38 (umbilicus) and ST361 (blood), harboring two different plasmids encoding bla(CTX-M-15.) Antibiotic treatment was replaced with imipenem and amikacin, but the foal deteriorated and was euthanized. Postmortem investigation revealed severe ulcerative enteritis, a perforation site and acute renal infarcts. Sepsis due to several different ESBL-producing E. coli strains should be considered, investigated, and treated accordingly."
41412547,Low-level viremia increases the risk of adverse long-term outcomes in entecavir-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.,2026,"Low-level viremia (LLV) still occurs in some patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) after entecavir (ETV) treatment. We aimed to evaluate the effects of LLV on the adverse long-term outcomes. A secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective cohort study, consisting patients who underwent liver biopsy and received entecavir treatment, was conducted. LLV was defined as detectable HBV DNA levels (20-2000 IU/mL) at week 48 after the imitation of ETV treatment, maintained complete virological response (CVR) was defined as HBV DNA <20 IU/mL. The zero time was defined as the date of LLV diagnosis, the primary endpoint was the occurrence of HCC. The time-to-event analyses were performed using log-rank analysis, and multivariable COX regression. The inverse probability of treatment weighting and propensity score matching were used in the sensitivity analyses. In total, 766 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, and LLV was found in 182 patients (23.8 %). Patients with LLV had a significantly higher 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC (18.7 % vs. 8.1 %, p < 0.001) and fibrosis progression rate (17.5 % vs. 8.7 %, p = 0.017) than those with CVR. Multivariate analysis identified LLV as an independent risk factor associated with HCC (adjusted HR: 3.935; 95 % CI: 2.218-6.979, p < 0.001) and fibrosis progression (adjusted OR 5.342; 95 % CI: 1.630-17.480, p = 0.006). A nomogram incorporating LLV, age, PLT and liver cirrhosis was developed and validated for HCC risk prediction, demonstrating excellent performance with a C-index of 0.778. In conclusion, LLV significantly promoted HCC occurrence and fibrosis progression in CHB patients receiving anti-HBV treatment."
41555989,Adrenal Crisis Masquerading as Sepsis in a Patient With Autoimmune Multimorbidity: A Diagnostic Challenge on the Acute Medical Ward.,2025,"A patient in her mid-60s with autoimmune multimorbidity, including cutaneous lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), and adrenal insufficiency, presented with a five-day history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and profound fatigue. Adrenal crisis typically occurs in individuals with adrenal insufficiency during periods of physiological stress such as infection, dehydration, surgery, or inadequate steroid dosing, and should be suspected when patients develop hypotension, gastrointestinal upset, electrolyte disturbances, or fail to improve with standard therapy. Because these symptoms overlap significantly with sepsis, diagnostic confusion is common, especially in acutely unwell immunosuppressed patients, where infection is frequently presumed. Sepsis itself presents with fever, raised inflammatory markers, hypotension, and generalized malaise, mirroring many manifestations of adrenal crisis and often leading to initial misclassification. Despite correctly applying steroid sick-day rules, which involve doubling usual glucocorticoid doses during acute illness, patients may still decompensate and require escalation to parenteral emergency doses. In this case, empirical antibiotics were started for presumed sepsis after investigations revealed raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and mild hypokalemia with no clear infectious focus. However, the rapid improvement following fluid resuscitation and adjusted steroid therapy highlighted adrenal crisis as the true underlying cause. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for adrenal crisis in any acutely ill patient with known adrenal insufficiency, ensuring timely stress-dose steroid administration before pursuing alternative differential diagnoses."
25516091,Efficacy of intranasal administration of artesunate in experimental cerebral malaria.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Improving management of patients suffering from cerebral malaria is needed to reduce the devastating mortality and morbidity of the disease in endemic areas. Intravenous artesunate is currently the first-line treatment, but the lack of material and skills in the field make it difficult to implement in endemic areas. Intranasal route provides a very easy and direct gateway to blood and brain to deliver medications, by-passing the brain blood barrier. Therefore, it could be helpful and suitable to administer artesunate in the context of cerebral malaria, especially in young children. In this study, intranasal administration of artesunate to rescue from cerebral malaria using a murine model was tested. METHODS: CBA/J mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain received artesunate (20 mg/kg) or a placebo solution intranasally, either on day 5, 6 or 7 post-infection, during a controlled, blinded, randomized trial. Primary endpoint was mortality on day 12 post-infection. Secondary endpoints were parasitaemia and clinical stage. Pharmacokinetics data following administration were collected in blood and brains of treated mice. Local toxicity was evaluated by histopathologic examination of brain and nasal sections in blinded manner. RESULTS: Intranasal administration of artesunate dramatically reduced the mortality rate (p < 0.001), preventing death in most cases. Parasitaemia loads decreased by 88.7% (61.8-100%) within 24 hours after administration. Symptoms of cerebral malaria were prevented or reversed. Dihydroartemisinin was detected in mice blood and brain within 15 minutes of intranasal administration. No direct nasal or brain toxicity was detected. CONCLUSION: Intranasal delivery is an efficient route to timely and efficiently administer artesunate and therefore may contribute to decreasing malaria-related mortality."
31836253,An interpretation algorithm for molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in a maternity hospital using machine learning: proof-of-concept study.,2020,"Allplex Bacterial vaginosis assay (Seegene, South Korea) is a molecular test for bacterial vaginosis (BV). A machine learning algorithm was devised on 200 samples (BV = 23, non-BV = 177) converting 7 identified bacterial strains polymerase chain reaction results to binary output of BV detected or not. Comparing algorithm interpretation of molecular results to the consensus Gram stain (Hay's criteria), the sensitivity was 65% [95% confidence interval (CI) 42-83%], specificity was 98% (95% CI 95-99%), positive predictive value was 83% (95% CI 58-96%), and negative predictive value was 95% (91-98%) with area under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI 0.76-0.87). For the second phase, 100 samples were processed using the 2 techniques in parallel, with the scientists blinded to the result of the other method. There was agreement 90% of the cases (n = 90/100). The samples that were called BV by the algorithm but non-BV by Gram stain all cluster with the concordant BV samples, suggesting that the molecular test was correct."
20037703,How is mechanical ventilation employed in a pediatric intensive care unit in Brazil?,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between mechanical ventilation and mortality and the practice of mechanical ventilation applied in children admitted to a high-complexity pediatric intensive care unit in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted to a Brazilian high-complexity PICU who were placed on mechanical ventilation for 24 hours or more, between October 1(st), 2005 and March 31(st), 2006. RESULTS: Of the 241 patients admitted, 86 (35.7%) received mechanical ventilation for 24 hours or more. Of these, 49 met inclusion criteria and were thus eligible to participate in the study. Of the 49 patients studied, 45 had chronic functional status. The median age of participants was 32 months and the median length of mechanical ventilation use was 6.5 days. The major indication for mechanical ventilation was acute respiratory failure, usually associated with severe sepsis / septic shock. Pressure ventilation modes were the standard ones. An overall 10.37% incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome was found, in addition to tidal volumes > 8 ml/kg, as well as normo- or hypocapnia. A total of 17 children died. Risk factors for mortality within 28 days of admission were initial inspiratory pressure, pH, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, oxygenation index and also oxygenation index at 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Initial inspiratory pressure was also a predictor of mechanical ventilation for periods longer than 7 days. CONCLUSION: Of the admitted children, 35.7% received mechanical ventilation for 24 h or more. Pressure ventilation modes were standard. Of the children studied, 91% had chronic functional status. There was a high incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, but a lung-protective strategy was not fully implemented. Inspiratory pressure at the beginning of mechanical ventilation was a predictor of mortality within 28 days and of a longer course of mechanical ventilation."
15678979,[Bacteremia due to Clostridium difficile].,2004,"We describe a case of bacteremia due to Clostridium difficile, which was successfully treated by intravenous vancomycin. A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of third degree burn injuries. She was treated with cefazolin for two weeks followed with flomoxef for one week before the operation (debridement and grafting of skin). On the third postoperative day high fever (temperature 40 degrees C), abdominal pain and severe watery diarrhea developed. Antibiotic-associated colitis with bacteremia was diagnosed presumptively, flomoxef was stopped, and oral and intravenous therapy with vancomycin was started. A blood culture taken before the administration of vancomycin yielded C. difficile accompanied with Enterococcus faecalis and Enetrococcus casseliflavus. A stool culture taken on the next day yielded C. difficile, and a stool latex agglutination test was also positive. The patient improved slowly. Parenteral vancomycin was discontinued after two weeks. One week later, the patient developed pneumonia, and imipenem/cilastatin was added. Soon after addition of the agent, she developed recurrent diarrhea despite continual oral vancomycin therapy. The fecal samples obtained at this time were positive for C. difficile by culture and positive for toxins A & B. She was satisfactorily treated with oral vancomycin for a total of four weeks. After the following two weeks, however, recurrence of diarrhea developed again, which rapidly decreased with oral vancomycin for seven days. The patient did well thereafter and was discharged. All three C. difficile isolates from blood and fecal specimens were positive for toxins A & B, and identified the same PCR ribotyping pattern."
41556021,Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case Series.,2025,"Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a rare and poorly understood manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, encompassing a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In order to highlight the diagnostic complexity and therapeutic challenges of NPSLE, this report presents the management of three distinct presentations. We retrospectively reviewed cases of three female patients with NPSLE admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment strategies, and outcomes were analyzed. Each case demonstrated unique NPSLE manifestations: acute confusional state in the setting of sepsis, cerebral vasculitis with retinal involvement, and catatonia. Treatments included high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil, with varying degrees of clinical improvement. NPSLE remains a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity and lack of definitive biomarkers. Early recognition and individualized immunosuppressive treatment are essential for improved outcomes."
32000925,Neonatal and Infant Appendicitis.,2020,"Neonatal appendicitis is a rare disease with a high mortality rate. Appendicitis is difficult to diagnose in neonatal and infant populations because it mimics other more common conditions in these age groups. Furthermore, signs and symptoms of appendicitis are often nonspecific in nonverbal patients and a high index of suspicion is necessary to initiate the appropriate diagnostic work-up. The keys to successful management of appendicitis in infants include keeping the diagnosis on the differential in the setting of unexplained intra-abdominal sepsis, following a diagnostic algorithm in the work-up of infant abdominal pathology, and performing appendectomy once the diagnosis is confirmed."
15580546,Streptococcus pneumoniae: an old bug with significant maternal-newborn implications.,2004,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an uncommon organism identified in neonatal bacteremia, but when it occurs, it has serious implications for both the infant and the mother. Despite the similarities in the manifestations between group B streptococcus and S. pneumoniae sepsis, the latter appears to be more virulent and of marked severity, resulting in significant neonatal mortality. In the absence of a routine maternal screening protocol for S. pneumoniae colonization, aggressive newborn management constitutes the mainstay of treatment."
20503111,Neurologic changes during critical illness: brain imaging findings and neurobehavioral outcomes.,2010,"Encephalopathy and other neurologic morbidities are common in critical illness, sepsis, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We assessed structural changes on brain imaging and neuropsychological outcomes in critically ill patients who developed neurological changes during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Patients who underwent brain imaging for neurological changes were included in the study. Medical, neuroradiological, and outcome data were obtained from patient medical records. Sixty-four patients underwent brain imaging for neurological changes. Forty-one (64%) patients had abnormalities on brain imaging. There were no differences for age, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or APACHE II scores for patients with normal compared to abnormal brain imaging. Cognitive impairments occurred in 48% of survivors and 6% developed psychiatric disorders. Our study demonstrates that abnormalities on brain imaging are common in critically ill patients. We also confirm previous findings that survivors of critical illness have cognitive impairments post-ICU discharge. This study further illustrates the adverse effects of critical illness on the brain and highlights the need for additional research in this emerging area."
15776648,[Acquired bacteraemias at the intensive care unit].,2003,"Acquired bacteraemias in intensive care unit (ICU) have some serious consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality and costs. The emergence of multiresistant germs in ICUs, and the therapeutic difficulties that ensue, participate in the aggravation of the prognosis of these infections. The aim of this work was to study the epidemiological aspects of acquired bacteraemias in ICU and the responsible germs sensitivity, to determine strategies of adequate antimicrobial treatment. During the period of study, 31 positive blood cultures collected from 19 patients were considered to be true bacteraemias, giving an incidence rate of 6.3 for 100 admissions. The mean age of our patients was 27.7 years old. There were 16 men and 3 women. Traumatology was the underlying pathology in 52.63% of cases. The origin of the infection was unknown in 84.2%. Flavobacterium spp was the most frequent germ (42%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%), and Staphylococcus negative coagulase (10.6%). Only one anaerobic germ was isolated. Flavobacterium spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were in general sensitive to most antibiotics used with the exception of aminosides. Staphylococci negative coagulase were methi - resistant. The sensitivity of the anaerobic germ was not tested. The antimicrobial treatment was adapted in 84.2% of cases; the association ciprofloxacine-cefotaxime could be a good alternative in serious infections to Gram negative bacteria. The global death rate among our patients was 42%. The death was directly related to bactereamia in only 15.3% of cases. The existing committee for nosocomial infections control should be more effective in our hospital. The role of this committee is to carry out microbiological surveillance, to recommand and make sure of the application of preventive measures against nosocomial infections, to promote the accessibility of antibiotics such as imipeneme, aztreonam, ceftazidime, vancomycine...., and to propose an appropriate antimicrobial treatment strategy; these measures could reduce notably the morbidity and mortality related to nosocomial infections in general and bactereamias in particular."
25651702,Intraosseous samples can be used for creatinine measurements--an experimental study in the anaesthetised pig.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Intraosseous (IO) access is a valuable tool in prehospital locations and in emergency departments when other forms of vascular access are unavailable. Creatinine is often used for dose adjustment of drugs that may be administered through intraosseous cannulae. We aimed to study the possibility of analysing creatinine in intraosseous samples and study the accuracy and precision of such measurements. METHODS: Eight pigs with endotoxin induced septic shock were sampled hourly for six hours and analysed for plasma creatinine. Samples were collected from arterial, venous, and IO cannulae. RESULTS: There was an increase in creatinine values during the later part of the experiment. The coefficients of variation between the three sampling sites were less than 10% at all sampling times. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings intraosseous samples can be used for creatinine determination in emergency settings."

While some advances have been made in decreasing the rate of bacterial contamination of platelet units, particularly through diversion methods and early culture, a great deal remains to be done to eliminate the problem. Diversion methods have decreased contamination rates associated with skin commensal organisms. Culture methods are now widely used and many at-issue detection methods have been developed or are undergoing development. This article reviews the current developments and the challenges that remain to minimize and detect bacterial contamination of platelet products."
31868078,Hemoadsorption by extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy (CytoSorb((R))) in the management of septic shock: A retrospective observational study.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis results in immunologic disturbances with the release of various inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Cytokines can damage the cells, and the continuous release of inflammatory mediators leads to severely impaired immunity. Therefore, the reduction in cytokine levels by hemoadsorption represents a new concept for blood purification. CytoSorb((R)) as a hemoadsorption device is a detoxification system, which aims to decrease the cytokines levels. This study was conducted to understand any beneficial effects of CytoSorb((R)) therapy in septic patients. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective and observational study, approved by the scientific and ethics committee of Max Super Specialty Hospital, Patparganj, Delhi, India and conducted in compliance with current International Council for Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice, Schedule Y, and Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines. Subjects of either gender (age > 18 year) were included in the study. The data were presented as mean +/- standard deviation and categorical as frequency and percentage (%). A p value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: A total number of 36 patients were included in the study. Majority of the patients were male with mean age (56.36 +/- 14.83). After therapy, procalcitonin and total leucocyte count levels decreased within 24 h. Post therapy, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of Day (D)1, D2, and D3 reduced to 10.4 +/- 3.63, 8.7 +/- 4.02, and 7.8 +/- 3.67, respectively. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and predicted mortality were lower in the survivor group as compared to the non-survivor group. CONCLUSION: Hemoadsorption using the extracorporeal adsorption device (CytoSorb((R))) might be an effective rescue therapy in stabilizing septic shock patients."
31946575,A Multilayer Monte Carlo Model for the Investigation of Optical Path and Penetration Depth at Different Perfusion States of the Colon.,2019,"There is a great interest in monitoring the oxygen supply delivered to the colon. Insufficient oxygen delivery may lead to hypoxia, sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction and death. For assessing colonic perfusion, more information and understanding is required relating to the light-interaction within the colonic tissue. A multilayer Monte Carlo model of a healthy human colon has been developed to investigate the light-tissue behavior during different perfusion states within the mucosal layer of the colon. Results from a static multilayer model of optical path and reflectance at two wavelengths, 660 nm and 880 nm, through colon tissue, containing different volume fractions of blood with a fixed oxygen saturation are presented. The effect on the optical path and penetration depth with varying blood volumes within the mucosa for each wavelength has been demonstrated. The simulation indicated both wavelengths of photons penetrated similar depths, entering the muscularis layer."
41520250,Comparison of bacteraemic & non-bacteraemic brucellosis: A retrospective analysis of 2 years.,2025,"Background & objectives Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease that affects both humans and animals, with diagnosis traditionally confirmed by bacteriological culture of blood or tissue samples. This study aimed to identify clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory parameters that predict culture positivity in brucellosis cases. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-centre study including 130 patients with brucellosis diagnosed between January 2023 and December 2024. Patients were classified as bacteraemic (n=60) and non-bacteraemic (n=70). Demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory parameters, and treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results Patients with bacteraemia had higher rates of summer admissions, more frequent exposure to animal husbandry, and shorter symptom duration. Clinical manifestations such as back pain, headache, weight loss, and abdominal pain were more common in them. Laboratory findings showed lower leukocyte and, neutrophil counts, lower haemoglobin, lower platelet counts, in bacteraemic patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in bacteraemic vs non-bacteraemic patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that AST had the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.841, 95% CI: 0.758-0.924), with an optimal cut-off of 27.3 U/L, yielding 67.2 per cent sensitivity and 84.1 per cent specificity. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that exposure history (OR=5.5), residence in a high-incidence geographic location (OR=10.0), and clinical features such as back pain (OR = 9.4), together with low haemoglobin and elevated AST levels, were independent predictors of blood culture positivity in brucellosis. Interpretation & conclusions It may be possible to predict bacteraemia in brucellosis by using a combination of epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory criteria."
25541241,"Phagocytic activity of monocytes, their subpopulations and granulocytes during post-transplant adverse events after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",2015,"Phagocytosis of granulocytes and monocytes presents a major mechanism that contributes to the clearance of pathogens and cell debris. We analyzed the phagocytic activity of the peripheral blood cell monocytes, three monocyte subpopulations and granulocytes before and up to one year after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as during transplant-related adverse events. 25 pediatric patients and young adults (median age of 11.0 years) with hemato-oncological malignancies and non malignancies were enrolled in the prospective study. Ingestion of fluorescence-labeled Escherichia coli bacteria was used to assess the phagocytic activity of monocytes and their subpopulations and granulocytes by means of flow cytometry in the patient group as well as in a control group (n=36). During sepsis, a significant increase of phagocytic activity of monocytes (P=0.0003) and a significant decrease of the phagocytic activity of granulocytes (P=0.0003) and the CD14+ CD16++ monocyte subpopulation (P=0.0020) occurred. At the onset of a veno-occlusive disease, a significant increase of phagocytic activity in the CD14++ CD16+ monocyte subpopulation (P=0.001) and a significant decrease in the phagocytic activity of the CD14++ CD16- monocyte subpopulation (P=0.0048) were observed. In conclusion, the phagocytic activity of monocytes, their subpopulations and granulocytes might be a useful and easy determinable parameter that enables identification of post-transplant complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The alterations of phagocytic activity contribute to the altered immune response that accompanies adverse events after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
25524592,The arterial blood pressure associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse in critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Liberal and overaggressive use of vasopressors during the initial period of shock resuscitation may compromise organ perfusion and worsen outcome. When transiently applying the concept of permissive hypotension, it would be helpful to know at which arterial blood pressure terminal cardiovascular collapse occurs. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to identify the arterial blood pressure associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse in 140 patients who died in the intensive care unit while being invasively monitored. Demographic data, co-morbid conditions and clinical data at admission and during the 24 hours before and at the time of terminal cardiovascular collapse were collected. The systolic, mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures immediately before terminal cardiovascular collapse were documented. Terminal cardiovascular collapse was defined as an abrupt (<5 minutes) and exponential decrease in heart rate (> 50% compared to preceding values) followed by cardiac arrest. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) values of the systolic, mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse were 47 +/- 12 mmHg, 35 +/- 11 mmHg and 29 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively. Patients with congestive heart failure (39 +/- 13 mmHg versus 34 +/- 10 mmHg; P = 0.04), left main stem stenosis (39 +/- 11 mmHg versus 34 +/- 11 mmHg; P = 0.03) or acute right heart failure (39 +/- 13 mmHg versus 34 +/- 10 mmHg; P = 0.03) had higher arterial blood pressures than patients without these risk factors. Patients with severe valvular aortic stenosis had the highest arterial blood pressures associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse (systolic, 60 +/- 20 mmHg; mean, 46 +/- 12 mmHg; diastolic, 36 +/- 10 mmHg), but this difference was not significant. Patients with sepsis and patients exposed to sedatives or opioids during the terminal phase exhibited lower arterial blood pressures than patients without sepsis or administration of such drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The arterial blood pressure associated with terminal cardiovascular collapse in critically ill patients was very low and varied with individual co-morbid conditions (for example, congestive heart failure, left main stem stenosis, severe valvular aortic stenosis, acute right heart failure), drug exposure (for example, sedatives or opioids) and the type of acute illness (for example, sepsis)."
33117982,Non-faradaic electrochemical impedimetric profiling of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as a dual marker biosensor for early sepsis detection.,2019,"In this work, we demonstrate a robust, dual marker, biosensing strategy for specific and sensitive electrochemical response of Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in complex body fluids such as human serum and whole blood for the detection of sepsis. Enhanced sensitivity is achieved by leveraging the physicochemical properties of zinc oxide at the electrode-solution interface. Characterization techniques such as SEM, EDAX, AFM, FTIR and fluorescence microscopy were performed to ensure a suitable biosensing surface. The characteristic biomolecular interactions between the target analyte and specific capture probe is quantified through unique frequency signatures using non-faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The developed biosensor demonstrated a detection limit of 0.10 ng mL(-1) for PCT in human serum and whole blood with an R(2) of 0.99 and 0.98 respectively. CRP demonstrated a detection limit of 0.10 mug mL(-1) in human serum and whole blood with an R(2) of 0.90 and 0.98 respectively. Cross-reactivity analysis demonstrated robust selectivity to PCT and CRP with negligible interaction to non-specific biomolecules. The novel aspect of this technology is the ability to fine-tune individual biomarkers response owing to the optimal frequency tuning capability. The developed biosensor requires an ultra-low sample volume of 10 muL without the need for sample dilution for rapid analysis. We envision the developed dual marker biosensor to be useful as a sepsis-screening device for prognostic monitoring."
31863394,Pediatric Blood Cultures and Antibiotic Resistance: An Overview.,2020,"Bloodstream infections (BSI) due to multidrug-resistant organisms, especially from pediatric intensive care units (PICU), are being increasingly reported across the world. Since BSI is associated with high mortality, it is essential to treat these infections early with appropriate antibiotics. Surveillance of etiology and emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered an important step in the formulation of antibiotic policy for early treatment and judicious use of antibiotics. In this review on etiology and its antibiogram in community acquired BSI, S. typhi followed by S. paratyphi A were the major bacterial isolates. Quinolone resistance of more than 90% in Salmonella is now reported from all over India. Ceftriaxone remains the drug of choice for enteric fever due to its 100% susceptibility. In PICU there is an emergence of candidemia due to non-albicans candida which are now predominant isolates at few centers. BSI due to gram-negative bacteria, mostly by Klebseilla pneumoniae and gram-positive cocci (S. aureus) are the other major pathogens commonly observed in BSI from PICU. There is a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin (94.9%-90.7%), cefotaxime (92.4%-71.4%), piperacillin-tazobactum (31.2%-27.5%) and levofloxacin (42.4%-39.8%). Resistance to carbapenems, primarily due to bla(NDM) is seen in all the centers and the rate varies between 1%- 79% with K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii showing the maximum resistance. This review highlights the magnitude of the AMR in the pediatric population and calls for the urgent implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs to save the remaining antimicrobials."
19931809,Blood culture systems: rapid detection--how and why?,2009,"Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Blood culture is considered to be the most important tool in their diagnosis. In this study we compared standard blood culture with two different molecular techniques (Prove-it Sepsis and LightCycler SeptiFast M) to detect bacterial species and fungi in the blood of septic patients. Both methods showed significant agreement with the results obtained by blood culture. The results of these studies suggest that both the LightCycler SeptiFast and Prove-it Sepsis tests can be used for the rapid and specific diagnosis of bacteraemia and bloodstream infections. It is important, however, to emphasize that molecular methods cannot replace blood cultures, as the latter allow the evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated microbes."
15597796,[Monocyte HLA-DR expression as predictors of clinical outcome for patients with sepsis].,2004,"It has been generally accepted that the frequency of the HLA-DR-antigen expression on monocytes reflects the individual's immune state; therefore it has been regarded as a key indicator of the immune status in SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)-sepsis. One of the diagnostic indices for the level of immunoparalysis, it characterizes CARS (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome). Lately, it has been frequently reported that the frequency of HLA-DR-antigen expression on monocytes is abnormally reduced in those patients with SIRS-sepsis. Reports suggest that the prognosis is very poor in cases with long-term sharp declines in HLA-DR-antigen expression on monocytes."
41458791,Shivering During Transurethral Ureterolithotripsy Predicted Postoperative Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"Patients may develop septic shock following transurethral ureterolithotripsy (TUL). However, intraoperative symptoms that may be indicative of sepsis remain largely understudied. We encountered a case in which shivering during spinal anesthesia predicted bacteremia, consequently enabling early therapeutic intervention for sepsis. A 68-year-old woman had diabetes, severe obesity (BMI 45 kg/m(2)), sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient was hospitalized multiple times for calculous pyelonephritis due to a right, coral-shaped calculus and received antimicrobial therapy. TUL was scheduled for the right coral-shaped calculus. Spinal anesthesia was administered, and surgery was initiated after confirming loss of cold sensation at T4. The patient developed severe shivering, nausea, and vomiting approximately 50 minutes after lithotripsy initiation. Vital signs showed no significant changes compared with those at admission and did not indicate shock. However, the symptoms were considered initial signs of bacteremia. Therefore, surgery was terminated. Arterial and central venous lines were inserted while the patient was in the operating room, before admission to the ICU. Upon ICU admission, the patient presented with hypotension (systolic blood pressure </=70 mmHg) and hyperlactatemia. The patient was consequently diagnosed with septic shock. Norepinephrine, dobutamine, and respiratory support were initiated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Tracheal intubation and vasopressin administration were performed the day after surgery. Thermoregulatory shivering can occur during spinal anesthesia, owing to the use of intrapyelic perfusion fluid during lithotripsy. However, the shivering observed in this case was highly likely to be the initial symptom of bacteremia. Furthermore, the patient had a preoperative urinary tract infection, suggesting a high risk for sepsis and endotoxic shock. This case confirms that chills and rigors may be early indicators of bacteremia. Moreover, it suggests that intraoperative shivering is an initial symptom of bacteremia."
15599468,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia in adults: four years' experience in a medical center in northern Taiwan.,2004,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has become an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients in Taiwan. Patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes, uremia, and solid malignancy are extremely vulnerable to this organism. S. maltophilia bacteremia has a mortality rate of up to 62% if appropriate antibiotics are not instituted early. Knowledge of the risk factors for infection as well as local susceptibility patterns is helpful in determining which patients should receive empirical antibiotics active against S. maltophilia. This study assessed the characteristics of 50 episodes of S. maltophilia bacteremia in 48 patients admitted between March 3, 1999 and May 21, 2003. The new fluoroquinolone levofloxacin showed promising in vitro activity against S. maltophilia in view of the increasing resistance of isolates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For patients at risk for S. maltophilia infection, such as those receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU or those with multiple vascular access devices, the need for antimicrobial agents to which S. maltophilia is normally sensitive should be considered in selecting empiric therapy."
15580392,Primary peritonitis associated with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: report of a case.,2004,"Several reports over the past 15 years describe severe group A streptococcal infections causing septic shock, soft-tissue necrosis, and multiple organ failure; a phenomenon known as streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). However, primary peritonitis associated with TSLS is rare. We report the case of a 40-year-old man admitted with pain in both thighs, hypotension, and severe abdominal pain. His daughter had been diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis 3 days earlier. We performed an emergency laparotomy for peritonitis, and culture of the ascites was positive for group A beta -hemolytic streptococcus (GAS). Further serotyping of the isolated GAS strain revealed the T-type 22 and the pyrogenic exotoxin gene, spe-C. The criteria for TSLS were clearly met, including the isolation of GAS from ascites, hypotension, liver failure, renal failure, coagulopathy, myositis, and a generalized erythematous macular rash with desquamation."
15578805,Sequential organ failure assessment score as the determinant of outcome for patients with severe sepsis.,2004,"AIM: To evaluate the impact of organ dysfunction in severe sepsis and determine the effectiveness of organ dysfunction scores to discriminate outcome after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis and at least one organ dysfunction on the first day in the ICU (n=117) were included in the prospective observational study. The presence of organ dysfunction was assessed using a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). The severity of illness was assessed using a Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II during the first 24 hours after the admission to the ICU. The main outcome was survival status on day 28 after admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Most common sites of infection were intra-abdominal and respiratory system (77 and 38 cases, respectively). Median SAPS II score on admission was 47 points (25th-75th quartiles range, 37-57 points). Twenty eight days survival rate was 41%. The best discrimination results were shown for cumulative scores with the highest for the SOFA score on day 3 in the ICU. The ability to discriminate outcome on day 1 was weak for the presence of dysfunction in all organ systems except neurological. The discriminative power of organ dysfunction scores increased during the stay in the ICU. Neurological and cardiovascular dysfunctions were the independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The SOFA scores showed high accuracy in describing the course of organ dysfunction for the patients with severe sepsis. Evolving organ dysfunction following admission to the ICU strongly affected the outcome. Cumulative SOFA scores were better in discriminating outcome compared to single organ dysfunction scores."
19965718,Therapeutic silencing of microRNA-122 in primates with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,2010,"The liver-expressed microRNA-122 (miR-122) is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA accumulation in cultured liver cells, but its potential as a target for antiviral intervention has not been assessed. We found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide (SPC3649) complementary to miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals. Furthermore, transcriptome and histological analyses of liver biopsies demonstrated derepression of target mRNAs with miR-122 seed sites, down-regulation of interferon-regulated genes, and improvement of HCV-induced liver pathology. The prolonged virological response to SPC3649 treatment without HCV rebound holds promise of a new antiviral therapy with a high barrier to resistance."
31885296,TREC and KREC in very preterm infants: reference values and effects of maternal and neonatal factors.,2021,"OBJECTIVE: T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC) assays have been used for severe combined immunodeficiencies newborn screening (NBS). We assessed TREC and KREC NBS values in preterm infants and investigated if perinatal characteristics affect their values. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study collecting data from TREC and KREC NBS database and from mothers' and infants' medical charts. RESULTS: TREC and KREC values were lower in preterm infants born at 23-31 or 32-36 weeks of gestation than in term infants. Gestational age <28 weeks of gestation, leukopenia, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy lowered TREC. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy lowered KREC and intrapartum fever >38  degrees C increased it. Low TREC and KREC values were not associated to the risk of developing early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis. CONCLUSION: TREC and KREC levels are lower in preterm than term infants, but this did not increase the risk of neonatal sepsis."
33390742,Newborn with bilateral congenital cataracts: Never forget congenital rubella syndrome.,2020,"A term, growth-restricted newborn presented with a sepsis-like picture, persistent pulmonary hypertension and bilateral cataracts. Initial review of prenatal and family history, as well as microbiological investigations were noncontributory. Following lenticular extraction, viral examination of the lenses confirmed the presence of rubella. Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) presents with a constellation of signs and symptoms that overlap with many other conditions. The presence of bilateral cataracts in a newborn is a rare finding and this case is used to review the broad etiology of congenital cataracts. We propose a structured diagnostic approach for clinicians, remembering that CRS is a rare but possible etiology. The early diagnosis of CRS in this case, allowed us to initiate appropriate management and preventive measurements."
15729209,Clinical applications of B-type natriuretic peptide levels in the care of cardiovascular patients.,2004,"B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is a cardiac neurohormone, and is released as prepro BNP and then enzymatically cleaved to the N-terminal-proBNP and BNP upon ventricular myocyte stretch. Blood measurements of BNP have been used to identify patients with heart failure (HF). The BNP assay is currently used in diagnosis, prognosis, screening, and response to treatment for patients with HF. In general, a BNP level below 100 pg/mL excludes acutely decompensated HF and levels > 500 pg/ml indicate decompensation. There are supportive data for using BNP to guide both inpatient and outpatient HF diagnosis and treatment. When BNP is elevated in acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis, it implies that subclinical left ventricular dysfunction is present and a higher mortality rate can be expected. Elevated BNP levels before cardiac surgery are associated with higher rates of atrial fibrillation and death. After bypass surgery, as left ventricular function improves, the BNP level can be expected to fall. Lastly, in patients with aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation, BNP elevates and is associated or may precede the development of symptoms and possibly can serve as a trigger for additional evaluation or intervention."
20012908,Population-based study of the epidemiology and the risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Detailed population-based data on the epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections are sparse. We sought to describe the incidence rate, risk factors, and outcomes associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia in a large Canadian health region. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective population-based surveillance for P. aeruginosa bacteremia was conducted in the Calgary Health Region (CHR, population:approx. 1.2 million) during the period from 2000 to 2006. RESULTS: A total of 284 incident cases of P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified in CHR residents, corresponding to an annual incidence rate of 3.6/100,000.Nosocomial acquisition accounted for 45% of cases,healthcare-associated community onset for 34% of cases,and community-acquired (CA) cases for 21%. Relative to the general population, risk factors for blood stream infection included male sex, increasing age, hemodialysis,solid organ transplant, diagnosis of cancer, heart disease, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, and/or chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD). Overall mortality was 29%. Factors associated with mortality in univariate analysis included pulmonary focus of infection and co-morbidities, including chronic liver disease, substance abuse, heart disease, COPD, and cancer, and increased with the burden of co-morbidities. Despite those patients with CA disease having fewer co-morbidities,they had a significantly higher mortality rate than either healthcare-associated cases or nosocomial cases(RR 1.88, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that P. aeruginosa bacteremic disease is responsible for a significant burden of illness in general populations and identifies those groups at increased risk of infection and subsequent mortality. This information can be used to identify those individuals likely to benefit from empiric anti-pseudomonal therapies."
31924453,Rate Control Management of Atrial Fibrillation With Rapid Ventricular Response in the Emergency Department.,2020,"BACKGROUND: There exists limited evidence on managing atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response in the emergency department. We sought to better understand the burden of disease in patients with AF for whom rhythm control was not successful or not attempted and identify opportunities for improved care. METHODS: We conducted a health records review of consecutive visits of patients with AF at 2 academic emergency departments. We included patients >/= 18 years with AF, heart rate >/= 100 beats per minute (bpm), and who were not successfully cardioverted or not attempted cardioversion. Outcomes were: (1) incidence given rate control, (2) management practices, (3) adverse events, (4) compliance with guidelines, and (5) outcomes. We performed descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We included 665 visits, with mean age +/- standard deviation 77.4 +/- 12.9, female 51.6%, mean +/- standard deviation heart rate 121.6 +/- 17.4 bpm, AF status (permanent 53.4%; paroxysmal 29.5%; persistent 17.1%), admitted 61.4%. Of all cases, 147 (22.1%) had primary AF and 518 (77.9%) had a rapid rate secondary to a medical cause (heart failure 12.8%; pneumonia 11.7%; sepsis 8.4%). In 117 with primary AF given rate control, 59.0% had a final rate </= 100 bpm and 7.7% suffered adverse events. Suboptimal use of rate control occurred in 47.0% (agent 2.6%; route 27.4%; dosage 9.4%; timing 7.7%). At discharge, 11.5% with CHADS-65 risk factors were still not anticoagulated. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had a rapid rhythm secondary to a medical cause. There were a concerning number of adverse events related to suboptimal use of rate control. Better awareness of guidelines will ensure safer use of rate control."
20030267,[Clinical and laboratory indicators of systemic inflammation and endotoxicosis in the evaluation of the activity of an infectious process].,2009,"Patients with chronic brucellosis underwent a complex clinical and laboratory studies to determine the indicators reflecting the degree of systemic inflammation and endotoxicosis. On the basis of an analysis of the findings, an integral quantitative approach was applied to describing the associations between various pathophysiological processes and clinical manifestations; criteria for the activity of the infectious process were objectivized, and the form of chronic brucellosis was defined. The mathematical simulation method was shown to be an adequate tool to objectivized the differential diagnosis of the clinical forms of the disease."
19945802,Acute subepicardial infarction associated with severe septic shock--insight in myocardial perfusion.,2010,"Isolated infarctions of the subepicardial myocardium without changes in subendocardium are extremely rare. We present an autoptic case with an acute subepicardial infarction of the right- and left-ventricular myocardium. A 53-year-old male was admitted to hospital with acute upper abdominal pain. Clinical examination revealed an acute infero-lateral myocardial infarction. The patient succumbed to acute heart failure a few hours later. Autopsy revealed numerous pulmonary abscesses due to suppurative lobular pneumonia with consecutive pericardial effusion. Furthermore, we diagnosed an acute myocardial infarct encompassing the entire right and left ventricles but limited to the subepicardial myocardium only. Microscopically, we observed fibrin microemboli in the subepicardial microvessels. The existence of an isolated subepicardial myocardial infarct challenges our understanding of myocardial perfusion."
41636183,Clinical significance of human herpesvirus 6 detected in cerebrospinal fluid: a 10-year retrospective study in children.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is occasionally detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of young children, but its clinical significance remains uncertain. This study aimed to describe HHV-6-positive cases and to explore features that may help distinguish presumed infection from bystander detection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with CSF HHV-6 detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction or the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (FA-ME) panel between January 2015 and March 2025 at a single tertiary hospital. Cases were categorized as presumed HHV-6 infection or bystander detection based on clinical features and the presence of alternative pathogens or diagnoses. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among 1,865 children tested, HHV-6 was detected in 25 (1.3%; median age, 6 months), all of whom presented with fever. Seizures occurred in seven (28%) and ataxia in one (4%). Two patients developed encephalitis; one had abnormal imaging and later developed epilepsy. Seventeen patients were classified as presumed infection. In this group, rash was more prevalent (59% vs. 13%, p = 0.04), neutrophil and platelet counts were lower at admission and declined further at follow-up (p < 0.05), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were higher (p < 0.01) than those in the bystander infection group. CSF pleocytosis did not differ significantly between groups. Two patients received ganciclovir; both had HHV-6 detected early by the FA-ME panel, and one was subsequently diagnosed with bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: HHV-6 encephalitis was uncommon. Rash, changes in neutrophil and platelet counts, along with elevated AST levels may help interpret CSF HHV-6 detection, but these findings require validation in larger studies incorporating virologic confirmation."
41461844,Elevated lactate-to-albumin ratio predicts short- and long-term mortality in trauma and surgical intensive care patients: a retrospective MIMIC-IV cohort study.,2025,"The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR), as a composite biomarker of integrated metabolic stress and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated prognostic utility in critical illnesses like sepsis and acute pancreatitis. However, its role in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (SICU/TSICU) patients remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between LAR and mortality in SICU/TSICU patients. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database. Adult SICU/TSICU patients with lactate and albumin measurements within 24 h of admission were included. Exclusion criteria were: repeat ICU admissions, ICU stay < 24 h, and missing lactate or albumin data. Ultimately, 2,665 patients were categorized into quartiles based on LAR. Multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and Kaplan-Meier analyses were employed to evaluate the relationship between LAR and 28-day and 365-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed interactions and robustness. The 28-day mortality and 365-day mortality rates reached 17.94% and 31.26%, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that elevated LAR independently predicted higher mortality risks (adjusted HR = 1.26, 95% CI:1.19-1.33 for 28-day; HR = 1.20, 95% CI:1.14-1.26 for 365-day), with a dose-response relationship across quartiles (P for trend < 0.001). RCS analysis showed a nonlinear association between LAR and 28-day mortality (P for nonlinear = 0.032). The 365-day RCS analysis demonstrated a significant overall positive association between LAR and mortality risk (P for overall < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency and robustness. Elevated LAR shows significant association with both short- and long-term mortality in SICU/TSICU patients, suggesting potential utility as a complementary prognostic tool. Further validation is warranted before clinical implementation."
15931333,Rapid molecular diagnosis of lactobacillus bacteremia by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: Bacteremia due to lactobacilli is uncommon, yet it is increasing in frequency, especially among immunosuppressed patients. In the clinical laboratory, lactobacilli must be subcultured from positive blood cultures before identification by traditional biochemical methods. Delays in diagnosis are significant because the organisms are inherently resistant to vancomycin, a drug frequently prescribed for empiric therapy for gram-positive bacteremia. Recently, we developed a rapid terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) diagnostic assay based on species-specific variations in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We sought to apply this technique to the identification of Lactobacillus spp. from three cases of bacteremia. DESIGN: The results of the T-RFLP analysis are compared with two standard biochemical identification methods. METHODS: Lactobacillus strains were isolated from positive clinical blood cultures. Initial suspect cultures were subcultured and characterized using an automated substrate hydrolysis system and Lactobacillus carbohydrate fermentation profiles. Further biochemical and molecular analyses were performed from isolates propagated in Lactobacillus MRS broth. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene sequenced. Two sets of fluorescent labeled primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with chromosomal preparations from reference strains and blood isolates. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and terminal-restriction fragment profile analysis performed. RESULTS: T-RFLP analysis correctly identified the Lactobacillus species in each case. T-RFLP analysis could be completed within 8 hours of obtaining a positive blood culture as compared to more than the 24 to 48 hours required for traditional culturing and biochemical characterizations. CONCLUSION: T-RFLP analysis allows for rapid identification of Lactobacillus directly from positive blood cultures and circumvents the requirement for subculture. Reduced diagnostic time has implications for duration of infection, the cost of patient care, length of hospitalization, development of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance, and mortality due to bacteremia. T-RFLP profiling represents a highly reproducible and predictive source for identification of many organisms associated with bacteremia."
31824789,Inter-rater Reliability of the Ramsay Sedation Scale for Critically-ill Intubated Patients.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Titratable palliative sedation (TPS) is frequently applied in sedative therapeutics to ameliorate unendurable and refractory distress via reduction in patient consciousness. TPS may be adjusted based on objective and subjective data: vitals, labs, Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Inappropriate dosing, including over-sedation from variability in clinician assessment of sedation scales, can contribute to significant negative clinical outcomes. We evaluated inter-rater reliability (IRR) and its relationship to variations in dosing to determine whether additional training in sedation scale assessment is necessary at our community institution. METHODS: This was a prospective study assessing sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated patients without neurogenic abnormalities. Non-nursing healthcare personnel conducted independent sedation assessments using the RSS and compared their evaluations to those documented by the nursing staff. Data obtained from the patients' chart included: demographics, Ramsay Score, past medical history, diagnosis, and body mass index (BMI). Post-analysis, non-nursing healthcare personnel scores were classified into three categories: equal to, higher than, or lower than those charted by nursing staff. RESULTS: There were 83 random RSS assessments conducted in 44 patients with a mean age of 63.6 +/10.09 years (range: 38-82) and a mean BMI of 31.2 +/12.4 (range: 15-77). 19/42 (45%) patients had a diagnosis of respiratory failure or pneumonia. Other diagnoses included congestive heart failure (3), seizures (5), aortic valve replacement (1), small bowel obstruction (1), drug overdose (2), cardiac arrest (2), and urinary tract infection (1), ST-elevated myocardial infarction (2), pulmonary embolism (2), coronary artery bypass graft (1), sepsis (1), hemoptysis (1), altered mental status (1). Non-nursing healthcare professionals' assessments were compared to nurses' and observed to be equal in 29%, higher in 59%, and lower in 12% of the cases. Of the 83 assessments, the average RSS score non-nursing healthcare professionals assigned was 4.8 +/1.6 while the nurses' charted average was3.39 +/- 0.97; a mean difference of 1.45, 95% CI (1.04 - 1.85)p< 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated equal RSS ratings in only 29% of cases for non-nursing healthcare personnel and nurses' evaluations. Without proper education, the RSS may not be a reliable tool for sedation assessments and may result in over-sedation of critically ill patients. Recurrent nursing education is warranted to ensure proper use and optimization of the RSS."
19940660,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and cerebral vasculopathy associated with influenza A infection: report of a case and review of the literature.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Influenza A infection can precipitate encephalopathy, encephalitis, or Reye syndrome with the development of cerebral edema in children and is associated with an increased incidence of stroke in adults. The mechanism of these events is poorly understood. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is seen in association with infection/sepsis, and cerebral vasculopathy has been demonstrated in PRES. We describe a case of PRES that develops in association with influenza A. SUMMARY OF CASE: A normotensive 65-year-old woman presented with altered mentation and nausea in the setting of a viral prodromal illness ultimately confirmed as influenza A. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed on the second day after admission. Catheter cerebral angiogram documented vasculopathy in PRES-involved regions with areas of focal vessel dilatation and string-of-bead appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The association between influenza A and PRES with documentation of cerebral vasculopathy suggests a common systemic vascular mechanism behind PRES and influenza-related encephalopathic edema and stroke."
25619349,[Central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference in critically ill pediatric patients with septic shock].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference [ P( cv-a) CO(2)] in evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in children with septic shock who already had central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) higher than 70% after early resuscitation. METHOD: In this prospective study, 48 septic shock children seen in Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University were enrolled from Jun 2012 to May 2014. 36(75.0%) were male, 12 (25.0%) were female, the average age was (31.9 +/- 24.5) months. The critically ill patients with septic shock were treated to achieve ScvO(2)greater than 70% depending on early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). All patients were divided into two groups, based on P(cv-a)CO(2), low P(cv-a)CO(2)group with P(cv-a)CO(2)< 6 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) and high P(cv-a)CO(2)group with P(cv-a)CO(2)>/= 6 mmHg. The parameters of hemodynamics including mean blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), perfusion-related parameters [ScvO(2), P(cv-a)CO(2), serum lactate (Lac), Lac clearance rate], pediatric critical illness score, PRISMIII score, and 28 days in-hospital mortality were recorded for all patients. RESULT: Of the 48 cases with septic shock whose ScvO(2)was higher than 70%, 17 patients (35.4%) had high P(cv-a)CO(2)( >/= 6 mmHg) and 31 (65.6%) had lower P(cv-a)CO(2)(<6 mmHg). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups of patients in age, PRISMIII score and PCIS (P > 0.05 ), but Lac and P(cv-a)CO(2)values were significantly different ( P < 0.05). Low P(cv-a) CO(2)group patients had lower 28 days mortality than high P(cv-a) CO(2)group[11/17 vs. 32.3% (10/31), P < 0.05]; 24 h after resuscitation, compared with high P(cv-a) CO(2)group, low P(cv-a) CO(2)group patients had lower Lac values [(2.0 +/- 1.3) vs.( 2.7 +/- 1.2) mmol/L, P < 0.05]. Low P(cv-a) CO(2)group patients had shorter duration of vasoactive drugs use [(16 +/- 14) vs. (44 +/- 21)h, P < 0.05], 24 h Lac clearance rate was significantly higher for low P(cv-a) CO(2)group than for high P(cv-a) CO(2)group[ (31 +/- 10) % vs. (26 +/- 6)%, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: When ScvO(2)> 70% was achieved after early resuscitation in septic shock children, P(cv-a) CO(2)is a sensitive biomarker to assess tissue perfusion, and high P(cv-a) CO(2)group patients had poor outcome."
25675360,Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis!,2014,"The early detection and treatment of sepsis are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with this condition. However, many patients admitted to hospital experience a long delay in the diagnosis of sepsis. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for febrile patients to be sent home from the Emergency Department or the physician's office with the diagnosis of 'flu' only to return hours or days later in overt septic shock. The early diagnosis of sepsis may be challenging as many of the signs and symptoms are non-specific. Clinical studies suggest that early diagnosis of sepsis requires a high index of suspicion and comprehensive clinical evaluation together with laboratory tests, including a complete blood count with differential, lactate and procalcitonin levels."
31889538,Monitoring of CMV-Specific Cell-Mediated Immunity in Kidney Transplant Recipients With a High Risk of CMV Disease (D+/R-): A Case Series.,2020,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral pathogen in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), and CMV disease impacts patient and graft survivals. CMV-specific CD8 T cell mediated-immunity (CMI) may help to assess the risk of CMV disease and to adapt preventive treatment strategies. High-risk KTRs with CMV seropositive donors/seronegative recipients (D+/R-) were prospectively monitored after CMV prophylaxis discontinuation and during the first year post transplant for CMV viremia (World Health Organization standardization) and CMI (QuantiFERON-CMV). We analyzed the ability of CMI test to predict either subsequent spontaneous viral clearance or CMV disease after prophylaxis discontinuation in patients with asymptomatic viremia. We enrolled 12 consecutive (D+/R-) KTRs. Eleven patients developed a viremia during follow-up, but 7 of them (64%) exhibited a spontaneous viral clearance. At viremia onset, 6 of 11 patients (55%) had a positive CMI test, and all of them (6 of 6, 100%) had subsequent spontaneous viral clearance, compared with only 1 of 5 patients (20%) displaying a nonreactive CMI (P = .02). This latter patient exhibited a positive CMI test 15 days after viremia onset. Four of the 11 patients (36%) developed a CMV disease, and their CMI either remained nonreactive or became positive only after antiviral treatment. We conclude that D+/R- KTRs with asymptomatic viremia after prophylaxis discontinuation may benefit from QuantiFERON-CMV to predict when positive for the spontaneous viral clearance or when persistently negative or the development of a CMV disease."
25697617,[Inferior vena cava thrombosis and endocarditis in a premature patient: case report].,2014,"Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava represents a significant percentage of all venous thrombosis that take place during the neonatal period, generally associated with risk factors such as the use of central venous catheter. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis in preterm infants is low. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the case of a preterm neonate with both conditions and to detail the disease changing spectrum in the neonatal population and its therapeutic possibilities. CASE REPORT: Premature newborn, 31 + 5 weeks of gestation who presented Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia, developed progressive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and right atrium secondary to the use of umbilical venous catheter, with subsequent diagnosis of endocarditis. He was treated with anticoagulation with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Given a favorable evolution, it was decided to continue the anticoagulation therapy for 4-6 weeks, and at the time of discharge, aspirin treatment was given. CONCLUSIONS: The preterm infant with infective endocarditis and intracardiac thrombus presents an interesting management dilemma. Treatment should be individualized according to the clinical evolution and safety profile of thrombolytic and/or anticoagulant agents. Availability and advantages of low molecular weight heparin have led to its use as an alternative treatment in neonates and infants with deep venous thrombosis."
19996142,In vitro activity of antifungal combinations against Candida albicans biofilms.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro activity and synergism of the combinations of amphotericin B/caspofungin and amphotericin B/posaconazole against Candida albicans, grown either as planktonic cells or in biofilms. METHODS: Ten C. albicans bloodstream isolates used in this study were collected from intensive care patients admitted to the Vienna University Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Chequerboard tests were employed to determine the efficacy of the antifungal combinations amphotericin B/caspofungin and amphotericin B/posaconazole against both planktonic cells and biofilms. C. albicans biofilms were prepared using the static microtitre plate model. The activity of antifungal combination therapy was determined by visual reading for planktonic cells and using the XTT assay for biofilms. RESULTS: For Candida biofilms the median MIC was 4 mg/L for amphotericin B and caspofungin, and >256 mg/L for posaconazole. The combination amphotericin B/posaconazole yielded synergism [fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) <0.26], whereas amphotericin B/caspofungin yielded indifferent interaction only (FICI 0.75-1.25) against all isolates when grown in biofilms. Under planktonic conditions, synergism was demonstrable for the combination amphotericin B/caspofungin against 4 of the 10 isolates, whereas the combination of caspofungin/posaconazole was indifferent against all tested isolates. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that MICs for planktonic and biofilm forms of C. albicans were much lower when treated with an antifungal combination than when treated with single agents. The combination of amphotericin B/posaconazole yielded synergism against Candida biofilms, whereas amphotericin B/caspofungin yielded indifferent interaction."
25502811,Patients infected with CRF07_BC have significantly lower viral loads than patients with HIV-1 subtype B: mechanism and impact on disease progression.,2014,"The circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC is the most prevalent HIV-1 strain among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan. It contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in its p6gag. We conducted a cohort study to compare viral loads and CD4 cell count changes between patients infected with subtype B and CRF07_BC and to elucidate its mechanism. Twenty-one patients infected with CRF07_BC and 59 patients with subtype B were selected from a cohort of 667 HIV-1/AIDS patients whom have been followed up for 3 years. Generalized estimated equation was used to analyze their clinical data and the results showed that patients infected with CRF07_BC had significantly lower viral loads (about 58,000 copies per ml less) than patients with subtype B infection (p = 0.002). The replicative capacity of nine CRF07_BC and four subtype B isolates were compared and the results showed that the former had significantly lower replicative capacity than the latter although all of them were CCR5- tropic and non-syncytium inducing viruses. An HIV-1-NL4-3 mutant virus which contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in p6gag (designated as 7d virus) was generated and its live cycle was investigated. The results showed that 7d virus had significantly lower replication capacity, poorer protease-mediated processing and viral proteins production. Electron microscopic examination of cells infected with wild-type or 7d virus demonstrated that the 7d virus had poorer and slower viral maturation processes: more viruses attached to the cell membrane and higher proportion of immature virions outside the cells. The interaction between p6gag and Alix protein was less efficient in cells infected with 7d virus. In conclusion, patients infected with CRF07_BC had significantly lower viral loads than patients infected with subtype B and it may due to the deletion of 7 amino acids which overlaps with Alix protein-binding domain of the p6gag."
41398891,Reevaluating the obesity paradox across diverse disease outcomes: A Mendelian randomization study.,2025,"The ""obesity paradox"" suggests a protective effect of obesity on certain diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, but results remain inconsistent, largely due to reliance on body mass index (BMI) alone. To clarify this, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causal effects of multiple obesity-related anthropometric traits on key clinical outcomes. We conducted MR analyses using summary statistics from genome-wide association study to investigate the causal effects of 13 obesity-related anthropometric indicators-including BMI, basal metabolic rate (BMR), hip circumference, waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BFP), arm fat mass (AFM), leg fat mass (LFM), trunk fat mass (TFM), trunk fat free mass (TFFM), whole body fat mass, whole body fat free mass (WBFFM), whole body water mass (WBWM), trunk predicted mass (TPM)-on 5 major clinical outcomes: diffuse large B cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, pathological fracture in patient with osteoporosis, sepsis, and 28-day mortality due to sepsis. We selected these outcomes because they represent distinct but obesity-relevant disease categories, encompassing cancer, metabolic-skeletal complications, infection, and mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses, included tests for heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy, were performed to assess the stability of MR results. MR analyses revealed no evidence supporting the obesity paradox but demonstrated causal associations between obesity-related traits and clinical outcomes. After excluding traits with horizontal pleiotropy, results showed: BMR, TFFM, and TPM increased diffuse large B cell lymphoma risk; BMI, BMR, AFM, LFM, TFFM, WBFFM, and TPM increased pancreatic cancer risk; BMR, TFFM, WBFFM, WBWM, and TPM increased pathological fracture risk in osteoporosis; BMI, BMR, WC, BFP, AFM, LFM, TFM, whole body fat mass and WBWM increased sepsis risk; and BMI, hip circumference, WC, BFP, AFM, LFM, and TFM increased 28-day sepsis mortality risk (all P < .05). This MR study found no evidence of an ""obesity paradox"" for the specific outcomes evaluated. Instead, our findings demonstrated that elevated levels of obesity-related anthropometric traits are causally associated with increased risks of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, pathological fractures in osteoporosis, sepsis, and sepsis-related 28-day mortality. These results provide important insights into the pathogenic role of obesity and may inform future strategies for obesity-related disease prevention and risk assessment."
41480135,Statistical Study for the Prognostic Value of NLR Values in Patients with Severe Burns: A Study in the Service of Burns in Albania.,2025,"The phases of burn care include initial resuscitation, definitive wound management, and rehabilitation of physical and psychological injuries. In severe burns, this response lasts for the first two to three days post-burn and burns larger than 15% of total body surface area lead to the initiation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory biomarker that can indicate systemic inflammation. NLR is defined by the absolute number of neutrophils divided by the absolute number of lymphocytes. Many studies have been done in severe burn patients because they reflect changes in the systemic inflammatory response. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NLR values in patients with severe burns and provide clinical guidance for sepsis and mortality. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Service of Burns of the University Hospital Centre ""Mother Teresa"" in Tirana (UHCT), Albania. We compared NLR levels in burn patients with sepsis and without sepsis. Our data showed a significantly higher level of NLR in burn patients with sepsis, while the values of NLR on the 3rd day (NLR 3) have statistical significance (p<0.0001). From the logistic regression analysis, we found that only NLR 3 can predict mortality, whose cut-off (4.59) was determined with the help of ROC curve analysis and was accurately presented with the help of Kaplan-Meier curves with statistical significance. From multiple regression, we understand that mortality can be predicted based on TBSA%, age, presence of inhalatory burn, and NLR 3 together."

When associated with gastrointestinal tract or central nervous system involvment, patients with Degos disease have a poor prognosis and a high mortality. We report a case of Degos disease with systemic involvement, which ultimately caused peritonitis, sepsis, and death, despite all treatment. A 29-year-old man was admitted in June 2007 on the surgical ward of our hospital with acute generalized abdominal pain and multiple skin lesions. The patient had an appendectomy at another hospital 6 weeks before the current presentation. The exploratory laparotomy showed 2 perforations of the ileum. After the initial procedure, the patient developed spontaneous recurrent perforations of the small bowel and suffered another 3 reoperations. Neuroradiologic reports described central and peripheral nervous system involvement with progressive clinical deterioration and a meningovascular pattern at cerebral MRI. Despite aggressive treatment the patient died 3 months after the first surgical intervention."
41598217,Peak Lactate Within 24 h and Mortality in Septic Shock Patients Receiving Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Real-World Cohort from an Asian ICU (2018-2020).,2025,"BACKGROUND: Serum lactate is a key biomarker of tissue hypoperfusion and metabolic stress in sepsis. Although lactate clearance is widely recognized, many intensive care units record only a peak lactate within 24 h (pLac-24h). The prognostic value of pLac-24h among patients receiving blood purification therapy remains unclear in Asian intensive care settings. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 2018-2020 ICU dataset from MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Among 16,693 adult ICU admissions, 2506 patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as blood purification for severe sepsis or septic shock. Of these, 1264 (50.4%) had available pLac-24h data, and 27 (1.1%) also required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, APACHE II score, infection source, and CRRT/ECMO use. Discrimination was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision-curve analysis. This analysis was conducted as a predefined sub-analysis of an institutional ICU database. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 65.7 +/- 13.4 years, and 64.8% were male. Median pLac-24h was 5.1 mmol/L (IQR 3.2-8.6). The overall 28-day mortality among CRRT patients was 47.3%. Mortality rose progressively across pLac-24h quartiles (Q1-Q4: 28.9%, 39.4%, 54.7%, and 68.1%; p < 0.001). Each 1 mmol/L increase in pLac-24h independently predicted higher mortality (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.26, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for pLac-24h predicting 28-day mortality was 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), outperforming the APACHE II score (AUC 0.69, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with septic shock undergoing CRRT, peak lactate within 24 h was a strong, independent predictor of 28-day mortality. pLac-24h offers a pragmatic, readily available prognostic indicator when serial lactate measurements are unavailable, supporting its integration into bedside risk assessment in real-world Asian ICU practice."
20015319,Evaluation of anti-activated protein C antibody development in patients with severe sepsis from four clinical studies with drotrecogin alpha (activated).,2009,"BACKGROUND: Drotrecogin alpha (activated) (DAA) is a recombinant human activated protein C (APC), which is an antithrombotic protein. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the development of anti-APC antibodies in severe sepsis patients in DAA clinical studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum and plasma samples were collected in placebo-controlled studies (PROWESS, ADDRESS) and studies where all patients were DAA-treated (ENHANCE, XPRESS). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting anti-APC IgA/IgG/IgM antibodies was used. IgG isolated from plasma of positive samples was tested for neutralizing activity against DAA-induced prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time. RESULTS: The proportions of patients with negative baseline but positive postbaseline anti-APC antibodies were 1.5% (27/1855) and 1.6% (24/1493) in the DAA and placebo cohorts, respectively (P = 0.72 for the difference). Of the 27 DAA and 24 placebo patients with positive anti-APC antibodies, all but one (DAA) were alive at day 28, and all but seven (four DAA and three placebo) were alive at hospital discharge, including eight (five DAA and three placebo) patients who tested positive for anti-APC neutralizing antibodies. Two of the 51 patients who tested positive for the development of anti-APC antibodies experienced a thrombotic event (one DAA, one placebo). In ADDRESS, no anti-APC antibody was detected in the six DAA-treated patients who had received a previous course of DAA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with anti-APC antibodies was low and was similar between DAA-treated and placebo-treated patients. No relationship between anti-APC antibody development and adverse reactions was observed. There was no evidence that the anti-APC antibodies detected represented a specific immune response to DAA therapy."
41421980,Leveraging laboratory biomarkers to predict urosepsis after upper urinary tract stone surgery: an explainable machine learning approach.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Urosepsis is a leading cause of perioperative mortality after upper urinary tract stone surgery. This study aimed to develop a simple and accurate predictive model for postoperative sepsis by integrating laboratory parameters using machine learning (ML) and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm. METHODS: Data from 7,464 patients were analyzed, including 155 pre- and postoperative features. Key variables were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and correlation analysis. Eight ML algorithms were employed to develop the predictive model using 10-fold cross-validation. The model's performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. The SHAP algorithm was employed to analyze variable importance. Finally, the model was converted into a publicly accessible application. RESULTS: 116 out of 155 variables (74.84%) differed significantly between the urosepsis (n = 622, 8.33%) and non-urosepsis groups (n = 6,842, 91.67%). LASSO regression identified eight predictive variables: postoperative IL-6, SAA, PCT/ALB, NLPR, PT, ALB, HCT, and neutrophil. Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 1.0, 0.90, and 0.88 for the training, validation, and test cohorts, respectively. A good model fit, strong calibration, and positive clinical utility were confirmed by the learning curve, calibration plot, and decision curve. Postoperative PCT/ALB, neutrophil, IL-6, ALB, and PT were identified as key predictors by the SHAP algorithm. A publicly accessible web application was developed to facilitate both patients and physicians (https://www.xsmartanalysis.com/model/list/predict/model/html?mid=29648&symbol=71lphm763138mj895nd8). CONCLUSIONS: A robust, interpretable model based on postoperative laboratory biomarkers was successfully developed and validated. This model exhibits excellent predictive performance and clinical utility, and the integration of SHAP analysis provides transparent insights into the key drivers of urosepsis, offering a practical tool for early risk stratification and personalized intervention in clinical practice.

32010651,Neonatal Acute Kidney Injury: A Survey of Perceptions and Management Strategies Amongst Pediatricians and Neonatologists.,2019,"Background: Neonatal Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurs in 40-70% of critically ill newborn infants and is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Understanding the practice patterns of physicians (neonatologists and pediatricians), caring for neonates in India is important to optimize care and outcomes in neonatal AKI. Aim: The aim of this study was to identify differences in physician's perception and practice variations of diagnosis, management, and follow-up of newborn infants with AKI in India. Methods: An online survey of neonatologists and pediatricians in India caring for newborn infants with AKI. Results: Out of 800 correspondents, 257 (135 neonatologists and 122 pediatricians) completed the survey, response rate being 32.1%. Resources available to the respondents included level III NICU (59%), neonatal surgery (60%), dialysis (11%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3%). Most respondents underestimated the risk of AKI due to various risk factors such as prematurity, asphyxia, sepsis, cardiac surgery, and medications. Less than half the respondents were aware of the AKIN or KDIGO criteria, which are the current standard criteria for defining neonatal AKI. Only half of the respondents were aware of the risk of CKD in preterm neonates and nearly half were unaware of the need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist. Conclusions: Similar to other regions worldwide, there exists a knowledge gap in early recognition, optimal management and follow up of newborn infants with AKI amongst Indian physicians."
41469732,Improving blood culture procurement: a prospective 5-year hospital-wide study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Appropriate procurement of blood cultures (BC) is essential for diagnosis of bacteremia and susceptibility testing. This includes (1) adequate preparation of the venipuncture site to minimize contamination; (2) obtaining >/= two sets with a time interval before starting antibiotics. Although these recommendations are standard since the 1960s, adherence is far less than expected - which may adversely impact on the management of bacteremic patients. AIMS OF STUDY: This single-center study conducted in Shaare Zedek Medical Center aimed to decrease the proportion of contaminated BCs and to increase the percentage of obtaining two sets of BC/ blood-culture-taking episode. METHODS: Determination of both markers at baseline, then monthly for one year, then subsequently on a quarterly basis; showing data from all departments in real-time to all department directors; and providing short educative lectures during departmental staff meetings, at baseline and after 1-2 years. These markers were adopted as one of the hospital-wide quality measures. RESULTS: In the 20-year period 2000-2019 more than 1 million BCs were obtained, of which 70% were from patients </= 72 h in hospital. During the 5-year study (2020-2024), the percent of blood-culture-taking episodes from which two culture sets were obtained increased annually by +/- 16% from a baseline of 27% (9010/33306) in 2020, to 46% (18462/40191) in 2024 (Incidence Rate Ratios, IRR 1.16 [95%CI 1.13-1.18], p < 0.001). This improvement was observed in almost all departments and was especially profound in the emergency department (ED), starting at a baseline of 19% (1979/10326) and increasing to 53% (5304/9915)(IRR 1.33 [95%CI 1.27-1.39], p < 0.001). During the same period, the annual proportion of false-positive BCs, from which only contaminants were isolated, decreased annually by 18% from 2.4% (1592/65230) in 2020 to 1.3% (895/68991) in 2024 (IRR 0.82 [95%CI 0.77-0.88], p < 0.001). This improvement was observed in all departments: in the emergency department, this rate decreased from 3.3% (676/20529) to 1.56% (272/17459) (IRR 0.79 [95%CI 0.75-0.83], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A simple educational intervention, combined with meticulous data mining and presentation of each department's results, with comparison of all other departments, led to significant and sustained improvement in measurable markers."
20009144,Late acute celiac and hepatic artery thrombosis with portal vein thrombosis resulting in hepatic infarction 12 years post orthotopic liver transplantation.,2009,"Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is relatively infrequent, but possibly a devastating complication of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). It often requires urgent retransplantation. Two main forms of HAT are recognized as early and late HAT (diagnosis within or after 30 days following LT). Early HAT typically results in graft failure. Late HAT features biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and hepatic abscess formation. We report here the case of a patient of Wilson's disease who presented twelve years post-liver transplant symptoms typical of acute HAT and hepatic infarction. On diagnostic imaging, celiac axis and hepatic artery were thrombosed, resulting in ischemic necrosis of the left hepatic lobe. The resulting sepsis and transient hepatic insufficiency were managed conservatively, and repeat OLT was avoided. The patient remains stable more than one year later. To the best of our knowledge this case report is unique in the literature for the unusually long interval between OLT and late acute HAT, as well as celiac and portal vein occlusion. The acute presentation of sub massive hepatic necrosis is also uncharacteristic of late HAT and more typical of acute HAT. This report describes our experience in managing this and a literature review of the topic."

41601683,A critically ill adolescent with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-induced hyperinflammatory shock: a case report and literature review.,2025,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can trigger life-threatening complications, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and septic shock. The overlapping clinical manifestations of these conditions pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article reports the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old female who presented with persistent high fever (40.1 degrees C), tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, along with markedly elevated inflammatory markers, meeting the diagnostic criteria for septic shock. Laboratory investigations revealed rapid, significant decreases in white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet count. A positive serum EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM test led to a suspicion of EBV-associated HLH (EBV-HLH). Prior to a definitive diagnosis of EBV-HLH, the patient was initiated on early and adequate combination therapy with corticosteroids and antivirals. This intervention resulted in rapid clinical and laboratory improvement: body temperature normalized by day 3, and peripheral blood counts gradually returned to normal. The subsequent bone marrow aspiration confirmed the HLH diagnosis, supported by elevated serum ferritin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) levels, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for HLH. The patient was discharged on a tapering regimen of oral methylprednisolone and achieved complete recovery without relapse during follow-up. This case suggests that rapidly progressive and significant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are key early indicators for distinguishing EBV-HLH from sepsis alone. Early recognition of EBV-HLH and timely initiation of combined corticosteroid and antiviral therapy can effectively control cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes in patients with favorable treatment responses, providing valuable clinical insights for managing similar severe cases."
41399017,Diagnostic Accuracy of Shotgun Metagenomics for Bloodstream Infections Is Influenced by Bioinformatics Workflow Selection.,2025,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a severe and often fatal condition, and a major cause of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies due to underlying conditions and anticancer therapy-induced immunodeficiency. Rapid identification of the causative pathogens is essential as BSI results in worsened prognosis, extended hospitalization, delays or dose reductions in therapy, and may progress to sepsis and septic shock if untreated. Shotgun metagenomics is a culture-independent technique capable of detecting a wide range of fungal, viral, and bacterial organisms along with their antimicrobial resistance genes. Several studies showed that shotgun metagenomics enables the diagnosis of BSI, specifically in cases where conventional methods/culture-dependent techniques fail to identify the causative pathogens. However, evaluation of the accuracy of the applied bioinformatics pipelines remains incomplete. This study aimed to compare and optimize four commonly used bioinformatics pipelines (BLAST, Kraken, Metaphlan, RTG Core) for shotgun metagenomics by assessing their accuracy in identifying pathogens in blood samples from patients with hematological malignancies and suspected BSI, with blood culture serving as the reference standard. Our work shows that the selection of bioinformatics pipelines for diagnosing BSI strongly affects the precision of the findings, and an optimized BLAST pipeline was superior to the alternatives, as it was the only method that accurately identified the causative pathogens."
41614763,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Pediatric Infections: A Systematic Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are granule- and nucleus-derived structures that support innate immunity. While the contribution of NETs to adult infections and autoimmune diseases is well studied, evidence in children is still inconsistent. This review aimed to summarize current findings on NETs in pediatric infections. METHODS: This study followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in major databases (MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus) from inception until 5 September 2025. The study quality was evaluated using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review. In respiratory disease, the role of NETs was well described and their formation correlated with severity. Patients with febrile urinary tract infections showed elevated urinary NET-associated markers. In COVID-19 infection, NET levels were unchanged in uncomplicated cases but elevated in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Findings in sepsis were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents the published evidence on NET formation in the pediatric population, assessing the current knowledge and identifying the gaps to guide research. Future studies should aim to standardize NET detection methods, evaluate their prognostic value in large prospective cohorts, and explore the various NET-associated mechanisms in children."
16167756,Sickle cell disease in Uganda: a time for action.,2003,"OBJECTIVES: To draw attention to the extent of homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease as a public health problem in Uganda where a mean 20% frequency of the sickle cell trait implies that 25,000 babies with SS disease are born each year. To highlight the dangers of applying interventions developed in non-malarial areas to regions where malaria may change the natural history and outcome of sickle cell disease. DATA SOURCES: The published literature from Africa and from the US and Caribbean in populations of African ancestry. STUDY SELECTION: The world literature especially, that derived from the US, Caribbean, and equatorial Africa. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In non-malarial areas, simple interventions applied early in life have significantly improved survival and the quality of life. Two well documented interventions are pneumococcal prophylaxis and the early parental diagnosis of acute splenic sequestration. The available literature from Africa suggests that neither of these may be appropriate in malarial areas. CONCLUSIONS: Manifestations of SS disease differ in malarial areas and it is questionable whether interventions developed in non-malarial areas apply. There is an urgent need to document the causes of death so that locally appropriate interventions may be developed to improve survival. Equally urgent is the need to define the pattern of clinical problems so that models of care may be evolved for use in malarial areas. Without this knowledge, health care planners will not have the information necessary to develop strategies and limited resources may be inappropriately deployed."
15684797,Static and dynamic assessment of biomarkers in surgical patients with severe sepsis.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis, defined as a systemic inflammatory response to infection associated with acute organ dysfunction, is common among surgical patients and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Severe sepsis has been associated with changes in inflammatory and hemostatic biomarkers. In patients undergoing surgical procedures there may be additional stimulation of cytokine release and activation of the coagulation system. The purpose of this study was to characterize the baseline differences in biomarkers between surgical and non-surgical patients. In addition, we assessed the dynamic changes in biomarkers and coagulation parameters in surgical patients with severe sepsis enrolled in PROWESS and treated with placebo or drotrecogin alfa (activated). METHODS: A blinded PROWESS surgical evaluation committee (SEC) verified patients as having undergone a relevant operative procedure within 30 days of enrollment for inclusion in the surgical cohort of PROWESS. At baseline and on study days 1-7, biomarkers and coagulation parameters available for analysis were D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), protein C activity, protein S activity, anti-thrombin III (ATIII), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and prothrombin time (PT). Platelet count was determined at baseline only. Baseline values were compared between SEC-defined surgical and all other non-surgical patients, and between pre- and post-operative surgical patients from the PROWESS trial. Changes from baseline were compared between drotrecogin alfa (activated)-treated and placebo-treated surgical patients. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA on the ranked values. RESULTS: The SEC verified 474 (28%) of the 1,690 PROWESS patients as surgical. Median D-dimer, IL-6, aPTT and PT values were significantly higher at baseline for surgical patients than non-surgical patients (p < 0.001). Surgical patients had significantly lower median protein C, protein S, and ATIII activity at baseline than non-surgical patients (p < 0.001). Surgical patients treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) showed a significant decrease in D-dimer levels on study days 1-5 (p < 0.05), and a more rapid increase in Protein C levels on study days 1-4 (p < 0.05) compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients with severe sepsis appear to have a higher severity of illness at baseline as demonstrated by derangements in biomarkers and coagulation markers compared to non-surgical patients. Surgical patients treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated)showed reduced D-dimer concentrations and a more rapid increase in protein C concentrations during the infusion period."
15683032,[Clinical suspicion of vertebral osteomielitis: back pain in patients with hemodyalisis by catheter related infection].,2004,"The overall incidence of vertebral osteomyelitis is increasing due to, the increasing rates of bacteraemia due to intravascular devices. We report a patient with end-stage renal failure under hemodialysis by internal jugular catheters who started with back pain after several episodes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, and whose magnetic resonance imaging was showed signs suggestive of spondylodiscitis. Other 4 similar cases from our service have been analysed, thereby we can conclude the most effective treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis and/or epidural abscess is premature diagnosis of these pathologies. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive radiologic technique whom we have. Treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis must be preceded by a correct bacteriological diagnosis. Surgery plays a central role in the successful treatment and should be performed as soon as neurological problems are apparent."
15702912,"Usefulness of the PCR technique for bacterial DNA detection in blood of the patients after ""opened heart"" operations.",2004,"To confirm the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique (versus blood cultures) and to gain a better understanding of the incidence of true- and false-positive results when using this technique, one hundred randomly chosen patients treated operationally because of valve defects were examined. In our studies we found that PCR techniques using universal primers complementary to the bacterial 16S rDNA showed promise as being more sensitive than conventional blood culture (BC) techniques. From the time that a blood culture is positive, conventional methods of culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing require at least 64 h for the detection of infection or colonization. Rapid identification of bacteria from blood using PCR technique accelerates the microbiological diagnosis."
26078653,Late-onset Streptococcus pasteurianus sepsis in a preterm baby in a neonatal intensive care unit.,2014,"Apnea, cyanosis, lethargy and prolongation in capillary filling time developed on the postnatal 37(th) day in a preterm baby who was born at the 30(th) gestational week with a birth weight of 1 300 g. Acute phase reactants and immature/total neutrophil count ratio were found to be high. The patient who was diagnosed with sepsis was successfully treated with meropenem which was started empirically. In his blood culture Streptococcus pasteurianus grew. S. pasteurianus is in the subgroup of streptococcus bovis which is one of the D group streptococci and its previous name is S. bovis type II/2. In the literature, there are very few cases of neonatal infection related with this bacterium. As far as we know, this is first case of neonatal sepsis caused by S. pasteurianus in Turkey. In addition, we tried to determine the clinical properties of neonatal infections arising from S. pasteurianus by reviewing the literature."
25661276,Risk factors for alloimmunisation in the general patient population.,2015,"For hospitals providing services to regional populations, difficulties are associated with transferred patients with poorly communicated medical history and a risk of alloimmunisation. Identification of patients at risk would assist in treatment planning. A retrospective study of alloimmunised patients was undertaken, comparing the demographics and diagnoses of this population with a control patient population. A preponderance of diagnoses of Sepsis, Haematological Malignancy, GIT Bleeds and Renal Failure was demonstrated in the alloimmunised population. Consistent with prior studies, RhD negative patients and female patients were over-represented in the study group, which was also on average significantly older."
16088522,"Line sepsis in the ICU: prevention, diagnosis, and management.",2003,"Intravascular devices (IVDs) are universally employed in the intensive care unit. Although their use is essential for the administration of medications and IV fluids, they carry a substantial risk of infection, either from the device itself or from contamination of administered infusate. IVD-related infections lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality and excess costs, but they are preventable. The highest rates of IVD-related infection occur with central venous catheters (CVCs). Immunosuppression and other underlying illnesses further increase the risk of IVD-related infection. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp. are the most frequent infecting organisms. The incidence of IVD-related infections may be minimized by simple measures, including maximal barrier precautions during CVC placement, specialized training for personnel placing IVDs, and use of chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. Management of line sepsis should include blood cultures, treatment with appropriate antibiotics or antifungals, and, in most cases, removal and culture of the IVD."
31914681,An antimicrobial molecule mitigates signs of sepsis in vivo and eradicates infections from lung tissue.,2020,"The peptide sequence KKIRVRLSA was synthesized in a dimeric structure (SET-M33DIM) and evaluated as a candidate drug for infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens. SET-M33DIM showed significant antibacterial activity against MDR strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration [MICs], 1.5-11 microM), and less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs, 11-22 microM). It showed very low toxicity in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo; in cytotoxicity tests, its EC(50) was as much as 22 times better than that of SET-M33, a peptide with the same amino-acid sequence, but synthesized in tetra-branched form (638 vs 28 microM). In in vivo and ex vivo experiments, SET-M33DIM cleared P. aeruginosa infection, significantly reducing signs of sepsis in animals, and restoring cell viability in lung tissue after bacterial challenge. It also quelled inflammation triggered by LPS and live bacterial cells, inhibiting expression of inflammatory mediators in lung tissue, cultured macrophages, and bronchial cells from a cystic fibrosis patient."

DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study covering the period January 2000 to December 2003. SETTING: Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret. PATIENTS: Thirty six children. RESULTS: Of the 36 children, 28 (78%) were males and eight (22%) females giving a ratio of 3.5:1. Median age was six months with a range of 2-72 months. The duration of symptoms was a mean of 5 days with a range of 1-14 days. Sixty one percent were referrals. Initial diagnosis of intussusception based on signs and symptoms was made in 6 out of 36 (17%) patients. The rest were initially treated for other problems. Decision to refer to surgeons, was based on abdominal distension. Plain x-ray was done in four patients and barium enema in one patient. Seventy five percent of the patients required fluid resuscitation before operation. All patients (100%) were managed operatively. Seventy two percent had ileo-colic intussusception, 8% ile-oileal and 22% colo-colic. Perforation was found in 22% and gangrene in 31%. Sixty seven percent were successfully reduced by ""milking"" while 33% required resection and anastomosis/or stoma creation. Complications included: anastomatic breakdown, bronchopneumonial renal failure, sepsis, recurrent intussusception and death. Mortality was 14% overall. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and presentation coupled with improved peri-operative management are essential in improving outcome."
25501414,[Clofarabine-based combination chemotherapy for relapse and refractory childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia].,2014,"Clofarabine, one of the key treatment agents for refractory and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), achieves a remission rate of approximately 30% with single-agent clofarabine induction chemotherapy. However, a remission rate of approximately 50% was reported with a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. We treated two cases with refractory and relapsed ALL with combination chemotherapy including clofarabine; one was an induction failure but the other achieved remission. Both cases developed an infectious complication (NCI-CTCAE grade 3) and body pain with infusion. Prophylactic antibiotic and opioid infusions facilitated avoiding septic shock and pain. Further investigation of such cases is required."
15724119,[Tibial osteomyelitis following intraosseous infusion: a case report].,2004,"Fluids, medications, and blood products can be rapidly administered via intraosseous infusion under emergency conditions, particularly to pediatric patients aged from 0 to 2 years. A five-month-old infant who had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of sepsis developed swelling and hyperemia at the infusion site 10 days after an intraosseous infusion in the right proximal tibia. Physical examination showed a serous discharge from a fistula on the anteromedial side of the right proximal cruris. Plain radiographs demonstrated periosteal reaction in the right tibia and osteolytic areas in the proximal metaphysis. With a diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis, drainage and medullary irrigation were performed and parenteral antibiotic treatment was initiated. Cultures from the surgical site yielded Candida albicans, upon which fluconazole (8 mg/kg) treatment was administered for four weeks. A complete clinical and radiographic improvement was observed at the end of a 12-month follow-up."
32296502,Usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring of piperacillin and meropenem in routine clinical practice: a prospective cohort study in critically ill patients.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Beta-lactam anti-infective levels after standard dosing have been shown to be subtherapeutic when renal clearance is augmented. OBJECTIVE: To determine if piperacillin and meropenem are found to be in their therapeutic range in infected critically ill patients when administered by continuous intravenous infusion (CII) assisted by a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) report issued by the pharmacy service. METHODS: This prospective non-controlled intervention study evaluated septic patients in an intensive care unit. Patients received a loading dose of meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam and the antibiotics were afterwards administered by CII. Blood concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography assays. The adequacy of beta-lactam therapy in the cohort subjected to intervention was assessed by determining whether plasma levels during CII were >4 times the informed minimum inhibitory concentration during the first 96 hours of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were subject to TDM during antibiotic treatment but, for the analysis of the fulfilment of pharmacodynamic requirements, data from 31/124 (25%) were excluded. Of the whole cohort of treatment courses, 57/93 (61.3%) reached the target level. Plasma levels were adequate in 41/70 (58.6%) and 16/23 (69.6%) of the patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively. Globally, recommendations based on TDM results were followed in 35/93 (37.6%) of the treatment courses. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show that, in critically ill patients with sepsis, there is a significant proportion of treatment courses where target levels are not reached even if the antibiotics are administered by CII and TDM support is provided by the pharmacy service. This TDM support should be offered on a real-time basis to be really useful."
15583289,Direct identification of gram-positive cocci from routine blood cultures by using AccuProbe tests.,2004,"Rapid and reliable identification of bacteria directly from blood cultures is important in clinical practice to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. In this study, the performance of the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) in direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and group A and B streptococci from positive blood culture bottles was evaluated by using 6-year routine clinical laboratory blood culture material from Paijat-Hame Central Hospital, Lahti, Finland. With the enterococcal and group A and B streptococcal probes, the diagnostic performance of the test was excellent at a cutoff value of 50,000 relative light units (RLU) as recommended by the manufacturer. However, with the S. aureus probe, although the specificity was very high (99.8%), the sensitivity was low (72.4%). To improve the clinical usability of the direct AccuProbe identification, optimal cutoff values for the individual AccuProbe tests were defined by using receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Consequently, cutoff values for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae tests were adjusted to 30,000 RLU and for enterococci and to 55,000 RLU for group A and B streptococci. With these adjustments, the performance of the AccuProbe tests, especially that for S. aureus, was significantly improved."
15650792,[Clinical features of liver failure in children].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology, clinical and laboratory characteristics of hepatic failure in 105 children. METHODS: The clinical data of 105 children with hepatic failure treated in our hospital from January 1986 to June 2003 were retrospectively analyzed by EXCELL 2000 and t test. RESULTS: (1)Of the 105 children with hepatic failure, 9 were cases with fulminant hepatic failure, 38 with subacute hepatic failure and 58 with chronic hepatic failure. (2)Morbidity was the highest in 7-12 years old children (43/105, 41.0%) followed by infants (30/105, 28.6%). (3)CMV infection could be confirmed in 9 infants (30.0%), etiological diagnosis was not possible in 13 infants (43.3%). Etiological diagnosis could be confirmed in children over 1 year of age, which included hepatitis B (n=22, 29.3%), Wilson's disease (n=15, 20.0%), hepatitis A (n=10,13.3%). Etiology in 21 cases (28.0%) could not be confirmed. (4)Seventy-one cases (67.6%) had ascites, 34 of them (47.9%) had spontaneous peritonitis. Thirty-five cases were complicated with other infections. The commonest complication was pulmonary infection and sepsis was the next. Fifty-one cases (48.6%) had hydroelectrolyte imbalance. Forty-eight cases (46.2%) had hepatic encephalopathy, which may be subclinical in children under three years of age. (5)The incidence of hypoglycemia was 77.2%(71/92). CONCLUSION: The etiology of liver failure was related to age. CMV infection was the commonest in infants. HBV, HAV infection was the commonest in children over 1 year of age and Wilson?s disease was the next. It is necessary to prevent and manage the associated complications as early as possible such as spontaneous peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hydroelectrolyte imbalance and hypoglycemia etc."
25514515,"Daily iTBS worsens hand motor training--a combined TMS, fMRI and mirror training study.",2015,"INTRODUCTION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to increase regional excitability to improve motor function in combination with training after neurological diseases or events such as stroke. We investigated whether a daily application of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS; a short-duration rTMS that increases regional excitability) improves the training effect compared with sham stimulation in association with a four-day hand training program using a mirror (mirror training, MT). The right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC right) was chosen as the target region for iTBS because this region has recently been emphasized as a node within a network related to MT. METHODS: Healthy subjects were randomized into the iTBS group or sham group (control group CG). In the iTBS group, iTBS was applied daily over dPMC right, which was functionally determined in an initial fMRI session prior to starting MT. MT involved 20 min of hand training daily in a mirror over four days. The hand tests, the intracortical excitability and fMRI were evaluated prior to and at the end of MT. RESULTS: The results of the hand training tests of the iTBS group were surprisingly significantly poorer compared with those from the CG group. Both groups showed a different course of excitability in both M1 and a different course of fMRI activation within the supplementary motor area and M1 left. CONCLUSION: We suggest the inter-regional functional balance was affected by daily iTBS over dPMC right. Maybe an inter-regional connectivity within a network is differentially balanced. An excitability increase within an inhibitory-balanced network would therefore disturb the underlying network."
41502881,Herpes simplex virus 2-associated symmetrical peripheral gangrene in an immunocompetent fourteen-year-old girl: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is a rare but devastating clinical syndrome marked by symmetrical distal ischemic damage in the absence of large vessel obstruction or vasculitis, usually resulting in high mortality and frequent limb amputations among survivors. The underlying causes are multifactorial, including both infectious and noninfectious factors. However, neither the implicated etiological factors nor the precise mechanisms of pathogenesis have been fully elucidated, making diagnosis and management particularly challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: This report describes a 14-year-old girl who initially exhibited fever, edematous extremities, widespread erythema and small blisters on the trunk and extremities, and subsequent blackening of the fingers and toes. Her condition rapidly progressed to sepsis, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and early hemophagocytic syndrome, culminating in a diagnosis of SPG. Comprehensive etiological investigations revealed herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection as the underlying cause. Through prompt multidisciplinary interventions-including mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, antiviral therapy, anticoagulation, plasma exchange, immunosuppression, and meticulous wound care-the patient achieved a remarkable recovery, with only minor residual pigmentation on her extremities. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights HSV-2 as a rare but potential cause of SPG, broadening the spectrum of known pathogens. Early recognition, rapid diagnostic work-up, and timely multidisciplinary management are essential to improve outcomes and prevent limb loss."
25728075,"WU and KI polyomaviruses in respiratory, blood and urine samples from renal transplant patients.",2015,"BACKGROUND: It is suggested that immunosuppression due to transplantation might be a risk for human polyomavirus KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) infection. Most of the publications report data about stem cell transplant patients, little is known about these virus infections in renal transplant patients. OBJECTIVES: To study the presence of KIPyV and WUPyV in upper respiratory, plasma and urine samples from renal transplant patients. To analyse clinical and personal data. STUDY DESIGN: 532 respiratory, 503 plasma and 464 urine samples were collected from 77 renal transplant patients. KIPyV and WUPyV were detected by nested and quantitative real-time PCR. Patient and clinical data from medical records were analyzed. RESULTS: KIPyV was detected in respiratory, plasma and urine samples from 14.3%, 3.9% and 4.1% of renal transplant patients. WUPyV was found in respiratory and plasma specimens from 9.1% and 5.3% of the patients. Significant association was revealed between the detection of KIPyV and WUPyV and the time of samples collection and the age of the patients. KIPyV was presented in respiratory and plasma sample at the same time. KIPyV was detected in plasma samples from two patients and in urine samples of three other patients providing also KIPyV positive respiratory samples at the same time. No clinical consequences of KIPyV or WUPyV infection were found. CONCLUSION: Although no clinical consequences of KIPyV and WUPyV infections were found in renal transplant patients, it is suggested that renal transplantation might result in higher susceptibility or reactivation of these infection."
31888920,Transcholecystic approach for distal common bile duct stricture in a non-dilated biliary system: an alternative route.,2019,"A 63-year-old patient was admitted to intensive treatment unit with biliary sepsis due to a small distal common bile duct stone. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was initially attempted for insertion of a biliary stent but failed due to the presence of a periampullary diverticulum. Referral to interventional radiology for percutaneous drainage was considered the next alternative even though there was no dilatation of intrahepatic ducts. Due to complete absence of intrahepatic duct dilatation, the traditional percutaneous transhepatic route was considered rather challenging. An alternative percutaneous approach via the gallbladder and subsequent catheterisation of the duodenum via the distal common bile duct was successfully performed instead without complication. We would like to describe this technique as an alternative option for drainage of the non-dilated biliary system in patients with sepsis."
41586317,Early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of secondary bloodstream infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii in critically ill patients by machine-learning algorithms.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Secondary bloodstream infections (sBSI) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) are a major threat to patient safety in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to their prevalence and severity. Developing accurate predictive models is crucial for enhancing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to leverage machine learning (ML) to create a diagnostic model for predicting the risk of AB-sBSI in ICU patients and a prognostic model for assessing the associated 30-day mortality risk. METHODS: The multicenter, retrospective study enrolled 4,267 ICU patients with AB isolated from non-blood sites. Of these, 337 patients developed bloodstream infection. The analysis included 70 patients with confirmed AB secondary bloodstream infection (AB-sBSI) and 76 age and sex matched controls with non AB-sBSI. For 30-day mortality assessment, the AB-sBSI patients were categorized into non-survivors (n=39) and survivors (n=31). Demographic, microbiological, and laboratory data encompassing hematological, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were analyzed. Fourteen machine learning models were evaluated using the Deepwise and Beckman Coulter DxAI platforms with five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using five standard metrics, and the DeLong test was applied for AUC comparison. After data preprocessing, patients were enrolled to form an external validation cohort. RESULTS: The AB-sBSI risk diagnosis model, constructed with 11 features, identified red cell distribution width as the most significant predictor. The AdaBoost model outperformed both comparative models (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC) and the conventional biomarker C-reactive protein (AUC = 0.66), with AUCs of 0.937 in training and 0.786 in validation. For 30-day mortality prediction, another model based on 11 features selected lymphocyte count as the most influential variable. The AdaBoost model showed prominent efficacy, surpassing other model (Multilayer Perceptron, BernoulliNB, SGD) and achieving AUC values of 0.986 in training and 0.821 in validation. CONCLUSION: We developed two ML based models for predicting AB-sBSI risk and 30-day mortality. As a preliminary exploration, both models have been converted into accessible web tools. These tools are designed to assist clinicians in making informed decisions and promptly adjusting treatment strategies for critically ill patients."
41515590,Exploring the Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum Mid-Regional Pro-Adrenomedullin in Tick-Borne Encephalitis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"Background: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide with vasoregulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its stable fragment, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), is a validated biomarker in sepsis and systemic infections, but its role in viral neuroinfections remains unexplored. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), is a major viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with long-term neurological sequelae. This study aimed to assess MR-proADM levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with TBE and to evaluate their diagnostic utility and pathophysiological significance. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 20 patients with confirmed TBE and 14 non-infectious neurological controls. MR-proADM concentrations were measured in paired CSF and serum samples using an ELISA assay. Statistical analyses included group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test), correlation analyses (Spearman's r), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation. Results: Serum MR-proADM levels at baseline (SER1) were significantly lower in TBE patients compared with controls (p = 0.0197). The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio differed significantly between groups (p = 0.0063) and showed the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.816, 95% CI 0.63-0.93; sensitivity 79%, specificity 80%). MR-proADM concentrations in CSF correlated with total CSF protein (r = 0.53), suggesting an association with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Strong reproducibility was observed for serum MR-proADM between sampling points (r = 0.83). Conclusions: MR-proADM levels in CSF and serum are altered in patients with TBE, indicating its potential as a biomarker of CNS infection and inflammation. The CSF/serum MR-proADM ratio may serve as a sensitive indicator of blood-CSF barrier involvement, while decreased serum levels may reflect impaired systemic neuroprotective response. These findings highlight a possible role of ADM in neuroimmune regulation during viral encephalitis and warrant validation in larger prospective studies."

25553994,Risk factors of mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia.,2016,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Identification of risks of mortality for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), with early implementation of an appropriate therapy, is crucial for the patients' outcome. The aim of this study was to survey mortality risk factors in 182 patients with CRAB bacteremia in a medical center in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 182 isolates of CRAB bacteremia were collected from 2009 to 2012 in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan These isolates were identified by using the genotypic method. Risk of attributable mortality analysis was carried out with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 182 CRAB isolates belonged to 38 different pulsotypes. The attributable mortality rate of the 182 patients was 58.24%. The risk factors for attributable mortality included intensive care unit stay [hazard ratio (HR): 2.27; p = 0.011], an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of >20 (HR: 2.19; p < 0.001), respiratory tract as the origin of bacteremia (HR: 3.40; p < 0.001), and previous use of ceftriaxone (HR: 2.51; p = 0.011). The appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy was 18.87% (20/106) in the mortality group versus 88.16% (67/76) in the survivor group (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of CRAB to colistin was 100% and to tigecycline was 40.11%. CONCLUSION: The risk factors for mortality for CRAB included intensive care unit stay, a high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, respiratory tract as the origin of bacteremia, and previous use of ceftriaxone. Early implementation of an antimicrobial agent that had the highest in vitro activity against CRAB in patients at risk of CRAB bacteremia and high mortality may improve their outcome."
20301691,Classic Galactosemia and Clinical Variant Galactosemia.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The term ""galactosemia"" refers to disorders of galactose metabolism that include classic galactosemia, clinical variant galactosemia, and biochemical variant galactosemia (not covered in this chapter). This GeneReview focuses on: Classic galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage, bleeding, and E coli sepsis in untreated infants. If a lactose-restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the neonatal signs usually quickly resolve and the complications of liver failure, sepsis, and neonatal death are prevented; however, despite adequate treatment from an early age, children with classic galactosemia remain at increased risk for developmental delays, speech problems (termed childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria), and abnormalities of motor function. Almost all females with classic galactosemia manifest hypergonadatropic hypogonadism or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Clinical variant galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage including cirrhosis, and bleeding in untreated infants. This is exemplified by the disease that occurs in African Americans and native Africans in South Africa. Persons with clinical variant galactosemia may be missed with newborn screening as the hypergalactosemia is not as marked as in classic galactosemia and breath testing is normal. If a lactose-restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the severe acute neonatal complications are usually prevented. African Americans with clinical variant galactosemia and adequate early treatment do not appear to be at risk for long-term complications, including POI. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia is established by detection of elevated erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate concentration, reduced erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) enzyme activity, and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in GALT. In classic galactosemia, erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate is usually >10 mg/dL and erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is absent or barely detectable. In clinical variant galactosemia, erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is close to or above 1% of control values but probably never >10%-15%. However, in African Americans with clinical variant galactosemia, the erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity may be absent or barely detectable but is often much higher in liver and in intestinal tissue (e.g., 10% of control values). Virtually 100% of infants with classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia can be detected in newborn screening programs that include testing for galactosemia in their panel. However, infants with clinical variant galactosemia may be missed if the program only measures blood total galactose level and not erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Standard of care in any newborn who is ""screen-positive"" for galactosemia is immediate dietary intervention while diagnostic testing is under way. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, restriction of galactose intake is continued and all milk products are replaced with lactose-free formulas (e.g., Isomil((R)) or Prosobee((R))) containing non-galactose carbohydrates; dietary restrictions on all lactose-containing foods and other dairy products should continue throughout life, although management of the diet becomes less important after infancy and early childhood. In rare instances, cataract surgery may be needed in the first year of life. Childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria require expert speech therapy. Developmental assessment at age one year by a psychologist and/or developmental pediatrician is recommended in order to formulate a treatment plan with the speech therapist and treating physician. For school-age children, an individual education plan and/or professional help with learning skills and special classrooms as needed. Hormone replacement therapy as needed for delayed pubertal development and/or primary or secondary amenorrhea. Stimulation with follicle-stimulating hormone may be useful in producing ovulation in some women. Prevention of secondary complications: Recommended calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K intake to help prevent decreased bone mineralization; standard treatment for gastrointestinal dysfunction. Surveillance: Biochemical genetics clinic visits every three months for the first year of life or as needed depending on the nature of the potential acute complications; every six months during the second year of life; yearly thereafter. Routine monitoring for: the accumulation of toxic analytes (e.g., erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate and urinary galactitol); cataracts; speech and development; movement disorder; POI; nutritional deficiency; and osteoporosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Breast milk, proprietary infant formulas containing lactose, cow's milk, dairy products, and casein or whey-containing foods; medications with lactose and galactose. Evaluation of relatives at risk: To allow for earliest possible diagnosis and treatment of at-risk sibs: Perform prenatal diagnosis when the GALT pathogenic variants in the family are known; or If prenatal testing has not been performed, test the newborn for either the family-specific GALT pathogenic variants or erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity. Pregnancy management: Women with classic galactosemia should maintain a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy. GENETIC COUNSELING: Classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Couples who have had one affected child have a 25% chance of having an affected child in each subsequent pregnancy. Molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk sibs and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are an option if the GALT pathogenic variants in the family are known. If the GALT pathogenic variants in a family are not known, prenatal testing can rely on assay of GALT enzyme activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells."
15627840,"CD14- and toll-like receptor 4-dependent regulation of c-Fos, c-Jun and c-Jun phosphorylation in the adrenal gland after burn injury.",2004,"OBJECTIVES: Although the pathophysiology of the adrenocortical response after injury has been described, alterations in the molecular profile (e.g. transcription factors) of the adrenal gland itself are not well understood. The regulation of c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Jun phosphorylation in the adrenal gland after burn injury was investigated in this study. In addition, since burn injury is often associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated sepsis, we examined the involvement of the LPS signaling pathway in the regulation of these transcription factors utilizing CD14 knockout and C3H/HeJ (encoding defective toll-like receptor 4) mice. METHODS: Adrenal glands harvested after an 18% total body surface area burn were subjected to RT-PCR and Western blot analyses of c-Jun and c-Fos. RESULTS: There was a rapid induction of c-Jun and c-Fos expression (mRNA and protein), and c-Jun serine phosphorylation. The induction of c-Jun and its phosphorylation after injury was greater in CD14 knockout and C3H/HeJ mice compared to their respective controls. A similar pattern was observed in the c-Fos regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that c-Fos and c-Jun are activated in the adrenal gland in response to burn injury. In addition, an LPS-mediated signaling pathway may influence the regulation of these transcription factors after injury."
41471177,"Epidemiology of Fungal Bloodstream Infections and Antifungal Susceptibility in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Rare Candida Co-Infection Case.",2025,"BACKGROUND: In Saudi Arabia, rising multi-drug-resistant (MDR) fungal infections from broad-spectrum antifungal overuse highlight the urgent need for epidemiological and susceptibility research. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed fungal isolates from 55 patients with positive blood cultures in a Riyadh tertiary hospital, with identification and antifungal susceptibility tested via the VITEK-2 compact system. RESULTS: Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida (NAC) were isolated from 11 and 38 patients, respectively. In the NAC group, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis spp. were predominant. C. glabrata exhibited the highest resistance to antifungals. Increased rates of resistance were shown by fluconazole and itraconazole, whereas voriconazole was the most effective azole with the lowest resistance. No evidence of resistance was found against non-azole antifungals. A single case of triple resistance to ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole was observed in C. parapsilosis. A single isolate of C. albicans was resistant to all tested azoles. A rare instance of coinfection with C. glabrata and C. albicans was identified in a single male patient with a dual-resistance pattern against posaconazole and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of NAC, including tolerant isolates of C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata, along with multi-azole-resistant C. albicans and unique coinfection scenarios, urgently requires robust antifungal resistance surveillance."
25546667,D-dimer as an early marker of severity in patients with acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis.,2014,"No early serum marker of disease severity contributes to the treatment decision-making process of acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (ASMVT). This study aims to assess the value of serum D-dimer level in the first 3 days after admission as a severity marker of ASMVT patients. From May 2010 to June 2014, 50 consecutive patients of ASMVT were enrolled in this observational study. The serum D-dimer level was measured on a daily basis during the first 3 days after admission as well as other laboratory-testing parameters, clinical score, and outcome variables recorded during the same period. The maximum and mean D-dimer values were analyzed and compared with other potential markers for prediction of multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and short-bowel syndrome (SBS). The correlation of D-dimer level with other potential severity markers and inflammation parameters were also studied. Both maximum and mean D-dimer level during the first 3 days of admission were significantly higher in patients with several clinical variables such as death within 30 days, bowel resection, sepsis, abdominal compartment syndrome, MODS, and SBS. In addition, serum D-dimer level showed precise prediction for MODS and SBS, greater than L-lactate and intestinal-type fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP). The D-dimer level was correlated well with L-lactate, I-FABP, and APACHE II score on the first 3 days of admission. Poor correlation of D-dimer level and inflammation parameters, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level, was detected. D-dimer level could be an effective, early, and specific serum marker indicating the clinical evolution and outcome of ASMVT."
15599465,In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida blood isolates and evaluation of the E-test method.,2004,"Fungal infections have dramatically increased in recent years, along with the increase of drug-resistant isolates in immunocompromised patients. Ninety eight Candida species obtained from blood cultures at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan, from 1998 to 2000 were studied. These included 50 Candida albicans, 13 Candida glabrata, 24 Candida tropicalis and 11 Candida parapsilosis isolates. To investigate their susceptibility to commonly used antifungal drugs, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, and ketoconazole were determined. Both the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference broth macrodilution method and E-test were used in parallel. Ninety five isolates (95/98, 96.94%) were susceptible to amphotericin B at a concentration < or = 1 microg/mL. All isolates (100%, 98/98) were susceptible to flucytosine. Approximately 30% of these Candida isolates were resistant to fluconazole. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) values for both methods for these isolates were 0.5 microg/mL for amphotericin B, 32 microg/mL for fluconazole, 0.25 microg/mL for flucytosine (0.125 microg/mL by E-test method), and 4 microg/mL for ketoconazole. MIC for 50% of isolates (MIC50) values for these agents were 0.25, 2, 0.06, and 0.06 microg/mL, respectively. The essential agreement of MIC values within 2 dilutions for the 2 methods was 99.0% for amphotericin B, 90.8% for ketoconazole, 92.9% for fluconazole, and 91.8% for flucytosine. This study showed that E-test has equivalent performance to the broth macrodilution method and can be used as an alternative MIC technique for antifungal susceptibility testing."

20000066,Effect of joint iron and zinc supplementation on malarial infection and anaemia.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: In spite of interventions being put in place to reduce the burden of maternal anaemia and malaria in Ghana, they continue to impact negatively on pregnancy outcomes. It is unclear whether there are some other factors that limit the effectiveness of these interventions. The aim of this study was to explore whether there are benefits associated with the addition of zinc to the routine malaria chemoprophylaxis, iron and folic acid intervention package for pregnant women in Ghana. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the Upper West Region of Ghana. RESULTS: Iron-zinc supplementation reduced the risk of increased malaria parasitaemia associated with high maternal serum ferritin and Hb concentrations. Iron-zinc supplementation was associated with reduced malaria parasite densities, F (1, 20) = 4.744, p = 0.042. Iron and zinc provided in the ratio of 1:1 prevented a significant decline in maternal iron stores of pregnant women. Adjusted geometric mean serum ferritin concentration in the Iron-zinc Group was significantly higher than in the Control Group (22.9 microg/L versus 16.9 microg/L), F (1, 156)= 6.336, p = 0.013 CONCLUSIONS: Joint iron and zinc supplementation appears to be a better option than iron-only supplementation in malaria-endemic areas."
25542289,Changes in peripheral blood leucocytes of sheep experimentally infected with Mycoplasma agalactiae.,2015,"Contagious agalactia is a serious disease of small ruminants affecting mainly mammary glands, joints and eyes. In sheep, the main aetiological agent is Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) whose abilities to persist in the target organs are known. Since there is no information on the effect of acute and chronic Ma infection on circulating leucocytes, the present study was designed to monitor granulocytes, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, by flow cytometry, in female lactating sheep nasally infected with Ma. A profound depletion of leucocytes was observed from day 5 to day 34 post infection (p.i.). In particular, while the granulocytes returned to baseline levels by day 12 p.i., the monocytes remained significantly low until day 20 p.i. The infection caused a prolonged depletion of peripheral T lymphocytes (both CD4(+) and CD8(+)) while B lymphocytes remained unaltered throughout the study. Mycoplasma agalactiae was detected by real-time PCR in several anatomical sites (ear, nose and milk) from day 2-5 p.i. until the end of the study (i.e., day 50 p.i.) while a transient bacteraemia was observed from day 5 to day 12 p.i. The leucopenia observed following intranasal Ma infection is likely due to leucocyte infiltration within the target organs."
31836803,Altered monocytic phenotypes are linked with systemic inflammation and may be linked to mortality in dialysis patients.,2019,"The major causes for increased morbidity and mortality among chronic kidney disease patients are cardiovascular diseases and infection. A causal link between an activated immune system and aggravated atherosclerosis has been postulated that skews the system towards inflammatory responses. Previously, we demonstrated a positive association of pro-inflammatory cytokines with monocytic Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) expression and vessel wall infiltration in hemodialysis patients. Here, we question whether the responsiveness and cytokine repertoire of monocytes is altered by pre-activation and how this correlates with survival. EDTA whole blood from hemodialysis patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 34) was collected and leukocytes challenged with LPS. The distribution of monocyte subsets, YB-1(acetyl) content, and serum cytokine levels were determined. Compared to controls, dialysis patients have fewer classical (Mo1) and more intermediate (Mo2) and non-classical (Mo3) monocytes. In response to LPS, the Mo2 subset significantly increases (p < 0.001) in control subjects, but not in hemodialysis patients; increased CD86 expression indicates a positive response to LPS. Based on the changes within Mo2, subjects could be classified as responders or non-responders: 60% non-responders were seen in the dialysis cohort versus only 35% among healthy controls. YB-1 acetylation is higher in dialysis patients, independent of LPS stimulation. In this small cohort with 72 months follow-up period intracellular YB-1(acetyl) levels, IL-6, uPAR, and IP10 correlated with excess mortality in the dialysis cohort. Changes in YB-1 acetylation and serum cytokines may, at a given time point, possibly predict the long-term outcome and thus provide a legacy effect in hemodialysis patients."
16235597,[Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in the Dakar Fann University Hospital].,2004,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this report was to describe epidemiological, clinical, and bacteriological findings in cases of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Dakar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out on data recorded between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2002. The diagnosis of bacteremia was based on isolation of bacteria from blood culture. Bacterial susceptibility was studied with an antibiogram. Resistance to methicillin was assessed with a disk containing 5 microg of oxacillin on Mueller Hinton Agar containing 5% of NaCl. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty cases of S. aureus bacteremia were recorded. The mean age of patients was 31 years. Nosocomial bacteremia occurred in 22% of the cases. HIV infection was noted in 38 patients (29%). The death rate was 24%. Nosocomial and community-acquired strains were resistant to methicillin, respectively, in 72% and 51% of the cases. Bacteremias due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain were nosocomial infections in 23% of the cases. Most of the strains (80-100%) were susceptible to fusidic acid, gentamycin, erythromycin, and pefloxacin. All of them were susceptible to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Such a high rate of MRSA bacteremia, in particular among nosocomial bacteremia, makes it essential to reinforce preventive measures in our hospitals and to provide them with effective drugs against MRSA, such as vancomycin."
15689067,Assessment of therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine for vivax malaria in Thailand.,2004,"Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand."

20029251,Operation timing does not affect outcome after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Human factors such as fatigue, circadian rhythms, scheduling, and staffing may have an impact on patient care over the course of a day across all medical specialties. Research by the transportation industry concludes that human performance is degraded by shift work, circadian rhythm disturbances, and prolonged duty. This study investigated whether the timing of coronary artery bypass graft surgery affects outcomes. METHODS: The outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients were analyzed according to the hour of the day, day of the workweek, month, and moon phase in which the surgery started. All patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery between January 1, 1993 and July 1, 2006 were considered for the study.The primary outcome measurement was a compound morbidity outcome of six variables defined by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. These outcomes included (1) in-hospital death, (2) acute postoperative myocardial infarction, (3) neurologic morbidity, including focal or global neurologic deficits or death without awakening, (4) serious infection morbidity consisting of sepsis syndrome or septic shock, (5) new-onset renal failure requiring dialysis, and (6) postoperative ventilatory support exceeding 72 h. RESULTS: The composite morbidity and in-hospital mortality rates were 4.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The number of cases each weekday, each month of the year, and during each phase of the moon were consistent. None of the time factors significantly affected the composite morbidity outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery can be scheduled throughout the workday, any day of the work week and in any month of the year without compromising outcome."
20006540,"The prognosis of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treated HIV infected patients in Serbia, related to the time of treatment initiation.",2010,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) an impressive improvement in patient survival and quality of life has bee observed. However, the optimal timing of initial HAART is still under consideration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognosis of HAART treated patients in Serbia, related to the timing of HAART initiation. STUDY DESIGN: A series of 563 patients on HAART was retrospectively analyzed to investigate treatment response and survival. RESULTS: After a mean of 6 years (range 1-14) of treatment with PI-based and/or NNRTI-based regimens, a favorable response was achieved in 72.4%, treatment failure occurred in 7.9%, while 19.7% had a dissociative immunological/virological response. If treatment was initiated during primary HIV infection it took a shorter time to achieve a favorable response than in patients who began HAART in chronic HIV infection (2.7+/-2.2 years vs. 6.9+/-2.7 years, P<0.01). A higher proportion of patients with primary HIV infection then those treated in the chronic phase achieved a favorable response to HAART (88.4% vs. 71.9%, P=0.045). Patients who initiated HAART when their CD4 cell counts were below 200 cells/microL needed longer treatment for favorable response (8 years vs. 6 years, log rank P<0.01). Forty-seven (8.3%) patients died. The overall estimated survival was 13 years. Patients older then 40 and IVDU were more likely to die during HAART (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.9, P=0.016, and OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.7, P=0.02, respectively). However, reaching and maintaining undetectable viremia was an independent predictor of longer survival (OR 11.3, 95% CI 4.6-27.7, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Reaching and maintaining undetectable viremia during HAART predicted longer survival, even if sub-clinical immunodeficiency remained."
41432766,"Trends of incidence, management and outcome of renal trauma in Germany (2008-2022): an analysis based on the TraumaRegister DGU(R).",2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In prior times surgical treatment was the standard treatment of severe renal injuries while nowadays there is an increasing favor of conservative or interventional treatment. METHODS: Data retrieved from the TraumaRegister DGU(R) included 138,447 trauma patients (Max. AIS >/= 3) in Germany from 2008 to 2022. KEY FINDINGS: The incidence of kidney trauma decreased from 3.8% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2022 (p < 0.001). Higher grades of renal injury were associated with increased risks of kidney and multiorgan failure (AAST II: 29.0%; AAST V: 51.5%), dialysis (AAST II: 5%; AAST V: 18.9%), sepsis (AAST II: 9.2%; AAST V: 15.8%) and in-hospital mortality (AAST II: 9.4%; AAST V: 32.8%). The rate of surgical treatment remained constant with about 20%. The strongest predictor for operative treatment was AAST severity (reference: AAST grade II): Odds ratio for grade III was 4.50 (95% confidence interval 3.63-5.58, for grade IV 24.6 (19.1-31.8), and for grade V 58.9 (39.7-87.4). Further predictive factors were other abdominal injuries and the need for blood transfusions. Partial or radical nephrectomy was predominantly performed in high-grade renal injuries, with 62.1% (n = 36) in AAST V and 25.0% (n = 26) in other high-grade traumas. Interventional bleeding control was most frequent in AAST III (21.7%, n = 13) and AAST IV (19.2%, n = 20). CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of renal injuries has slightly declined, the rate of surgical interventions remains unchanged. Factors favoring surgery included hemodynamic instability and further abdominal trauma. Nephrectomies were mainly performed in high-grade renal trauma, while interventional bleeding control was more frequent in lower AAST grades."
25511124,Presepsin for the detection of late-onset sepsis in preterm newborns.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Late-onset sepsis (LOS) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm newborns, and currently available diagnostic tools are inadequate. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of presepsin (P-SEP) as novel biomarker of bacterial infection for the diagnosis of LOS in preterm newborns. METHODS: We prospectively studied newborns </=32 weeks' gestational age with LOS (n = 19) and noninfected controls (n = 21) at 4 to 60 days' postnatal age. At enrollment, and 1, 3, and 5 days later, we ascertained the C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and P-SEP in the LOS group, whereas P-SEP alone was ascertained in the control group. RESULTS: P-SEP at enrollment was higher in the LOS than the control group (median 1295 vs 562 ng/L, P = .00001) and remained higher throughout the study period. In the LOS group, P-SEP had a borderline reduction at day 1 versus values at enrollment (median 1011 vs 1295 ng/L, P = .05), whereas C-reactive protein and procalcitonin at day 1 did not differ from baseline values. The receiver operating characteristic curve of P-SEP at enrollment shows an area under the curve of 0.972. The best calculated cutoff value was 885 ng/L, with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Negative likelihood ratio was 0.05, and positive likelihood ratio was infinity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time in a cohort of preterm newborns that P-SEP is an accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of possible LOS and may also provide useful information for monitoring the response to therapeutic interventions."
41462086,Innovative application of mefloquine and Methacycline in combating Tet(X3/X4)-positive Escherichia coli infections.,2025,"The advent and global spread of plasmid-carried resistance genes, including the tigecycline resistance gene tet(X3/X4) and the colistin resistance gene mcr-1, present a substantial threat to public health that requires immediate resolution. This study successfully screened and identified commercial anti-parasitic drugs that efficiently inhibit Tet(X4) enzyme activity (IC(50) = 79.42 microg/mL), revealing that mefloquine exhibited a synergistic antibacterial effect with tetracyclines against tet(X3/X4)-positive bacteria (FIC < 0.5) and an additive effect with tetracyclines against tet(X3/X4)-negative bacteria (0.5 < FIC < 1, excluding minocycline). Molecular dynamics simulations and checkerboard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests on Tet(X4) mutants in amino acid residues demonstrated that mefloquine's interaction with the active site of Tet(X4) reduces its activity. The energy contribution of the binding site residues involves PHE221, PHE316, GLY233, PRO315, PHE232, MET212, ALA222 and HIE231, which establish robust interactions with mefloquine (Delta(Etotal) of </= - 0.5 kcal/mol). Moreover, findings from metabonomics, bacterial membrane analysis, ROS detection, NAD(+)/NADH ratio determination, and intracellular ATP determination indicated that mefloquine may significantly influence bacterial energy metabolism (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the mouse infection model of E. coli 47EC, the combination of methacycline and mefloquine, demonstrated significant therapeutic advantages, as evidenced by an increased survival rate (from 20.00% to 80.00%), decreased sepsis score, and decreased bacterial load. Our work is the first to reveal that the commercial medicine mefloquine can prolong the efficacy of tetracycline and treat infections caused by drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in clinical environments."
15622576,Reinterventions after complicated or failed stapled hemorrhoidopexy.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has become increasingly popular over the past five years, mainly because of the assumption that it is associated with less pain. However, persistent tags and recurrence might represent a problem, because piles are not excised and severe complications requiring surgery have been occasionally reported. The aim of the present study is to analyze the causes for and the outcome of reintervention following either severely complicated or failed stapled hemorrhoidopexy. METHODS: A total of 232 primary stapled hemorrhoidopexies and 65 reinterventions after stapled hemorrhoidopexy were performed by the authors in five centers devoted to colorectal surgery. Twelve patients of the latter group had the stapled hemorrhoidopexy performed in one of these centers. Thirty-five were males and 30 were females. The mean age was 50 (range, 29-81) years. In all cases the primary indication for stapled hemorrhoidopexy was either third-degree or fourth-degree symptomatic hemorrhoids. In all patients submitted to reoperation the diagnosis of either severely complicated or failed stapled hemorrhoidopexy was made. The clinical history of all of these patients was carefully studied and all underwent inspection, digital exploration, and proctoscopy. After the reintervention, proctoscopy was performed in 61 patients (92 percent) after a median follow-up of 5.5 (range, 1-36) months. RESULTS: Our reoperation rate after stapled hemorrhoidopexy was 11 percent. The most frequent indications for reintervention were persistent, severe anal pain (visual analog pain score higher than 7) in 29 patients (45 percent), severe postoperative bleeding in 20 (31 percent), anal fissure in 16 (21 percent), prolapsing piles in 12 (18 percent), rectal polyp in 11 (16 percent), anorectal sepsis in 11 (16 percent), and fecal incontinence in 7 (11 percent). Thirteen different types of reintervention were needed. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, removal of staples, and fissurectomy and/or internal sphincterotomy were the most frequent operation (n = 41). A decrease in anal pain, as measured by visual analog pain score, was observed one month after reintervention, compared with that measured preoperatively (from 5.6 +/- 3.6 to 3.0 +/- 2.9) (P < 0.001). Bleeding requiring treatment occurred in six cases (10 percent), anal stricture requiring dilation occurred in three (5 percent), and fecal incontinence in three (5 percent). Proctoscopy showed no recurrences in 52 cases (80 percent) after the reintervention. CONCLUSION: Pain and bleeding mostly caused by piles, fissures, and retained staples were the most frequent causes for reoperation after stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Reintervention was associated with a high bleeding and soiling rate, but was effective in treating pain and other symptoms in the majority of patients. Because of the wide spectrum of different interventions required, a failed or complicated stapled hemorrhoidopexy might be better treated by an experienced colorectal surgeon."
20120644,A comparison of the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia in pregnant and non pregnant women.,2009,"BACKGROUND: To compare the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and the mean parasite density in pregnant women at first antenatal visit with those of the control subjects at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi. METHOD: A case control prospective survey using a structured questionnaire to collect data from pregnant women attending antenatal clinic between 1 April and 30 September 2001 and matched controls at the GOPD during the same period. Peripheral blood smears were examined in 420 pregnant women at their first antenatal visit and 200 control subjects to compare the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and mean parasite density in pregnant women and controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of parasitaemia was 79.3 percent (i.e. 333 of 420) for pregnant women and 31.5 percent (or 63 of 200) for the control. For both pregnant women and controls, an overall prevalence of 63.1 percent was observed. The study found the mean parasite density for the pregnant women to be 1978 +/- 1531 (Mean +/- SD), while that of the controls was 766 +/- 1923. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the higher prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and mean parasite density in pregnant women when compared with the matched controls."

Catheter fragments may cause cardiac perforation, arrythmias, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis. We report the successful retrieval of intracardiac CVC fragments by percutaneous transcatheter technique in two infants, aged 8 and 15 months. Double-lumen 7 French Hickman CVCs were accidentally fractured during their removal. Chest radiographs of the two patients revealed migrated intracardiac catheter fragments extending from the superior vena cava (SVC) to the right atrium and from the SVC to the right ventricle, respectively. The procedure was performed under ketamine anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance using a percutaneous femoral vein approach. Nitinol Amplatz Goose Neck snares (10 mm in diameter) were used to successfully retrieve the catheter fragments without any complication. Percutaneous transcatheter retrieval of catheter fragments using Goose Neck snare is a safe and successful technique and can be chosen before resorting to surgery, which has potential risks related to general anesthesia, thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass."
20014613,Brain death in a septic patient: possible relationship with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome?,2009,"A 41-year-old man with a previous kidney transplant was referred for arterial hypertension and acute renal failure. Initial neurological examination was normal. Laboratory data showed a high serum cyclosporine A concentration. A few hours later, he developed generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The brain computed tomogram was not remarkable, but Glasgow Coma Scale score remained at 8. Mechanical ventilation was required for rapidly progressive hypoxaemia related to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and septicaemia. Noradrenaline infusion was needed for only nine hours, with no major drop in mean arterial blood pressure. On day three his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3/15, with fixed dilated pupils. The brain computed tomogram revealed bilateral hypodense lesions in the posterior areas together with cerebral oedema and the patient was subsequently declared brain dead. We discuss the possibility of a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, likely triggered by a gram-positive septicaemia in addition to other risk factors."
20017442,[Complete remission of nephrotic syndrome and improvement of renal function in a patient with light chain deposition disease following high dose chemotherapy with transplantation of autologous haematopoietic stem cells. A case study and review of literature].,2009,"Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) damages most frequently kidneys, and less frequently other organs. The incidence of LCDD is lower than the incidence of AL-amyloidosis. Symmetric swelling of both legs was the first sign of nephrotic syndrome with renal insufficiency in our female patient. Renal biopsy specimen revealed the diagnosis of LCDD. Bone marrow biopsy contained 40% of plasma cells. Bone survey showed no osteolytic changes. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon stage IB with LCDD. The patient was initially treated with 4 cycles of VAD (vinkristine, adriamycine, dexamethasone) chemotherapy with no response. Followed collection of peripheral haematopoietic stem cells and later high dose chemotherapy with reduced dose of melphalan 140 mg/sqm and autologous peripheral haematopoietic stem cells transplantation. Melphalan dose was reduced because of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 290 micromol/l) before application of conditioning regimen. High dose therapy was complicated by with deterioration of renal function, creatinine increased to 600 micromol/l. Worsening of renal function was most likely caused by nephrotoxicity of melphalan in nephrotic syndrome. This has been previously described in patients with AL-amyloidosis, and nephrotic syndrome who were treated with high dose melphalan. This phenomenon was entitled ""post conditioning renal insufficiency"". Hypoalbuminemia hypoproteinemia and reduced intravascular volume and renal damage caused by amyloid deposits as well as probably, amorphous non-amyloid deposits of monoclonal immunoglobulin are likely to have contributed to nephrotoxicity of the high dose of melphalan. However, worsening of renal insufficiency was facilitated by the mucositis-associated sepsis. Follow-up examination one month after high dose chemotherapy showed complete remission, that was confirmed by further examinations. In the course of the first year after high dose chemotherapy renal function gradually improved and nephrotic syndrome completely disappeared (complete kidney remission). Proteinuria declined to 2-3 g/24 hours and glomerular filtration slowly improved. Three years after high dose chemotherapy the patient is still in complete remission of multiple myeloma and free of nephrotic syndrome, with slightly increased creatinine (160 micromol/l) that, nevertheless, has had an improving tendency over last 3 years. The present case study illustrates accomplishment of complete haematological remission with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cells transplantation despite complete resistance of the disease to the standard chemotherapy VAD in a patient with MM and LCDD. We draw the reader's attention to the possibility of nephrotoxic effects of high dose melphalan (post conditioning renal insufficiency) in patients with nephrotic syndrome caused by light chain deposits as AL-amyloid or amorphous light chains deposits (LCDD)and we document the importance of plasma free light chain detection."
31987145,Sepsis progression monitoring via human serum fibronectin detection based on sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor.,2020,"Sepsis has always been a severe clinical problem in critical care medicine due to its rather high mortality and poor prognosis. The current study reported for the first time a practical immunosensor for fibronectin (FN) detection in human serum by electrochemistry. A simple but robust sandwich-type strategy was employed without any complex design or material modifications, which exhibited a linear calibration plot over the 15.625-500 ng/mL concentration range and a detection limit of 15 ng/mL. The results showed that the proposed strategy displayed an excellent selectivity against other non-target substances in human serum, a higher accuracy and a better stability when compared with the traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in detecting the same or mixed serum from 21 healthy subjects. Furthermore, the proposed electrochemical immunosensor successfully monitored the level of serum FN at various time points in five septic patients during the treatment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy is highly sensitive and accurate in monitoring sepsis progress and has significant clinical improvements over the ELISA methodology, signifying a great potential of a commercial kit."
25496103,An official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults.,2014,"RATIONALE: Profound muscle weakness during and after critical illness is termed intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). OBJECTIVES: To develop diagnostic recommendations for ICUAW. METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert committee generated diagnostic questions. A systematic review was performed, and recommendations were developed using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Severe sepsis, difficult ventilator liberation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation are associated with ICUAW. Physical rehabilitation improves outcomes in heterogeneous populations of ICU patients. Because it may not be feasible to provide universal physical rehabilitation, an alternative approach is to identify patients most likely to benefit. Patients with ICUAW may be such a group. Our review identified only one case series of patients with ICUAW who received physical therapy. When compared with a case series of patients with ICUAW who did not receive structured physical therapy, evidence suggested those who receive physical rehabilitation were more frequently discharged home rather than to a rehabilitative facility, although confidence intervals included no difference. Other interventions show promise, but fewer data proving patient benefit existed, thus precluding specific comment. Additionally, prior comorbidity was insufficiently defined to determine its influence on outcome, treatment response, or patient preferences for diagnostic efforts. We recommend controlled clinical trials in patients with ICUAW that compare physical rehabilitation with usual care and further research in understanding risk and patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Research that identifies treatments that benefit patients with ICUAW is necessary to determine whether the benefits of diagnostic testing for ICUAW outweigh its burdens."
31822290,Risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury in South African critically ill adults: a prospective cohort study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: There is a marked paucity of data concerning AKI in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a substantial burden of trauma and HIV. METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients, AKI was common, often associated with trauma in addition to traditional risk factors and was associated with good functional renal recovery at 90 days in most survivors. Although the HIV prevalence was high and associated with higher mortality, this was related to the severity of illness and not to HIV status per se."
20013578,Treatment of patent ductus arteriosus: indomethacin or ibuprofen?,2010,"We compared ibuprofen and indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. A retrospective comparative study was conducted at a pediatric tertiary center in preterm infants diagnosed with PDA. Infants born from January 2000 to June 2003 were treated with indomethacin, whereas infants born from July 2003 to November 2005 were treated with ibuprofen. The two treatment groups were compared. Demographic data and clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from the medical files. Seventy-three infants were included in the ibuprofen group and 46 in the indomethacin group. No significant difference in efficacy was found between indomethacin and ibuprofen. Compared with ibuprofen, indomethacin treatment was associated with significantly higher mean creatinine levels and a higher percent of infants with creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, hyponatremia <120 mmol/L, and platelet level <100,000 platelets/mL(3). There were no significant differences in bilirubin levels, incidence and grade of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, rate of surgical duct ligation, sepsis, length of hospital stay, or mortality. Indomethacin and ibuprofen are equally effective for PDA closure in premature infants. Treatment with ibuprofen is safer, decreasing the risk of renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia."
41406025,Comparison of the VITEK REVEAL AST and Accelerate Pheno systems for fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative blood cultures at a large academic health system.,2026,"Timely initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial for patients with Gram-negative (GN) blood stream infections. In this study, the performance of VITEK REVEAL (bioMerieux, USA), an FDA cleared in vitro diagnostic automated system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) directly from positive blood culture (BC), was compared to that of Accelerate Pheno (Accelerate Diagnostics, USA), as standard of care method. 128 GN positive BCs were analyzed according to manufacturer recommendations, comparing time to result (TTR) and AST results. The categorical agreement (CA) rate between VITEK REVEAL and Accelerate Pheno was 94.3% and the essential agreement (EA) rate was 96.0%. Very major discrepancies (VMD), major discrepancies (MD), and minor discrepancies (miD) rates between the systems were 7.5%, 0.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. Lastly, we observed a mean sequential TTR (reporting of AST results per antibiotic in real-time) on VITEK REVEAL of 6.1 h (3.0-8.2) and mean final TTR of 7.9 h (6.5-8.2), compared to Accelerate Pheno, with a significantly shorter mean final TTR of 7.1 h (6.8-7.7). Sequential TTR on VITEK REVEAL was significantly shorter for resistant isolates (those with >/=1 'Resistant' antimicrobial-organism combination interpretation, using FDA STIC 2024 or CLSI M100 criteria) compared to susceptible/intermediate ones, with a mean difference of 1.4 h (P  <  0.001). Overall, compared to Accelerate Pheno, VITEK REVEAL displayed high %CA and %EA for AST of GN bacteria directly from positive BC. Also, unlike Accelerate Pheno, VITEK REVEAL reports MIC results in real time, allowing an earlier release of actionable information useful for antimicrobial stewardship. IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have compared the performance of the VITEK REVEAL, system for fast antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to conventional, non-rapid microbiology methods. To evaluate how the VITEK REVEAL correlates to similarly available fast, direct-from-blood culture AST technologies, this study aimed to compare it to the Accelerate Pheno system, as standard of care method. High categorical agreement (94.3%) and essential agreement (96.0%) between the two systems were observed, underscoring their reliability. The VITEK REVEAL has the advantage of real-time AST reporting, unlike the Accelerate Pheno. Ultimately, this study supports the need for and continued optimization of fast diagnostic technologies for AST, contributing to the goal of advancing antimicrobial stewardship-focused treatment strategies and improving the prognosis of patients with bloodstream infections."
31828250,"Loss of Haemodynamic Coherence, Diagnosed Using a Continuous Monitoring of Oesophageal Photoplethysmography.",2019,"We report the case of a 75-year-old man with appendicular peritonitis in whom we observed oesophageal tissue perfusion, using a new photoplethysmographic probe. As the patient suffered from lactic acidosis, we chose to increase the mean arterial pressure (MAP) using norepinephrine. Thanks to an oesophageal photoplethysmographic signal, we could observe a loss of haemodynamic coherence and a severe alteration of tissue perfusion triggered by the MAP increase. Considering new information regarding the tissue perfusion status, we were able to adjust our MAP targets accordingly and restore the initial perfusion index values. This case illustrates the loss of haemodynamic coherence and highlights the clinical relevance of continuous tissue perfusion monitoring to highlight potential adverse norepinephrine effects."
31868865,Factors Associated With Severe Nonmeningitis Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in Adults in France.,2019,"BACKGROUND: In France, pneumococcal vaccination in adults is recommended for risk groups (chronic conditions/immunosuppression). We conducted a study on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults to identify factors associated with disease severity and death. METHODS: We included IPD cases, excluding meningitis, from 25 acute care hospitals in 6 regions. We defined severe cases as those with shock or severe sepsis or intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation. We included deaths occurring within 30 days of hospitalization. Infectious disease specialists collected clinical/microbiological data on cases. RESULTS: During 2014-2017, 908 nonmeningitis IPD cases were diagnosed; 48% were severe, 84% had comorbidities, 21% died. Ninety percent of cases with comorbidities who previously sought health care were not vaccinated against pneumococcus. Compared with previously healthy cases, the risk of severe IPD increased from 20% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.4) in cases with 1-2 chronic diseases to 30% (aRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-7.0) in those with >2 chronic diseases. Among risk groups, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) nonPCV13 serotypes were more likely to induce severe IPD compared with nonvaccine serotypes (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9; aRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a cumulative effect of concurrent comorbidities on severe IPD. Vaccine serotypes were more likely to induce severe IPD among risk groups. The missed opportunities for vaccination underscore the need to enhance vaccination in risk groups."
25514440,Emergence of a KPC-3-Producing Escherichia coli ST69 as a Cause of Bloodstream Infections in Italy.,2015,"The spread of carbapenem-resistant gram negatives is a global emergency, and surveillance of new resistant clones is critical from both public health and clinical standpoints. Herein, we describe the emergence of a KPC-3-producing Escherichia coli ST69 as a cause of bloodstream infection in two Italian patients."
25929121,Knowledge and recognition of SIRS and sepsis among pediatric nurses.,2014,"BACKGROUND: A large amount of research demonstrates the importance of key interventions in reducing mortality rates of pediatric patients with sepsis (Dellinger et al., 2008). Assessment and recognition of declining status must occur for interventions to be initiated. Of health care practitioners, nurses typically spend the most time with patients, and they must be knowledgeable in recognizing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis while also being aware of the importance of prompt intervention. The literature does not discuss pediatric nurses' knowledge of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis recognition. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge of acute and critical care pediatric nurses of SIRS diagnostic criteria, sepsis guidelines, and the importance of SIRS recognition. METHODS: This cross-sectional, quantitative, correlational descriptive study included 242 acute and critical care pediatric nurses at a 490-bed urban pediatric hospital. Participants completed an original questionnaire with face and content validity regarding SIRS criteria, sepsis guidelines, priority interventions, and attitude toward the importance of SIRS recognition. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated a significant knowledge deficit among participants in several key areas of SIRS/sepsis recognition. The mean score was 60.8% +/- 7.4%. Item analyses demonstrated nurses easily recognize septic shock but have difficulty recognizing patients in earlier stages of the sepsis continuum. Significant confusion was evident regarding the role of blood pressure and serum lactic acid levels in diagnosing sepsis. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that an educational intervention be created for acute and critical care pediatric nurses to aid them in recognizing sepsis in its earlier stages."
31888093,"Dichotomy in Fatal Outcomes in a Large Cohort of People Living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.",2019,"Background: Despite its relatively low incidence of associated diseases, Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (HTLV-1) infection was reported to carry a significant risk of mortality in several endemic areas. HTLV-1-associated diseases, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), as well as frequent coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Strongyloides stercoralis were associated to increased morbidity and mortality of HTLV-1 infection. Objective: To determine the mortality rate and its associated variables from an open cohort started in July 1997 at the HTLV Clinic, Emilio Ribas Institute (IIER), a major infectious disease hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Since inception up to September 2018, we admitted 727 HTLV-1-infected individuals, with a rate of 30-50 new admissions per year. All patient data, including clinical and laboratory data, were regularly updated throughout the 21-year period, using a dedicated REDCap database. The Ethical Board of IIER approved the protocol. Results: During 21 years of clinical care to people living with HTLV-1 in the Sao Paulo region, we recruited 479 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected individuals and 248 HAM/TSP patients, of which 632 remained under active follow-up. During a total of 3800 person-years of follow-up (maximum follow-up 21.5 years, mean follow-up 6.0 years), 27 individuals died (median age of 51.5 years), of which 12 were asymptomatic, one ATLL patient and 14 HAM/TSP patients. HAM/TSP diagnosis (but neither age nor gender) was a significant predictor of increased mortality by univariate and multivariate (hazard ratio (HR) 5.03, 95% CI [1.96-12.91], p = 0.001) Cox regression models. Coinfection with HIV/HCV was an independent predictor of increased mortality (HR 15.08; 95% CI [5.50-41.32]; p < 0.001), with AIDS-related infections as a more frequent cause of death in asymptomatics (6/13; p = 0.033). HIV/HCV-negative fatal HAM/TSP cases were all female, with urinary tract infection and decubitus ulcer-associated sepsis as the main cause of death (8/14, p = 0.002). Conclusions: All-cause mortality among people living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo differs between asymptomatic (2.9%) and HAM/TSP patients (7.3%), independent of age and gender. We observe a dichotomy in fatal cases, with HAM/TSP and HIV/HCV coinfection as independent risk factors for death. Our findings reveal an urgent need for public health actions, as the major causes of death, infections secondary to decubitus ulcers, and immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related infections, can be targeted by preventive measures."
20005417,Graft-versus-host disease presenting with pancytopenia after en bloc multiorgan transplantation: case report and literature review.,2009,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a dreaded complication of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation. Commonly affected organs include skin, liver, and the gastrointestinal tract, with bone marrow and renal involvement occurring more rarely. GVHD is less commonly seen with solid organ transplants. Fewer than 100 cases of GVHD have been reported in the literature following liver transplantation. We report a case of a 53-year-old woman who required a multiorgan transplant after a complicated postoperative course following paraduodenal hernia repair. She developed isolated pancytopenia approximately 4 months after receiving an en bloc transplant involving the liver, kidney, small bowel, and pancreas. No evidence of skin, gastrointestinal, or hepatic involvement was discovered. HLA typing of the peripheral blood revealed that 28% of patient peripheral blood was composed of donor lymphocytes. Bone marrow biopsy showed a markedly hypocellular marrow with 23% donor lymphocytes and 80% of the T-cell population from the donor as well. The patient began treatment for GVHD, including high-dose steroids, basiliximab, and rituximab. Unfortunately, she developed overwhelming sepsis and subsequently died. This case describes an instance of GVHD manifested by isolated pancytopenia after en bloc transplantation of multiple solid organs. GVHD is a rare, but serious complication of solid organ transplantation that can result in death. Although isolated bone marrow involvement is uncommon, it must be considered early to avoid a delay in diagnosis. This case also highlights an association of GVHD with multiorgan transplants, although this is incompletely characterized in the current literature."
31929912,A Case of Linezolid Toxicity Presenting as a Sepsis Mimic.,2019,"Linezolid is an efficacious and well tolerated antimicrobial but can have serious adverse effects including myelo-suppression, serotonin syndrome, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and lactic acidosis. The side effects are generally duration dependent; linezolid use is not recommended for more than 28 days. Case. A 59-year-old female presented with malaise, loss of appetite, and altered mentation. She had multiple medical comorbidities and required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin for venous thromboembolism. She had multiple medication allergies. Prior to admission, she was on linezolid for cellulitis of foot due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). On physical exam, she was drowsy and required endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Initial laboratory parameters showed lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, supra-therapeutic coagulation profile, low blood glucose, and transaminitis. Her altered mentation was due to hypoglycemia. The interaction with warfarin led to altered coagulation profile. She developed shock and vasopressors were initiated. Given her presentation, she was managed as severe sepsis. There were no active infectious foci attributing to decline of her clinical status. Linezolid was discontinued and she was managed with intravenous polymyxin B, aztreonam, and vancomycin. Her hemodynamic status improved within one day. She was extubated on Day 5 of her presentation. Her laboratory parameters showed gradual improvement over 12 days after discontinuation of linezolid. Retrospective evaluation revealed linezolid toxicity as possible cause of presentation. Linezolid toxicity can present as sepsis mimic and should be considered as a differential diagnosis while managing sepsis with other antimicrobial agents."
31866130,Sensitivity of differential time to positivity compared to pour plates for diagnosing catheter-related blood stream infection: An evaluation in patients with chronic intestinal failure.,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A retrospective evaluation was undertaken in intestinal failure (IF) patients with long term CVCs to evaluate differential time to positivity (DTP) against paired quantitative blood cultures (PP) for the diagnosis of CRBSI. METHODS: A list of patients with a diagnosis of CRBSI was obtained from the intestinal failure unit database for a five year period, 2013 to 2017. Microbiology records were reviewed to obtain further information about blood culture and pour plate examinations. Organisms and times of collection, loading and positivity were recorded. Patients with a contemporaneous set of central and peripheral PP and blood cultures were included in an analysis of the sensitivity of DTP compared to PP. RESULTS: There were 61 (45.5%) episodes in 56 patients where complete sets of central and peripheral blood cultures and PP were received. All 61 episodes had positive central blood cultures, 59 (96.7%) had positive central line PP and 17 (27.9%) had positive peripheral PP. Using PP as the gold standard, DTP sensitivity was 96.0% for 50 episodes where PP were consistent with CRBSI. Sensitivity increased to 100% for 17 episodes where there were no delays in either collection or loading of blood cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation to support the use of DTP as a sensitive test in diagnosing CRBSI in patients with IF and provides confidence to IF centers where pour plate cultures are not available."
25498795,"Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review.",2014,"INTRODUCTION: Critically ill patients with sepsis are prone to develop cardiac dysrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation (AF). Systemic inflammation, circulating stress hormones, autonomic dysfunction, and volume shifts are all possible triggers for AF in this setting. We conducted a systematic review to describe the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web Of Science were searched for studies reporting the incidence of new-onset AF, atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia in patients with sepsis admitted to an intensive care unit, excluding studies that primarily focused on postcardiotomy patients. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE system. Risk factors were considered to have a high level of evidence if they were reported in >/= 2 studies using multivariable analyses at a P value <0.05. Subsequently, the strength of association was classified as strong, moderate or weak, based on the reported odds ratios. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. Overall quality was low to moderate. The weighted mean incidence of new-onset AF was 8% (range 0 to 14%), 10% (4 to 23%) and 23% (6 to 46%) in critically ill patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, respectively. Independent risk factors with a high level of evidence included advanced age (weak strength of association), white race (moderate association), presence of a respiratory tract infection (weak association), organ failure (moderate association), and pulmonary artery catheter use (moderate association). Protective factors were a history of diabetes mellitus (weak association) and the presence of a urinary tract infection (weak association). New-onset AF was associated with increased short-term mortality in five studies (crude relative effect estimates ranging from 1.96 to 3.32; adjusted effects 1.07 to 3.28). Three studies reported a significantly increased length of stay in the ICU (weighted mean difference 9 days, range 5 to 13 days), whereas an increased risk of ischemic stroke was reported in the single study that looked at this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset AF is a common consequence of sepsis and is independently associated with poor outcome. Early risk stratification of patients may allow for pharmacological interventions to prevent this complication."
41561794,Autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) following urethral sling placement: A case report.,2026,"A 39-year-old woman developed debilitating systemic symptoms following the placement of a synthetic mid-urethral sling for stress urinary incontinence. Previously in good health, she experienced sepsis and adrenal crisis immediately postoperatively, followed by persistent symptoms including fatigue, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), neuropathic pain, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic instability, and recurrent infections. Despite extensive multispecialty evaluations, no definitive diagnosis was initially reached. Laboratory testing later revealed positive ANA and mild immune dysregulation. Given her complex autoimmune history, strong family predisposition, and the temporal association with mesh implantation, her presentation was suspected to be consistent with autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). She elected to undergo surgical removal of the synthetic sling with placement of an autologous rectus fascia pubovaginal sling. Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant resolution of her symptoms, restored bladder function, and improved quality of life. This case demonstrates a temporal association consistent with ASIA, with complete symptom resolution by 3 months post-explant and sustained well-being at 1 year."
31864869,Failure of vital sign normalization is more strongly associated than single measures with mortality and outcomes.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Modified Early Warning Systems (MEWS) scores offer proxies for morbidity and mortality that are easily acquired, but there are limited data on what changing MEWS scores within the ED indicate. We examined the correlation of changing MEWS scores during resuscitation in the ED and in-hospital morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on medical ED patients with simplified MEWS scores (without urine output or mental status) admitted to a single academic tertiary care center over one year. Triage-to-Last delta MEWS score and Triage-to-Max delta MEWS scores were calculated and correlated to in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and diagnosis of sepsis. RESULTS: Our analysis included 8322 ED patients with an ICU admission rate of 17% and a mortality rate of 2%. Every point of worsened MEWS after triage was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.96-2.97) than triage MEWS alone (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.44; p < 0.001). Likewise, each point of worsened MEWS was associated with increased odds of ICU admission (Triage-to-Last: OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.92-2.33 and Triage-to-Max: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.45-1.60, respectively). Among patients with suspected infection, similar associations are found. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic vital signs in the emergency department, as categorized by delta MEWS, and failure to normalize abnormalities, were associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, LOS, and the diagnosis of sepsis. Our results suggest that MEWS scores that do not normalize, from triage onward, are more strongly associated with outcome than any single score."
25551845,Comparison of serum IL-1beta and C reactive protein levels in early diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis.,2014,"Clinical signs and symptoms of non-infectious diseases are similar to those of infectious diseases during infancy. Therefore, rapid new methods for diagnosis of infections in infants are urgently needed. To examine the utility of measuring serum IL-1 beta for immediate diagnosis of sepsis in infants, in this cross-sectional epidemiological study blood samples were taken from 83 infants (41 female and 42 male) in whom infection was suspected and who were admitted to hospital. To perform serum interleukin (IL)-1 beta and quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) tests, blood samples were placed in ice containers and delivered to the laboratory. The serum was removed from the samples at 4 degrees Celsius and stored in refrigerators at minus 30 degrees Celsius until the time of testing. The results were analysed by t tests. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of serum IL-1 beta were 27%, 71%, 25%, and 73%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of serum quantitative CRP were 76%, 60%, 40% and 88%, respectively. Hence quantitative serum CRP measurement for the diagnosis of infections is more efficient than measuring serum IL-1 beta levels. In general, quantitative serum CRP measurement as an alternative to other tests such as serum IL-1 beta assays might be an ideal test for diagnosing infections in infants."
25509560,DRESS syndrome with hepatic involvement in a patient with depressive disorder.,2014,"We present a 31-year-old woman with a depressive disorder admitted in the Infectious Diseases Department with high fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, generalized rash and progressive jaundice. Sepsis with hepatic involvement was initially suspected, but the bacteriological and serological profiles for viral and bacterial pathogens remained negative. The exposure to antidepressant medication including lamotrigine, an aromatic anticonvulsant molecule, raised the suspicion of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Syndrome. The antidepressants were withdrawn and methylprednisolone therapy was started with a favorable outcome and lent recovery after two months. This case highlights a rare drug allergic complication to antidepressant medication evolving as a sepsis with hepatic dysfunction."
25538521,"Five-year experience with the peri-operative goal directed management for surgical repair of traumatic aortic injury in the eastern province, Saudi Arabia.",2014,"CONTEXT: Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) accounts for 1/3 of all trauma victims. AIM: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of the adopted standardized immediate pre-operative and intra-operative hemodynamic goal directed control, anesthetic technique and organs protection on the morbidity and mortality in patients presented with TAI. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An observational retrospective study at a single university teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical approval, we recruited the data of 44 patients admitted to the King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, with formal confirmation of diagnosis of blunt TAI during a 5-year period from February 2008 to April 2013 from the hospital medical records. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 44 victims (41 men, median (range) age 29 (22-34) years) with TAI who underwent surgical repair were recruited. Median (range) post-operative chest tube output was 700 (200-1100) ml necessitated transfusion in 5 (11.4%) of cases. Post-operative complications included transient renal failure (13.6%), pneumonia (6.8%), acute lung injury/distress syndrome (20.5%), sepsis (4.5%), wound infection (47.7%) and air leak (6.8%). No patient developed end stage renal failure or spinal cord injury. Median intensive care unit stay was 6 (4-30) days and in-hospital mortality was 9.1%. CONCLUSION: We found that the implementation of a standardized early goal directed hemodynamic control for the peri-operative management of patients with TAI reduces the post-operative morbidity and mortality after surgical repair."
20032253,Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum cephalosporinase-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis isolates from patients in Thailand and Denmark.,2010,"The objective of this study was to characterize extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC)-producing isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis recovered from patients in Thailand and Denmark. Twenty-four blood culture isolates from 22 patients were included in the study, of which 23 isolates were recovered from 21 Thai patients during 2003, 2007, or 2008 and one isolate was recovered from a Danish traveler to Thailand. ESC production was confirmed in 13 out of the 24 isolates by MIC testing. Microarray and plasmid profiling (replicon typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP]) were used to characterize the genetic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in the 13 ESC-producing isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MIC testing were used to compare the clonality between the 13 ESC-producing isolates and the 11 non-ESC-producing isolates. Based on susceptibility patterns, the ESC-producing isolates were more closely related than non-ESC-producing isolates. Microarray, PCR, plasmid profiling, and replicon typing revealed that the 13 ESC-producing isolates harbored either bla(CMY-2) containing incA/C or bla(CTX-M-14) containing incFIIA, incFrepB, and an unknown replicon located on plasmids ranging in size from 75 to 200 kb. The RFLP and replicon typing clustered the isolates into four distinct groups. PFGE revealed 16 unique patterns and five clusters; each cluster contained two or three of the 24 isolates. The isolate from the Danish patient was indistinguishable from two Thai clinical isolates by PFGE. This study revealed the emergence of the bla(CTX-M-14) gene among several clones of Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis. Numerous plasmids were identified containing up to two different ESC genes and four distinct replicons. A ""travel-associated"" spread was confirmed. Overall, a high degree of clonal diversity between isolates resistant and susceptible to cephalosporins was observed. The findings represent a serious threat to public health for the Thai people and tourists."
31865955,"Surveillance and comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of ESKAPE organisms isolated from patients with bacteraemia in South Africa, 2016 - 2017.",2019,"BACKGROUND: In South Africa (SA), the National Department of Health has developed an Antimicrobial Resistance National Strategy Framework document to manage antimicrobial resistance (AMR). One of the strategic objectives is to optimise surveillance and early detection of AMR. At the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), an analysis of selected organisms and antimicrobial agents from both the public and the private sectors was conducted. OBJECTIVES: The relevance of surveillance for AMR is increasingly recognised in the light of global action plans to combat resistance. In this report, we present an overview of ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) organisms and Escherichia coli reported from public and private sector laboratories in SA for the period 2016 - 2017. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) profiles on selected ESKAPE organisms and E. coli isolated from blood cultures from the public and private sectors in 2016 and 2017 were analysed. AST data were extracted from a web-based electronic platform created by the NICD. Drug-bug combinations following the World Health Organization's Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System guidelines were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 28 920 ESKAPE organisms and E. coli were reported in 2016 and 32 293 in 2017 across the two health sectors. Proportions of some organisms differed between the two health sectors, such as E. coli (19% in the public sector and 36% in the private sector), A. baumannii (14% public and 4% private), P. aeruginosa (7% public and 11% private) and S. aureus (27% public and 17% private). Susceptibility data indicated changing patterns in both sectors towards an increase in non-susceptibility to carbapenems in K. pneumoniae (p&lt;0.01). However, we demonstrated an increase in susceptibility to cloxacillin in S. aureus (p&lt;0.01) in both sectors. CONCLUSIONS: The key clinically important finding is the rapidly decreasing carbapenem susceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae reported in SA, irrespective of sector. In addition, the analysis provides information that could be used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions implemented at a national level under the guidance and direction of the national AMR framework."
25523602,Incidence rates of tuberculosis in chronic hepatitis C infected patients with or without interferon based therapy: a population-based cohort study in Taiwan.,2014,"BACKGROUND: It is debated whether interferon-based therapy (IBT) would affect the incidence of active tuberculosis (TB) among hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients. Although some case reports have demonstrated a possible association, the results are currently inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a nation-wide population study to investigate the incidence of active TB in HCV infected patients receiving IBT in Taiwan. METHODS: This 9-year cohort study was based on the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000) consisting of 1,000,000 beneficiaries randomly selected from all Taiwan National Health Insurance enrollees in 2000 ( >23.7 million). This insurance program covers all citizens in Taiwan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that identified subjects with HCV infection. IBTs were defined as regimens that included interferon alpha, peginterferon alpha2a and peginterferon alpha2b for at least 2 months. Among them, 621 subjects received IBT, and 2,460 age- and gender-matched subjects were enrolled for analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for active TB, and associated confidence intervals (CIs), comparing IBT cohort and untreated cohort. The endpoint in this study was whether an enrolled subject had a new diagnosis of active TB. RESULTS: During the 9-year enrollment period, the treated and untreated cohorts were followed for a mean (+/- SD) duration of 6.97 +/- 0.02 years and 8.21 +/- 0.01 years, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate of active TB during this study period was 0.150 and 0.151 per 100 person-years in the IBT treated and untreated cohorts, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of active TB in either cohort during a 1-year follow-up (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 2.81, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 0.61-12.98) or the long-term follow-up (AHR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.28-3.78). The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that IBT was not a risk factor for active TB . The only risk factor for active TB was the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that IBT is associated with increased hazard of active TB in HCV infected patients in 1-year follow-up; however, the effect sizes were not statistically significant."
41647022,Establishment and validation of a 28-day mortality prediction model based on the lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratio in patients with severe pneumonia.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia (SP) is a common and often fatal disease. Traditional mortality risk assessments rely on complex scoring systems and lack simple, effective biomarkers. This study aims to explore the potential value of the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with severe pneumonia admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, from January 2020 to May 2025. Clinical data, laboratory indicators, and LAR values were collected. Cox regression analysis, the Boruta feature selection algorithm, and various machine learning models were employed for analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day survival status, and the relationship between LAR and mortality risk was evaluated, leading to the development of a prediction model based on LAR. RESULTS: Among the 491 patients, LAR was significantly associated with 28-day mortality risk and was identified as an independent risk factor for death in severe pneumonia. LAR demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC) in predicting mortality, exhibiting a significant nonlinear relationship with 28-day mortality risk. Among several machine learning models constructed using key variables selected by the Boruta algorithm, the random forest (RF) model exhibited the best predictive performance. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value analysis confirmed the dominant role of LAR in the RF model. CONCLUSION: LAR is an effective biomarker with significant clinical value in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. The LAR-based prediction model enhances the accuracy of mortality risk assessment, especially in non-septic patients. Combined with machine learning techniques, LAR offers a novel tool for early clinical risk evaluation and holds promising potential for clinical application."
41476634,Corneal perforation in the setting of NK/T-cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe systemic inflammation caused by pathologic immune dysregulation and resulting in multiorgan destruction(4). While ocular manifestations are recognized in HLH, corneal perforation has not been well-described in published reports. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 26-year-old male who developed a spontaneous corneal perforation in the setting of NK/T-cell lymphoma-associated HLH. The patient was transferred to our hospital with a progressively enlarging fungating facial mass and severe bilateral eyelid edema, as well as fevers, sepsis, pancytopenia and transaminitis. Biopsy of the facial mass was consistent with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), and the patient was diagnosed with HLH presumed secondary to his malignancy. Ophthalmic examination revealed a corneal perforation of his left eye. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was taken to the operating room for repair of the perforation with a corneal patch graft. Postoperative management included topical corticosteroids and antibiotics. After surgery, the patient's left eye visual acuity was 20/100. Three months later, his visual acuity was 20/30 and the corneal patch graft appeared well-healed. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential for HLH to cause corneal perforation as a severe ocular complication. Prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are crucial for optimizing outcomes in such complex cases."
15762931,Tuberculosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: still a problem in the 21st century.,2004,"Allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) recipients have severely impaired cell-mediated immunity as a result of their conditioning regimen, immunosuppressive therapy, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Accordingly, they are susceptible to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Mycobacterial infections can also occur in these patients, although the incidence is not high, even in countries where tuberculosis (TB) is common. We describe four patients from our hospital who developed pulmonary T tuberculous infection in the post-transplant period over a 3-year period. During that time a total of 127 patients have undergone an ASCT, representing an incidence of TB of 2.3%. The pretransplant diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia in three patients and chronic myeloid leukemia in one case. All four patients were treated with a combination of cyclosporine and corticosteroids for acute and/or chronic GVHD. Three of the four patients were born outside Australia, each from an area where TB is endemic. Two patients died within 2 weeks of the commencement of antituberculous therapy, the third is alive and well, and the fourth died of multi-organ failure and sepsis after 4 months in hospital. A higher index of suspicion of previous TB exposure and infection is required in the assessment of ASCT recipients, particularly in those born in areas where TB is common or endemic."
31849243,Hemodynamic Effects of Propofol and Dexmedetomidine in Septic Patients Without Shock.,2020,"Background: Use of nonbenzodiazepine agents propofol and dexmedetomidine are first line for sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU). These agents have been implicated in the development of bradycardia and hypotension in critical illness. Objectives: To compare the development of clinically significant hypotension and/or bradycardia (ie, negative hemodynamic event) in adults with sepsis yet to require vasopressors receiving either propofol or dexmedetomidine for continuous sedation. Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adults with non-vasopressor-dependent sepsis admitted to an ICU at two academic medical centers between July 2013-September 2017. Results: Patients in the propofol (n = 64) and dexmedetomidine (n = 31) groups developed a clinically significant negative hemodynamic event at statistically similar frequencies (34.4% vs 16.1%, P = 0.065). Patients receiving propofol developed a larger degree of hypotension (47.3 vs 34.7 mm Hg reduction, P = 0.031). In multivariable logistic regression modeling, independent predictors of a negative hemodynamic event were a past medical history of chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.17-12.2; P = 0.027) and baseline heart rate (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.10; P = 0.036). Conclusions and Relevance: A minority of patients with sepsis who received either propofol or dexmedetomidine experienced an event. Patients with sepsis without shock receiving continuous infusions of propofol and dexmedetomidine experienced a negative hemodynamic event at similar frequencies, though the degree of hypotension seen with propofol was greater. The clinical significance of these adverse effects requires cautious use in sepsis and further investigation."
20030734,Multiple effects of amprenavir against Candida albicans.,2010,"Secreted aspartyl peptidases (Saps) are virulence attributes produced by Candida albicans that participate in multiple aspects of the fungal biology and pathogenesis. In the present paper, we have shown that amprenavir, a peptidase inhibitor used in HIV chemotherapy, inhibited Sap2 and growth of C. albicans and also promoted ultrastructural alterations. Esterase activity, sterol content, biofilm formation and the expression of surface mannose- and sialic acid-rich glycoconjugates were also reduced by amprenavir."
20031377,The designer proline-rich antibacterial peptide A3-APO is effective against systemic Escherichia coli infections in different mouse models.,2010,"Antimicrobial peptides are considered to be viable alternatives to conventional antibiotics. However, they rarely show systemic efficacy in animal models when added at non-toxic doses. The dimer A3-APO was designed to attack both the bacterial membrane and the Enterobacteriaceae-specific domain of the heat shock protein DnaK in order to reduce toxicity whilst maintaining activity. The peptide exhibited a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 2-128 mg/L against 28 clinical Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, with a median MIC of 30 mg/L. At this concentration, A3-APO was bactericidal to E. coli 5770, a fluoroquinolone-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strain. The No Observed Adverse Effect Limit (NOAEL) at repeated intraperitoneal peptide administration was 20mg/kg. When administered at this dose three times starting immediately after E. coli Neumann infection, A3-APO cured 100% of mice in a standard bacteraemia model used by the pharmaceutical industry. In a more stringent assay, when treatment started after E. coli 5770 bacteraemia had already been established, three doses of 10mg/kg A3-APO prolonged early survival at a rate similar to that of imipenem and reduced the bacterial counts to base level. When the second assay was repeated in kidney clearance conditions resembling those in humans, 10mg/kg A3-APO was as efficacious as imipenem in the long-term. The increased in vivo efficacy compared with the in vitro bactericidal figures can potentially be explained by the generally observable immunostimulatory properties of antimicrobial peptides. Peptide A3-APO shows promising features as a member in our antibiotic arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens."
25572750,Effect of betamethasone in combination with antibiotics on gram positive and gram negative bacteria.,2014,"Betamethasone is an anti-inflammatory steroid drug used in cases of anaphylactic and allergic reactions, of Alzheimer and Addison diseases and in soft tissue injuries. It modulates gene expression for anti-inflammatory activity suppressing the immune system response. This latter effect might decrease the effectiveness of immune system response against microbial infections. Corticosteroids, in fact, mask some symptoms of infection and during their use superimposed infections may occur. Thus, the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sepsis remains extremely controversial. In this study we analyzed the in vitro effect of a commercial formulation of betamethasone (Bentelan) on several Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria of clinical relevance. It was found to be an inhibitor of the growth of most of the strains examined. Also the effect of betamethasone in combination with some classes of antibiotics was evaluated. Antibiotic-steroid combination therapy is, in such cases, superior to antibiotic-alone treatment to impair bacterial growths. Such effect was essentially not at all observable on Staphylococcus aureus or Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS)."
31859766,[Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteria of neonatal sepsis and associated factors].,2019,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases enterobacteria (ESBL-EP) have implications for neonatal morbidity and mortality. AIM: To describe the prevalence of ESBL-EP in neonatal sepsis and associated factors. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from August 2016 to August 2017; newborn babies (NB) hospitalized in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara ""Dr. Juan I. Menchaca"" were included. The ESBL-EP were investigated by double-disk synergy test and its association with clinical and demographic characteristics of the NB. RESULTS: A total of 1,501 hospitalized NB were studied, with an average gestational age of 36.3 weeks. They were diagnosed 196 neonatal sepsis events, the most frequent etiologies were enterobacteria (45.5%). Resistance to ampicilin was found in 88.8% and to broad spectrum cephalosporins in more than 42% of the strains; 22.9% of them were ESBL phenotype. Apgar </= 7 at five minutes of life (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.47-14.6) and gestational age < 37 weeks (OR 5.4; 95% CI 1.04-27.) increase the risk. CONCLUSION: In enterobacteria that cause neonatal sepsis, 22.9% were EP-ESBL; infection was more likely in patients with Apgar </= 7 at five minutes of age and in preterm infants."
41472947,Exogenous Insulin Antibody Syndrome and Subsequent Severe Subcutaneous Insulin Resistance Complicating Type 1 Diabetes.,2026,"A young girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) developed exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAS) characterized by daytime hyperglycemia and ketosis alternating with prolonged severe nocturnal hypoglycemia. EIAS was diagnosed after the exclusion of other causes of hypoglycemia and with confirmation of very high insulin autoantibody levels, high plasma levels of bound insulin, and abnormal insulin clearance. Treatment with different insulin analogues, subcutaneous (SC) insulin pump, immunomodulation using corticosteroids, and intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin were not effective. She responded well to B-lymphocyte depletive therapy (rituximab) with a fall in insulin antibody levels and returned to usual T1D management with a marked improvement in severity of hypoglycemia. One year later she developed hyperglycemia and ketosis and showed no glycemic effect from SC insulin. She became dependent on IV insulin and was diagnosed with severe subcutaneous insulin resistance (SIR). She managed IV insulin at home but developed episodes of sepsis and central line blockage. Many treatment strategies failed, but successful management was finally achieved with the addition of heparin to insulin lispro via SC pump. EIAS and SIR are both extremely rare and, in this case, responded to very different treatment approaches."
19946607,Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the C-reactive protein gene (-286) with susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,2010,"The role of inflammation in malaria pathogenesis is not fully understood, although C-reactive protein (CRP) may have a negative influence on host immunity to infections. An upstream polymorphism, -286 (C > T > A), in the CRP gene is known to influence CRP levels. In this study, a cohort of 192 Sudanese donors, followed for malaria infection for 9 years, had their CRP -286 gene locus genotyped by pyrosequencing. The number of malaria episodes experienced by each individual over the study period was used as an index for malaria susceptibility. The prevalence of the CRP alleles A, C and T were 21%, 52% and 27%, respectively. Importantly, the A-allele, unlike the C- and T-alleles or CRP genotypes, was significantly associated with an increased number of malaria episodes, P = 0.007. The proportion of A-allele carriers among donors not known to have had malaria during the study period was 18%, whereas it was 43% and 63% among donors who had experienced 1-4 and > or =5 malaria episodes, respectively, over the same period (P = 0.002). Furthermore, the A-allele was associated with higher parasite counts. In conclusion, the CRP -286 A-allele was associated with an increased susceptibility to uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria."
25604218,[Negative fluid balance predicts survival in patients with septic shock].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the change of fluid balance in patients with septic shock for seven continuous days and examine its effect on clinical prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted for 105 patients with septic shock admitted into our intensive care unit (ICU) from May 2013 to February 2014. They were divided into non-survivors and survivors. Their baseline data, net balance quantity of fluid for seven continuous days and laboratory results were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Among them, 28 patients died. Duration of mechanical ventilation, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score were all lower in survivors than those in non-survivors (6 d vs 11 d, P = 0.002; 7 d vs 9 d, P < 0.001; 15 vs 19, P = 0.035). Yet hospitalization time in survivors was longer than that in non-survivors (30 d vs 18 d, P = 0.026) . According to trend graph on net balance of each day, the cumulative net negative fluid balance in survivors increased over time while it remained stable in non-survivors. Among seven days, the cumulative net fluid balance at Day 7 was most negatively correlated with survival days (r = -0.278, P = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that SOFA score and cumulative net balance at Day 7 were the independent prognostic risk factors for septic shock. Moreover, at Day 7, no statistically significant inter-group difference existed in serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, PO(2)/FIO(2) and cardiac troponin I levels. But serum total bilirubin in survivors was lower than that in non-survivors (16.0 vs 27.9, P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Cumulative net negative balance quantity of fluid in survivors was much more than that in non-survivors. SOFA score and net balance quantity of fluid at Day 7 were the independent prognostic risk factors for septic shock. Cumulative net fluid balance at Day 7 was most negatively correlated with survival days. No significant inter-group difference existed in organ function at Day 7."
21067029,Acute mesenteric ischemia: experience in a tertiary care hospital.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia is an abdominal catastrophe. This has been described as a complex of diseases rather than a single clinical entity. The incidence in United States is 1 in 1000 hospital admissions. The objective of this descriptive study was to determine the clinical presentations and out come after surgery of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia. It was conducted at Dubai Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. METHODS: All patients having per operative or histopathological diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia from 2002 to 2006 were included. RESULTS: There were 16 patients in all. Their mean age was 51 years, 12 were male and 4 were female. Abdominal pain was present in 16 patients, vomiting in 12 and anorexia in 9 patients. Abdominal tenderness was present in 16 patients, abdominal distension and rebound tenderness in 12 patients. Five patients had hypertension, 4 had myocardial infarction and 4 had diabetes mellitus as risk factors. X-Ray abdomen was done in 13 patients, Ultrasound in 9 and CT Scan in one patient. Resection of bowel was done in 14 patients. Post operatively 5 patients developed pneumonia, 3 had wound dehiscence, 3 had sepsis, and 3 had Lower GI bleeding. Five patients were expired after surgery in the hospital. Four patients were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: We should have a high index of suspicion for mesenteric ischemia in patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention improves the outcome."
31807436,Diarrhea: a missed D in the 4D glucagonoma syndrome.,2019,"Glucagonoma is a rare and slow-growing pancreatic tumor that usually manifests as glucagonoma syndrome. It is mainly characterized by a typical Dermatosis named necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), Diabetes and glucagon oversecretion. Deep vein thrombosis and Depression complete this set. We report the case of an advanced glucagonoma with liver spread, where all these 4D symptoms occurred but a chronic secretory Diarrhea was the most relevant feature. A 65-year-old man was referred to our center to investigate multiple hepatic nodules evidenced by abdominal tomography. He had a recent diagnosis of diabetes and complained of significant weight loss (25 kg), crusted skin lesions and episodes of a large amount of liquid diarrhea during the past 6 months. On admission, there were erythematous plaques and crusted erosions on his face, back and limbs, plus angular cheilitis and atrophic glossitis. The typical skin manifestation promptly led dermatologists to suspect glucagonoma as the source of our patient's symptoms. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a hypervascularized pancreatic lesion and multiple hepatic nodules also hypervascularized in the arterial phase. Despite initial improvement of diarrhea after subcutaneous octreotide, the patient's impaired nutritional status limited other therapeutic approaches and he died of respiratory failure due to sepsis. His high levels of serum glucagon were not yet available so we performed an autopsy, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic glucagonoma with NME on histology. Chronic diarrhea is not a common feature in glucagonoma syndrome; however, its severity can lead to serious nutritional impairment and set a poor outcome."
41517265,Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Steven-Johnson Syndrome During the Postpartum Period: A Literature Review with a Rare Case Presentation.,2025,"Introduction: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are rare yet dangerous dermatological emergencies presenting as necrosis of the skin and mucous membranes due to an immune reaction which may be associated with the use of pharmaceuticals-predominantly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, and antiretroviral drugs. During the postpartum period, women are administered numerous pharmaceuticals, including NSAIDs, analgesics, and antibiotics, due to pain and their susceptibility to infections, exposing them to potential adverse effects including allergies and immune reactions. Case Report and Review: The case reported here is a rare description of a patient in the early postpartum phase who presented with epidermal necrolysis whilst remaining hospitalized after a cesarean delivery. The multidisciplinary approach, early diagnosis, and treatment ensured the patient's full recovery. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment resulted in a rapid therapeutic effect. This literature review offers an insight into the epidemiology, diagnostic process, and treatment of this infrequent dermatological syndrome during the postpartum period. Results: Antibiotic treatment is a common culprit of TEN in this population; hence, clinicians should remain vigilant during antibiotic administration. Differential diagnosis with toxic shock syndrome is crucial, as TEN and SJS symptoms may mimic sepsis, which is a more common diagnosis in the postpartum period. Conclusions: The condition of the skin during the postpartum period should be closely monitored, as some systemic diseases may manifest abruptly as profound, postpartum hormonal changes affect the immunological response. Upon the discovery of suspicious skin lesions concomitant with systemic symptoms, an immediate multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians and dermatologists is key to a rapid diagnosis and treatment to avoid maternal mortality."
31921744,Culture-Negative Streptococcus suis Infection Diagnosed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing.,2019,"Background: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe infections such as meningitis and septicemia in both swine and humans. Rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is very important for guiding clinical choices in administering countermeasures. Case Report: Here, we report a case of fatal S. suis infection in a patient who worked as a butcher in China. The 59-year-old man, who had previously undergone splenectomy, injured his finger while processing pork and developed severe sepsis. While blood cultures were negative following antibiotic treatment, S. suis was determined to be the causative agent by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and Sanger sequencing. Conclusion: Identification of etiological agents using techniques such as blood culture prior to antibiotic treatment is very important. mNGS may represent a useful method for diagnosis of infectious diseases, especially post-antibiotic treatment."
25639174,Role of plain radiography in the assessment of ingested foreign bodies in the pediatric patients.,2015,"Ingestion of various types of foreign bodies (FBs) such as coins, toy parts, jewelry pieces, needles and pins, fish and chicken bones, and button-type batteries is common among children. The curiosity of children and their need to investigate the world around them place them at a higher risk for ingestion of FBs. Fortunately, 80%-90% of ingested foreign objects that reach the stomach will pass uneventfully without intervention. The remainder may become blocked in the esophagus or other region of the alimentary tract, placing the pediatric patient at risk of significant complications such as aspiration, obstruction, bleeding, perforation, fistulization, sepsis, and death. The goals of the initial pediatric patient assessment are to identify the type of object ingested, its location in the gastrointestinal tract, and the presence of associated complications. Factors reported to increase the risk of complications included a sharp FB, a FB with a wide diameter, and symptoms. Plain radiographs still play an important role in the assessment of ingested FBs in the pediatric patient: plain films of the neck, chest, and abdomen are very useful in confirming the diagnosis of FB ingestion because most ingested FBs are radiopaque."
20018492,First-dose and steady-state population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of piperacillin by continuous or intermittent dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis.,2010,"The objectives of this study were (i) to compare the plasma concentration-time profiles for first-dose and steady-state piperacillin administered by intermittent or continuous dosing to critically ill patients with sepsis and (ii) to use population pharmacokinetics to perform Monte Carlo dosing simulations in order to assess the probability of target attainment (PTA) by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for different piperacillin dosing regimens against bacterial pathogens commonly encountered in critical care units. Plasma samples were collected on Days 1 and 2 of therapy in 16 critically ill patients, with 8 patients receiving intermittent bolus dosing and 8 patients receiving continuous infusion of piperacillin (administered with tazobactam). A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM, which found that a two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model best described the data. Total body weight was found to be correlated with drug clearance and was included in the final model. In addition, 2000 critically ill patients were simulated for pharmacodynamic evaluation of PTA by MIC [free (unbound) concentration maintained above the MIC for 50% of the dosing interval (50% f(T>MIC))] and it was found that continuous infusion maintained superior free piperacillin concentrations compared with bolus administration across the dosing interval. Dosing simulations showed that administration of 16g/day by continuous infusion vs. bolus dosing (4g every 6h) provided superior achievement of the pharmacodynamic endpoint (PTA by MIC) at 93% and 53%, respectively. These data suggest that administration of piperacillin by continuous infusion, with a loading dose, both for first dose and for subsequent dosing achieves superior pharmacodynamic targets compared with conventional bolus dosing."
31882569,Legionella Pneumonia in Late Pregnancy.,2019,"BACKGROUND Legionella pneumonia can be an aggressive form of pneumonia. However, it is rare in pregnant women, particularly in the peripartum period. To the best of our knowledge this is the only case of Legionella pneumonia with endometrial sepsis. We are reporting a patient with this rare condition. CASE REPORT The patient was an 18-year-old female, pregnant with her first baby, who developed symptoms of the common cold near term. The patient was seen at another major facility initially and was discharged home with a diagnosis of ""cold"". She was still uncomfortable and came to our facility Aront Ogden Medical Center Elmira, NY, USA, where she had rupture of membranes and underwent C-section. She was suspected clinically of having pneumonia. Initial chest x-ray was negative, but computed tomography (CT)-scan did show bilateral pneumonia. Further workup confirmed the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia and was treated for that as well as for endometritis. She did require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care during her hospital stay. The patient was seen and evaluated by multiple subspecialties, including Critical Care, Infectious Disease, and Gastroenterology subspecialties. The patient improved steadily, and was later discharged home in the care of her family with a healthy baby and was advised to follow up with her Primary Medical Provider as outpatient. CONCLUSIONS Legionella pneumonia in pregnancy may be more common than we think, and could be easily overlooked in that patient population, have to be in the back mind of medical provider. Overlooking diagnosis could lead to serious adverse consequences for these patients."
25895352,[Detection of Staphylococcus aureus toxins using immuno-PCR].,2014,"A highly sensitive test system, based on the method of immuno-PCR, was developed for the detection of two staphylococcal toxins: enterotoxin A (SEA) and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST). A key element of the developed systems was obtaining supramolecular complexes of bisbiotinylated oligodeoxynucleotides and streptavidin, which were used as DNA tags. Specificity studies showed no cross-reactivity when determining SEA and TSST. The sensitivity of detection of these toxins in the culture supernatants S. aureus was not less than 10 pg/mL."
25551203,"Comparison of nested, multiplex, qPCR; FISH; SeptiFast and blood culture methods in detection and identification of bacteria and fungi in blood of patients with sepsis.",2014,"BACKGROUND: Microbiological diagnosis of sepsis relies primarily on blood culture data. This study compares four diagnostic methods, i.e. those developed by us: nested, multiplex, qPCR (qPCR) and FISH with commercial methods: SeptiFast (Roche) (SF) and BacT/ALERT(R) 3D blood culture system (bioMerieux). Blood samples were derived from adult patients with clinical symptoms of sepsis, according to SIRS criteria, hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS: Using qPCR, FISH, SF, and culture, microbial presence was found in 71.8%, 29.6%, 25.3%, and 36.6% of samples, respectively. It was demonstrated that qPCR was significantly more likely to detect microorganisms than the remaining methods; qPCR confirmed the results obtained with the SF kit in all cases wherein bacteria were detected with simultaneous confirmation of Gram-typing. All data collected through the FISH method were corroborated by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR and FISH methods described in this study may constitute alternatives to blood culture and to the few existing commercial molecular assays since they enable the detection of the majority of microbial species, and the qPCR method allows their identification in a higher number of samples than the SF test. FISH made it possible to show the presence of microbes in a blood sample even before its culture."
41640744,Development and validation of a nutrition-integrated nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, necessitating early risk stratification. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for 28-day mortality in sepsis patients incorporating machine learning-selected biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 1,350 sepsis patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training (n = 944) and testing (n = 406) sets. LASSO and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to screen key biomarkers associated with mortality. A logistic regression model was constructed using the selected features, and a nomogram was developed by integrating these biomarkers with APACHE II, SOFA score, and shock status. Model performance was evaluated by AUC, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). External validation was performed in an independent cohort of 120 patients. RESULTS: Six biomarkers consistently selected by both LASSO and RF were: procalcitonin (PCT), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher levels of PCT, ALT, and IBIL, and lower levels of RBC, PLT, and PNI compared to survivors (all P < 0.05). The logistic regression model demonstrated strong discrimination [AUC: 0.841 (95% CI: 0.814-0.868) in training set; 0.808 (95% CI: 0.769-0.847) in testing set]. The nomogram showed good calibration and favorable net clinical benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities. In the external validation cohort, the model maintained excellent predictive performance with an AUC of 0.921 (95% CI: 0.876-0.966). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a clinically useful nomogram incorporating nutrition-related biomarkers, particularly PNI, for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. The model demonstrates robust performance and highlights the importance of nutritional status in sepsis outcomes."
15656340,Nephrotic syndrome and angiotropic lymphoma report of a case.,2004,"A case of angiotropic lymphoma involving renal glomeruli and interstitial vessels associated with nephrotic syndrome and with minor lesions in the glomerular basal membrane is reported. A 56-year-old woman had fever, weakness and clinical findings of a nephrotic syndrome with normal renal function. Renal biopsy revealed that the glomeruli were infiltrated by neoplastic lymphoid cells positive for CD20 and CD45; the glomerular basement membranes showed a pattern of minimal change disease. This case and our review of the literature suggest that the rare association of intravascular lymphoma and glomerular disease is more than coincidental."
25556513,Do leukoreduction filters passively reduce the transmission risk of human granulocytic anaplasmosis?,2015,"BACKGROUND: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis, caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, poses an increasing public health risk in the United States. Since 2000, case reports have increased annually; 2782 cases were reported in 2013. Despite the increasing frequency of clinical cases, only eight cases of transfusion-transmitted anaplasmosis (TTA) have been reported. We investigated if current leukoreduction practices impact transfusion risk. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole blood units (WBUs) with integral red blood cell (RBC) leukoreduction filters were collected and spiked with A. phagocytophilum-infected HL-60 cells equivalent to 0.01, 1, or 5% of total neutrophils. After 24 hours at 4 degrees C WBUs were processed into plasma and RBCs, the latter subsequently leukoreduced (LR RBCs). To evaluate the removal of A. phagocytophilum by filtration, pre- and postfiltration samples were compared by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Compared to Day 0 or Day 1 positive controls, LR RBCs demonstrated reduced levels of A. phagocytophilum by culture and PCR. At 0.01% infection levels LR RBCs yielded no positive cultures and a log reduction of 2.5 by PCR. Similarly, at 1 and 5% infections levels, LR RBCs produced only 44% (4/9) and 56% (5/9) positive cultures, respectively. PCR results were comparable, 3.0 log reduction for 1% and 3.3 log reduction for 5% infection levels. CONCLUSIONS: The recent increase in TTA suggests that A. phagocytophilum may represent an emerging blood safety issue. However, the current study indicates that the widespread practice of leukoreduction might passively reduce, but not eliminate, TTA risk. In the absence of viable testing or pathogen inactivation and/or reduction options, leukoreduction may offer some protection from transmission risk."
32165955,"Correlation of Troponin Level (Troponin T, Troponin I) With PELOD-2 Score in Sepsis as a Predictive Factor of Mortality.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis in children with cardiovascular involvement can increase mortality. Recently, many studies have been conducted to investigate troponin as an early marker of myocardial dysfunction, associated with pediatric sepsis score. Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2) score is recent scoring to assess organ dysfunction in sepsis children. AIM: To determine the correlation between troponin T, troponin I with PELOD-2 score in sepsis as a predictive factor of mortality. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on sepsis children in PICU Haji Adam Malik General Hospital, Medan. Assessment of PELOD-2 score, serum troponin T, and troponin I levels performed on the first day and 48 hours after sepsis was diagnosed. Patients were observed until moved to the ward or died. RESULTS: A group of 41 subjects were recruited in this study. Troponin T level at 24 hours did not correlate with PELOD-2 scores. Troponin T level at 48 hours was positively correlated with PELOD-2 score (r = 0.771, p < 0.001) and had a significant association with the mortality rate (p < 0.001). Troponin T at 48 hours could be used as a predictive factor of mortality (AUC 86.4%, p < 0.001) with a cut-off point of 40.3 ng/mL (76% sensitivity, 75% specificity, RR 2.48). Troponin I levels at 24 and 48 hours also had strong correlation with PELOD-2 score (r = 0.326, p = 0.037; r = 0.691, p < 0.001) and could be used as a predictor of mortality in pediatric patients with sepsis (AUC 74.8%, p 0.008; AUC 92.6%, p < 0.001). The cut-off point of troponin I at 24 hours was 0.075 ng/mL (68% sensitivity, 68.8% specificity, RR 1.84) and at 48 hours was 0.125 ng/mL (80% sensitivity, 81.3% specificity, RR 3.13). CONCLUSION: Serum troponin T and troponin I levels at 48 hours have positive correlation with PELOD-2 score as a predictive factor of mortality in pediatric patients with sepsis."
41424725,Bioinformatics-based identification and validation of mitochondria-related genes associated with neonatal sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: While mitochondrial involvement in sepsis has been widely studied, its role in neonatal sepsis (NESE) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) in NESE using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: This study utilized neonatal sepsis-related datasets GSE69686 and GSE95233. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing NESE and control groups. Subsequently, candidate genes were then selected by intersecting DEGs with MRGs. These candidate genes were further refined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm to identify potential biomarkers. Expression levels and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of the candidate biomarkers were assessed in both datasets. To further investigate their mechanisms, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction analyses were conducted. Finally, biomarker expression was validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 24 candidate genes were obtained by overlapping 579 DEGs and 1,136 MRGs. ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, MTHFD2, PDSS1, and TSPO were identified as biomarkers. The enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of ACSL1, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and TSPO in the lysosome compartment. Moreover, there were significant differences in seven immune cells (M0 macrophage, activated NK cell, neutrophil, etc) between NESE samples and normal samples. Importantly, the correlation analysis revealed that the expression of ACSL1 exhibited a negative correlation with CD8 + T cells, whereas it demonstrated a positive association with neutrophil. Additionally, it also found birch A and Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin simultaneously targeted TSPO, MTHFD2, ALAS1, ALDH5A1, PDSS1, and ACSL1. Importantly, the RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the expression results of PDSS1, TSPO, and ALAS1 were consistent with the public database, showing significantly over-expressed in the NESE group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, six mitochondria-related biomarkers in NESE were identified and preliminarily validated, which may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and serve as a potential basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic exploration."
31806982,Marker Of Sepsis Severity Is Associated With The Variation In Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) During Sepsis Treatment.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: The main pathophysiology of sepsis is considered to be circulation crisis with an imbalance of vasodilation and vasoconstriction mechanisms, which contributes to multiple organ failure. However, sepsis-induced hemodynamic changes have not been fully validated by novel arterial stiffness parameter. The aim of this study was to clarify the acute vascular alteration and hemodynamic change in sepsis using cardio-ankle-vascular index (CAVI). METHODS: Twenty-one Japanese patients (14 males and 7 females, age 62.8 +/- 19.0 years) with sepsis were recruited. CAVI was measured before and 1-week after sepsis treatment. RESULTS: The leading underlying cause of sepsis was pyelonephritis, followed by pneumonia, lung abscess, hepatic abscess and cholecystitis. All subjects recovered from sepsis. Analysis of all subjects showed a significant increase in CAVI after 1-week treatment (7.9 +/- 2.4 to 9.6 +/- 1.8, P < 0.001), but no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was observed. Significant correlations were observed for all combinations among the change in CAVI, systolic BP and ln[procalcitonin (PCT)], respectively. Additionally, in subjects with PCT at presentation >/=2.0 ng/mL, the increase in CAVI after treatment was significantly greater compared to those with PCT < 2.0 ng/mL (2.4 +/- 1.6 vs 1.1 +/- 0.9, P = 0.037). DISCUSSION: CAVI may reflect sepsis-induced vascular alteration which is not indicated by BP change, and is associated with sepsis severity. These findings suggest the usefulness of CAVI in the management of circulatory failure in sepsis patients."
15777063,Emphysematous cystitis: a case report and literature review.,2004,"Emphysematous cystitis (EC), a rare form of cystitis, is often an incidental radiological finding but it can be associated with diffuse abdominal or suprapubic pain. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic infection to fulminant sepsis. We present the case of a 79-year-old woman with diffuse abdominal pain, back pain accompanied with low-grade fevers, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and emesis who was ultimately found to have emphysematous cystitis. A review of the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment options follows."
25573643,Meconial peritonitis in a rare association of partial ileal apple-peel atresia with small abdominal wall defect.,2014,"Intestinal atresia type III B (apple peel) and gastroschisis are both congenital malformations who require early surgical correction in neonatal age. Their association is very rare. We present the case of a full term infant with partial apple peel ileal atresia and a small defect of the anterior abdominal wall, complicated by in utero intestinal perforation and subsequent meconial peritonitis. We observed a partial atresia of small intestine, with involvement of terminal ileus savings of jejunum and a large part of the proximal ileum, small anterior abdominal wall defect with herniation of few bowel loops, intestinal malrotation. Paralytic ileus and infections are the main causes of morbidity and mortality at neonatal age. In our case, in spite of the mild phenotype, prognosis has been complicated by the onset of functional bowel obstruction, caused by chemical peritonitis resulting from contact with either amniotic fluid and meconium."
15590427,Early diagnosis of bacterial infection in the neonate.,2004,"The diagnosis of neonatal bacterial infection remains one of the greatest and most tantalizing challenges to neonatologists. At birth it must be based on the history of pregnancy and take into account a number of now well-defined risk factors. In addition, if promptly started, antibiotic therapy can reduce its sequelae and improve the prognosis. However, the number of tests that obstetricians can rely on for the diagnosis of infection is quite limited. Tests of maternal inflammation indicators have a low specificity, culture tests are not immune from the risk of contamination, and the measurement of interleukins in the amniotic fluid and maternal blood serum is not yet routine. Observation of clinical signs therefore remains crucial to neonatologists, at the same time that new and more sophisticated laboratory tests enable them to establish a diagnosis of infection at an increasingly earlier stage. In recent years, several infection markers have been investigated, such as procalcitonin and especially C-reactive protein (CRP). Currently, the measurement of plasma concentrations of interleukins (IL), IL-6 and IL-8 in particular, appears to be one of the most sensitive and specific infection indicators in newborns. Cytokine levels are increased even before infants develop any clinical symptoms and routine laboratory tests turn positive. However, owing to their short half-life, their sensitivity decreases after 12-24 h from the onset of inflammation, increasing the risk of false negatives. Ideally, they should then be used in combination with other inflammation indicators, such as CRP. The measurement of cytokines and other new inflammatory markers might be helpful in the early diagnosis of both early-onset infection (assay in umbilical cord blood) and late-onset infection (serial assays performed during the stay in the neonatal intensive care unit). In spite of their time-consuming techniques, culture tests remain of the utmost importance to plan a targeted treatment; blood culture, in particular, is crucial to the diagnosis of sepsis."
41468640,Construction and validation of a machine learning-based risk prediction model for invasive mechanical ventilation in AECOPD patients complicated with respiratory failure.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to create and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) complicated by respiratory failure. METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with AECOPD and respiratory failure were retrospectively extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). A total of 551 cases were split 7:3 into a training set (385 cases) for model construction and an internal validation set (166 cases). The IMV served as the outcome event. Features were selected with the Boruta algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Eight ML algorithms-XGBoost, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), LightGBM, CatBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (NN)-were trained with 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. An external validation cohort of 100 AECOPD-respiratory failure patients admitted to Baoying People's Hospital between January 2020 and August 2025 was collected. The final best model was interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to clarify feature importance and decision logic, and an interactive dynamic nomogram was plotted to increase readability. RESULTS: Boruta plus LASSO identified total calcium, partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and sepsis as significant predictors. XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an internal validation accuracy of 72.2%, sensitivity of 64.6%, specificity of 79.8 %, F1 score of 69.7% and AUC of 0.813 (95% CI 0.748-0.878). The external validation accuracy reached 76.4%, the sensitivity reached 82.6%, the specificity reached 70.0%, the F1 score reached 78.7%, and the AUC reached 0.840 (95% CI 0.801-0.879). SHAP analysis further indicated that PO(2) and SpO(2) were the primary drivers of model decisions. An interactive dynamic nomogram was successfully constructed. CONCLUSION: IMV in AECOPD patients with respiratory failure was associated with total calcium, PO(2), and SpO(2) levels and sepsis. The developed XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive value for IMV in this clinical population."
20110062,[Prognostic value of the LRINEC score (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis) in soft tissue infections: a prospective study at Clermont-Ferrand University hospital].,2010,"BACKGROUND: The LRINEC score was developed in a retrospective study in order to distinguish necrotizing fasciitis from severe soft tissue infections using laboratory data. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of the LRINEC score in infectious cellulitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed at the departments of infectious diseases and dermatology of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. The three evaluation criteria were: time from initiation of antibiotics to regression of erythema, duration of fever and occurrence of complications (abscess, surgery, septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, death, transfer to intensive care). Potential predictive variables were: LRINEC score>6 at admission, comorbidities, local appearance, clinical presentation and soft tissue ultrasound results. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. The rate of complications was higher for patients with a LRINEC score>6 (54%) than for patients with a score<6 (12%, P=0.008). However, a LRINEC score>6 on admission was not significantly associated with increased duration of erythema or of fever. Prior lymphoedema was associated with a better prognosis. DISCUSSION: The LRINEC score may be a useful tool for the detection of complicated forms of soft tissue infections. Patients with a LRINEC score>6 on admission should be carefully evaluated (hospitalization, surgical assessment, close monitoring)."
15686635,[Validity of bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of periprosthetic complications in hydroxyapatite-coated total hip arthroplasty].,2004,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy and usefulness of 99Tc-MDP bone scans for the diagnosis of complications associated with hydroxyapatite- coated total hip prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 99Tc-MDP bone scans of 42 hips were taken before revision surgery in 41 patients with ABG 1 prostheses. Of these, 26 patients (27 hips) were included in our study on the basis of the following criteria: at least 23 months between the index surgery and scintigraphic examination and the availability of good quality bone scans. The average patients' age at the time of index and revision operations was 45.3 years (range, 32-57; SD, 6.02) and 50.2 years (36-61; SD, 6.01), respectively. The average time between the index surgery and bone scintigraphy was 50.3 months (23-84; SD, 15.9). Two experienced specialists in nuclear medicine, who were unaware of any clinical conclusions, participated in the study. RESULTS: Pre- and intra-operative findings showed aseptic loosening in three cups (3/27, 11 %) and one stem (1/27, 4 %). Four hips were suspected to have an infection on the basis of the positive results of intra-operative culture. In the diagnosis of aseptic loosening, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of bone scintigraphy were 100 %, 57 %, 62 %, 23 %, and 100 %, respectively, for the ABG I cup and 100 %, 52 %, 54 %, 8 %, and 100 %, respectively, for the ABG I stem. These characteristics were 67 %, 96 %, 93 %, 67 %, and 96 %, respectively, for the ABG I cup, when plain X-ray was used for evaluation of aseptic loosening. Specificity, accuracy and negative predictive value of plain X-ray for ABG I stem aseptic loosening were 100 %, 96 %, and 96 %. Bone scintigraphy gave one false positive result of sepsis; on the other hand, none of the four hips with positive intraoperative culture was diagnosed as septic. DISCUSSION: The fact that 99Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy as a method of diagnosing periprosthetic complications has a high sensitivity and a relatively low specificity has often been discussed in the literature. Currently, there are only a few studies on bone scintigraphy investigations of hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses. Some authors report that a slight increase in peri-prosthetic radionuclide activity may persist for up to 8 years which can explain the problematic accuracy of the technique. CONCLUSIONS: 99Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy is an intermediate useful tool for detecting complications of total hip arthroplasty with hydroxyapatite- coating. A negative bone scan almost always suggested the absence of aseptic loosening. However, the value of a positive result was regarded as controversial for the diagnosis of both aseptic and septic complications."
41408369,Age-related epidemiology and outcomes of sepsis in Japanese critical care units: a nationwide administrative claims database study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The global rise in the elderly population presents unique challenges in intensive care, including treatment decisions and end-of-life care due to physiological, ethical, and social complexities. However, data on the very elderly remain limited, highlighting the need for real-world, large-scale studies. We aimed to characterize the age-related epidemiology and outcomes of sepsis in Japan using a nationwide administrative claims database. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for fiscal years 2010-2019. Sepsis was defined by infection-related ICD-10 codes, blood culture testing, and administration of antimicrobials within a three-day window around admission to critical care unit. Patients were stratified into 10-year age groups, and logistic regression was used to assess the association between age and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 1,880,275 critical care patients with infection-related diagnosis, 511,848 met the sepsis criteria. The median age was 76 years, and 40.0% were aged >/= 80 years. ICU and hospital mortality increased with age, reaching 9.5% and 24.9%, respectively, in patients aged >/= 90 years. Compared to patients aged </= 29 years, those aged >/= 90 had an adjusted odds ratio of 4.75 (95% CI 4.37-5.16) for in-hospital mortality. The proportion of patients discharged home declined with age, falling to 29.4% in the >/= 90 group. Use of organ support, including vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, was inversely related to age. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis in Japanese critical care units demonstrated substantial age-related differences in epidemiology, treatment, resource utilization, and outcomes. The disproportionately high mortality and reduced treatment intensity among the oldest patients underscore the complex clinical and ethical considerations involved in managing sepsis in aging societies. These findings emphasize the urgent need to adapt sepsis care models and critical care resource planning for the rapidly aging population in Japan and similar nations."
41436209,Extensive arterial and venous thrombosis revealing lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with managed comorbidities.,2025,"We present a case of a female in her late 40s with a 5-year history of well-managed type II diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented with acute severe abdominal pain, vomiting and loose stools. Clinical assessment revealed sepsis and metabolic acidosis. Imaging demonstrated extensive arterial and venous thrombosis involving the superior mesenteric artery and vein, as well as the splenic vein. Emergency laparotomy was performed on the same day, revealing gangrenous bowel from the distal jejunum to the mid-transverse colon, necessitating resection and stoma creation. Postoperative management included anticoagulation. Given the unusual presentation of extensive thrombosis in a patient with low traditional risk factors, further investigation was pursued. Chest X-ray and High-resolution CT of the thorax revealed a right lower lobe mass with multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy confirmed primary lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 and CK7 positive). Subsequent positron emission tomography-CT showed widespread metastasis, and the patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy and later underwent jejunocolic anastomosis. This unique case highlights how extensive mesenteric thrombosis can be the initial manifestation of previously undiagnosed lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with otherwise well-managed comorbidities. It underscores the critical importance of considering underlying malignancy in the differential diagnosis of acute thromboembolic events to facilitate early diagnosis and potentially improve patient outcomes."
25523856,Antibiotic therapy and clinical outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bacteraemia.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bacteraemia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We assessed clinical outcomes in patients with PA bacteraemia treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) versus other antibiotics, and monotherapy versus combination, all with proven activity by disc testing without minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with PA bacteraemia in 2007 to 2008 were reviewed for demographic, comorbidity, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included microbiological clearance, clinical response and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Median age for 91 patients was 65 years. Median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score was 30. Monotherapy was used in 77 cases: 42 on ceftazidime, 17 on TZP, 10 on carbapenems, and 8 on other antipseudomonal antibiotics. The 30-day mortality was 20.9%, and similar between ceftazidime and TZP versus other antibiotics respectively. More patients in combination versus monotherapy group had cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and vascular access as source of bacteraemia. Patients on monotherapy had higher 30-day mortality (24.7% vs 0%, P = 0.037). Multivariate analysis identified SAPS II score (OR = 1.097, 95% CI, 1.032 to 1.166, P = 0.003) and cancer (OR = 4.873, 95% CI, 1.235 to 19.223, P = 0.024) as independent predictors of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: TZP appeared to be an effective culture-guided antibiotic for PA bacteraemia. High 30-day mortality in monotherapy might be confounded by comorbidity, illness severity and sample size. Cancer patients and a high SAPS II score were independent predictors of 30-day mortality."

31886613,"The cost of a ""benign"" condition: Healthcare utilization and infectious outcomes in young children with primary autoimmune neutropenia.",2020,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is a common cause of chronic neutropenia in childhood. Despite an expected benign clinical course, many patients undergo extensive evaluation. Data on healthcare utilization and rates of bloodstream infections in young patients with AIN are limited. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis code of leukopenia, neutropenia, or AIN followed within the outpatient hematology clinic of a single institution from 2014 to 2016 were identified. Patients aged </=5 years with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) </=500/microL persisting for >/=3 months, a clinical diagnosis of AIN, and documented resolution of neutropenia were included. Data on clinical management, including infectious outcomes and emergency center (EC) encounters, were collected. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with AIN (18 male [42%], median age at diagnosis 12 months) met eligibility criteria. Children were followed by hematology for a median duration of 18 (range, 2-85) months. Diagnostic evaluations were variable. Thirty patients (70%) had >/= 1 EC encounters for evaluation of isolated fever with a total of 113 EC encounters for the overall cohort. Patients with ANC < 500/microL and isolated fever were admitted for observation, which resulted in 24 hospitalizations in 16 patients. Of 138 blood cultures drawn, two were positive, both later determined to be contaminants. CONCLUSION: At a large tertiary care center, no bloodstream infections were identified in a cohort of 43 children with AIN presenting to the EC for assessment of fever. A less-intensive, more cost-effective management paradigm, which continues to prioritize patient safety, among young children with AIN is needed."
31892315,HMGB1 concentration measurements in trauma patients: assessment of pre-analytical conditions and sample material.,2019,"BACKGROUND: HMGB1 is a mediator of systemic inflammation in sepsis and trauma, and a promising biomarker in many diseases. There is currently no standard operating procedure for pre-analytical handling of HMGB1 samples, despite that pre-analytical conditions account for a substantial part of the overall error rate in laboratory testing. We hypothesized that the considerable variations in reported HMGB1 concentrations and kinetics in trauma patients could be partly explained by differences in pre-analytical conditions and choice of sample material. METHODS: Trauma patients (n = 21) admitted to a Norwegian Level I trauma center were prospectively included. Blood was drawn in K(2)EDTA coated tubes and serum tubes. The effects of delayed centrifugation were evaluated in samples stored at room temperature for 15 min, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h respectively. Plasma samples subjected to long-term storage in - 80  degrees C and to repeated freeze/thaw cycles were compared with previously analyzed samples. HMGB1 concentrations in simultaneously acquired arterial and venous samples were also compared. HMGB1 was assessed by standard ELISA technique, additionally we investigated the suitability of western blot in both serum and plasma samples. RESULTS: Arterial HMGB1 concentrations were consistently lower than venous concentrations in simultaneously obtained samples (arterial = 0.60 x venous; 95% CI 0.30-0.90). Concentrations in plasma and serum showed a strong linear correlation, however wide limits of agreement. Storage of blood samples at room temperature prior to centrifugation resulted in an exponential increase in plasma concentrations after  approximately 6 h. HMGB1 concentrations were fairly stable in centrifuged plasma samples subjected to long-term storage and freeze/thaw cycles. We were not able to detect HMGB1 in either serum or plasma from our trauma patients using western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial and venous HMGB1 concentrations cannot be directly compared, and concentration values in plasma and serum must be compared with caution due to wide limits of agreement. Although HMGB1 levels in clinical samples from trauma patients are fairly stable, strict adherence to a pre-analytical protocol is advisable in order to protect sample integrity. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect HMGB1 utilizing standard western blot analysis."
41401655,Tocilizumab for super-refractory status epilepticus in children with FIRES: A case series.,2026,"PURPOSE: Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy that can occur at any age, with limited treatment options. Conventional immunotherapies often show poor efficacy. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the interleukin-6 receptor blocker, tocilizumab, in children with FIRES. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging of seven children with FIRES treated at our center between 2018 and 2022. Outcomes included cessation of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), seizure burden, and functional outcome using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scale. RESULTS: Seven previously healthy children (median age 9 years; range 2-13) developed SRSE following febrile illness. Extensive investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid studies, viral panels, and autoimmune testing were negative, consistent with cryptogenic FIRES. Initial MRI was normal in six children; one showed symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving deep grey matter structures. All patients received a multimodal therapeutic strategy including intravenous midazolam, high-dose phenobarbitone, ketogenic diet, therapeutic hypothermia, and/or immunotherapy-prior to tocilizumab. Intravenous tocilizumab was initiated at a median of 17 days from illness onset (range 6-46). SRSE resolved within a median of 5 days (range 2-12) after administration. At 6-month follow-up, six of seven patients developed chronic epilepsy, characterised by weekly to monthly seizures, while one remained seizure free. Functional recovery was noted in four patients, each achieving a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score of </=2. Adverse events included grade 2 leukopenia or diarrhoea (n = 3) and grade 4 sepsis (n = 1); all resolved with treatment. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab was associated with rapid resolution of SRSE, seizure reduction, and functional recovery in children with FIRES, with manageable side effects. While causality cannot be confirmed given concurrent therapies and variable timing of administration, these findings support consideration of interleukin-6 blockade as a potential adjunctive treatment in FIRES."
20120401,"Cerebral palsy: early diagnosis, intervention and risk factors.",2009,"Early diagnosis and intervention intensity were suggested to be crucial factor in cerebral palsy (CP) treatment. Herein we observed 347 children diagnosed for CP in Clinical Hospital Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and studied the relationship between (a) intervention start point and the final motor outcome, (b) intensity of treatment and final outcome, and (c) relationship between documented risk factors and early diagnosis of the CP. Our study suggests that it is possible to relatively accurately diagnose the CP in the first trimester. Previous miscarriages, sepsis and intracerebral haemorrhage were significantly related to early diagnosis, while delivery outcome, RDS, premature birth, intracerebral haemorrhage, sepsis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and convulsions were found as significantly related to final motor CP outcome. We have found no significant influence of the intervention intensity and final diagnosis. Our results support the idea that the intervention start point has to be considered as one of the most important factors for the effective intervention program. In future studies dealing with the CP interventions and risk factors, special attention should be paid to homogeneity and size of the sample, as well as necessity of including the non-treated controls in the investigation."
32550331,An outcome analysis of videoscopic assisted retroperitoneal debridement in infected pancreatic necrosis: a single centre experience.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a dreadful complication of moderately severe and severe acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). Videoscopic assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) is a minimally invasive surgical option for predominantly left sided, posterior and laterally located disease in patients not responding to conservative and percutaneous options. This study aimed to present an outcome analysis of VARD in the management of IPN at our tertiary care centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present retrospective analysis of prospectively entered data included 22 patients diagnosed as ANP with IPN from January 2015 to December 2017. These patients were admitted in the surgical gastroenterology unit of our tertiary care centre. The outcome of these patients managed with VARD was evaluated. RESULTS: The aetiology of ANP was idiopathic, and gallstones were found in 7 patients each and alcohol in 8. Twelve patients were managed with a single VARD procedure; whereas, 10 required a re-debridement due to suboptimal improvement. Eighteen out of 22 patients survived whereas 4 succumbed to major postoperative bleeding/severe sepsis and multiorgan failure (Mortality 18.2%). Hospital stay after the index procedure was between 6 to 11 weeks. CONCLUSION: VARD is a safe and effective surgical option for the management of IPN that worsens or fails to respond to conservative and percutaneous drainage options after a minimum of 4 weeks of moderately severe and severe ANP. It decreases postoperative morbidity and mortality and avoids major laparotomy, and hence, it can be considered in a selected group of patients."
31867000,Arid5a Regulation and the Roles of Arid5a in the Inflammatory Response and Disease.,2019,"Abnormal gene expression patterns underlie many diseases that represent major public health concerns and robust therapeutic challenges. Posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is well-recognized, and the biological functions of RBPs have been implicated in many diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. However, a complete understanding of the regulation mediated by several RBPs is lacking. During the past few years, a novel role of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5a (Arid5a) as an RBP is being investigated in the field of immunology owing to binding of Arid5a protein to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Il-6 mRNA. Indeed, Arid5a is a dynamic molecule because upon inflammation, it translocates to the cytoplasm and stabilizes a variety of inflammatory mRNA transcripts, including Il-6, Stat3, Ox40, T-bet, and IL-17-induced targets, and contributes to the inflammatory response and a variety of diseases. TLR4-activated NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways are involved in regulating Arid5a expression from synthesis to degradation, and even a slight alteration in these pathways can lead to intense production of inflammatory molecules, such as IL-6, which may further contribute to the development of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This review highlights the regulation of the Arid5a expression and function. Additionally, recent findings on Arid5a are discussed to further our understanding of this molecule, which may be a promising therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases."
41436719,Acute kidney injury prediction and prognostication using machine learning.,2025,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a major health concern with high costs and poor outcomes, partly due to late diagnosis. This paper reviews the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to overcome these limitations by enabling earlier and more accurate prediction and prognostication of AKI. Many studies on AI and ML models used to predict and prognosticate AKI were included in the review. The focus was on models that analyze complex datasets, including real-time data streams like novel biomarkers and continuous vital signs, to achieve earlier and more accurate predictions than conventional methods. ML models show high predictive accuracy for AKI onset and outcomes across various clinical settings, including intensive care units, sepsis, and postoperative and postcontrast situations, with key findings like the successful integration of real-time data to reflect the evolving nature of kidney injury. AI and ML offer a powerful, proactive solution for AKI management. By leveraging diverse data, these technologies can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. While their promising performance warrants further exploration, successful clinical integration will require user-friendly platforms and continued validation."
25667179,Sepsis in vulnerable populations.,2014,"Despite the acquisition of a large body of evidence, there are many unanswered questions about sepsis. The definition of this disease is plagued by the lack of a simple pathophysiological description linking cause to effect and the activation of host immune responses that hinders disease progression at the same time producing multiorgan dysfunction. A plethora of inconsistent clinical features has served to obfuscate rather than illuminate. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines (SSG) are a major advance because it comprehensively interrogates all aspects of care for the critically ill. For vulnerable populations living in low- and middle-income countries, this guideline is ineffectual because of the lack of region-specific data, differences in etiology of sepsis and burden of disease, limited human capacity and infrastructure, as well as socioeconomic realities. Appropriate care must be guided by common sense guidelines that are sensitive to local realities and adapted as relevant data are acquired."
19961971,The enigma of the H1N1 flu: are you ready?,2009,"This flu season, health care providers must be prepared to treat patients who have the seasonal flu and also those who have contracted a novel strain of the H1N1 influenza virus. Although H1N1 flu is sometimes incorrectly called ""swine flu,"" the virus is transmitted from person to person; it cannot be contracted from pigs or from eating pork products. Symptoms of the H1N1 flu include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, body aches, lethargy, and fatigue, which usually appear in rapid succession. People at high risk include children, pregnant women, and those with certain medical conditions. The most common cause of death from the virus is respiratory failure, but other causes of mortality include sepsis, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The first line of defense against H1N1 flu is vaccination. Treatment includes use of antiemetics, antipyretics, and respiratory support."
41444997,Investigating risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community acquired pneumonia: a model for using only electronic data capture.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America community acquired pneumonia guidelines recommend empiric coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on previous respiratory isolation, recent IV antibiotic use, and locally validated risk factors. This study aims to describe how local risk factors may be determined efficiently using data retrieved electronically. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study focused on the time period May 13, 2020, through June 30, 2024. Consecutive adults admitted to one of five acute care facilities with confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were included. Community-acquired pneumonia was defined as the presence of one or more pneumonia diagnosis codes and an order for a respiratory culture or an antimicrobial with the indication of pneumonia or sepsis, 24 h before or within 48 h after the date and time of admission. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis code for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, any subsequent admission in the study period, or if they had a previous respiratory culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa within a year of admission. The causative pathogen and the presence or absence of evaluated risk factors were electronically abstracted from billing data and health records. Serial quality assessments of electronic data were performed to improve accuracy until a well validated population was determined. RESULTS: There were 4,558 unique patients included. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rates were 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Only age was inversely associated with risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). No significant risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found. CONCLUSIONS: In rural or otherwise resource limited healthcare settings, risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia may be determined using only electronic data capture and the methodology described in this article."
41402726,Comparison of invasive and noninvasive blood pressure measurements in critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Blood pressure monitoring is crucial in critically ill patients, with invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP) recognized as the gold standard. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) is widely used but may differ from IABP, particularly in patients receiving norepinephrine. This study evaluated the agreement between IABP and NIBP and the impact of the norepinephrine dosage on the accuracy of NIBP in septic shock patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a 36-bed ICU (April 2022-April 2023) and included 84 patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine. IABP was measured via a radial artery catheter, and NIBP was recorded simultaneously from the contralateral arm. Patients were grouped by norepinephrine dose: </= 0.25, 0.25-0.50, and >/= 0.50 mcg/kg/min. Agreement was assessed via Bland-Altman and error grid analyses, with a focus on the mean blood pressure (MBP) thresholds (>/= 65 mmHg and < 65 mmHg). RESULTS: Among the 2,104 paired measurements, significant discrepancies were observed between the IABP and NIBP across all dose groups(p < 0.001). Discrepancies increased with higher norepinephrine doses, particularly at an MBP >/= 65 mmHg, with biases of -3.89 mmHg (</= 0.25 mcg/kg/min) and - 6.81 mmHg (>/= 0.50 mcg/kg/min). Error grid analysis revealed that 47.2% of MBP >/= 65 mmHg measurements fell into clinically significant risk zones (B-E) at high doses. In patients aged > 65 years, significant differences were observed in all pressures (p < 0.001), whereas younger patients showed discrepancies only in the mean and diastolic pressures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant discrepancies between IABP and NIBP in critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine, particularly at higher doses and in patients with MBP >/= 65 mmHg. These findings highlight the limitations of NIBP monitoring in this population and support the importance of IABP monitoring in selected high-risk patients, while suggesting that NIBP monitoring may remain acceptable in more hemodynamically stable individuals. Applying these considerations in clinical practice may help optimize blood pressure monitoring strategies in the ICU."
25675687,Initial dosage regimen of vancomycin for septic shock patients: a pharmacokinetic study and Monte Carlo simulation.,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin in septic shock patients and to determine the vancomycin dosage to achieve requisite pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target against methicillin resistant Staphylocccus aureus (MRSA) in patients with septic shock. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin in 12 septic shock patients were assessed. Then, the Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate the probabilities of target attainment (PTAs) to reach target AUC0-24/MIC of 400 and 450 mg.h/L. RESULTS: The total clearance (CL) and the volume of the central compartment (Vc) of vancomycin was 3.34+/-1.39 L/h and 0.14+/-1.43 L/kg, respectively. For Staphylococcalspp. with low MICs of 0.125 and 0.5 mg/L, the administration of vancomycin 30 mg/kg as the loading dose, followed by the maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg every six, eight, 12, and 24 hours achieved >90% PTAs to reach target AUC0-24/MlC: For pathogens with MIC of 1, and 1.5 mg/L, the vancomycin maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg every six, eight, and 12 hours and every six and eight hours respectively to achieve >90% PTA. CONCLUSION: High dose ofvancomycin is required to achieve PK/PD target for treatment of MRSA septic shock, especially if MRSA MIC is higher than 1 mg/L."

15697090,Dyserythropoiesis in 105 patients with visceral leishmaniasis.,2004,"Hematologists in the developing world are increasingly involved in diagnosing parasitic diseases that involve the bone marrow. With a worldwide annual incidence of half a million cases and 12 million infected people, visceral leishmaniasis is one such serious disease. It mainly affects malnourishedand economically underprivileged children. Recently, this disease has been seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients and in travelers to endemic areas. Over an 18-year period, 442 marrow examination requests were received by our department, and 105 cases of visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed from findings of Leishman-Donovan bodies. Prominent nuclear dyserythropoiesis was shown in 17 patients, 14 of whom had the frank type that is uniquely seen in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II. Most of these cases showed an extremely low degree of marrow parasitemia. This degree of nuclear dyserythropoiesis was not found in the majority of the marrows in which parasites were more easily detected. There is a direct and negative correlationbetween frank nuclear dyserythropoiesis and marrow parasitemia. Extended microscopical examination is recommended for the detection of Leishman-Donovan bodies in cases of suspected visceral leishmaniasis when frank dyserythropoiesis is a prominent feature. It is possible that both frank nuclear dyserythropoiesis and marrow parasitemia are etiologically under the influence of a common chemokine or cytokine."
27011501,Procalcitonin Strip Test as an Independent Predictor in Acute Pancreatitis.,2015,"Plasma procalcitonin (PCT) is a highly specific marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infection and sepsis. Studies have demonstrated its role in the setting of sepsis and acute pancreatitis. This study aims to analyze and compare the prognostic efficacy of plasma procalcitonin strip test in acute pancreatitis. A prospective study was conducted in the department of general surgery from June 2012 to June 2013. Plasma procalcitonin was estimated by the semiquantitative strip test. The study included a total of 50 patients diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis. Data was collected and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17. Thirty-nine out of the 50 patients (78 %) were males with a mean age of 46.8 years (range, 25-78 years) and 25 patients (50 %) had ethanol-induced pancreatitis, while 13 patients (26 %) had gall stone pancreatitis. Plasma PCT values were found to correlate better than CRP levels and total leukocyte count with the total duration of hospitalization, ITU, and ICU stay, as well as with the progression to severe acute pancreatitis. A cut off for plasma PCT of >2 ng/mL was found to be 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific and a cut off for CRP of >19 mg/dL was 70 % sensitive and 65 % specific for predicting the progression to severe acute pancreatitis. Plasma PCT also correlated well with antibiotic requirement. A cut off value of >0.5 ng/mL for plasma PCT was 100 % sensitive and 80 % specific and a cut off value of >18 mg/dL for CRP was 86 % sensitive and 63 % specific for predicting antibiotic requirement. Plasma procalcitonin is an early and reliable prognostic indicator in acute pancreatitis. The procalcitonin strip test is a rapid test which is useful in analyzing prognosis in patients with acute pancreatitis."
19951384,Recombinant activated protein C treatment improves tissue perfusion and oxygenation in septic patients measured by near-infrared spectroscopy.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose was to test the hypothesis that muscle perfusion, oxygenation, and microvascular reactivity would improve in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock during treatment with recombinant activated protein C (rh-aPC) (n = 11) and to explore whether these parameters are related to macrohemodynamic indices, metabolic status or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Patients with contraindications to rh-aPC were used as a control group (n = 5). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were sedated, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and hemodynamically monitored with the PiCCO system. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during the vascular occlusion test (VOT). Baseline StO2 (StO2 baseline), rate of decrease in StO2 during VOT (StO2 downslope), and rate of increase in StO2 during the reperfusion phase were (StO2 upslope) determined. Data were collected before (T0), during (24 hours (T1a), 48 hours (T1b), 72 hours (T1c) and 96 hours (T1d)) and 6 hours after stopping rh-aPC treatment (T2) and at the same times in the controls. At every assessment, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were registered and the SOFA score calculated. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 26.3 +/- 6.6 and 28.6 +/- 5.3 in rh-aPC and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in macrohemodynamic parameters between the groups at all the time points. In the rh-aPC group, base excess was corrected (P < 0.01) from T1a until T2, and blood lactate was significantly decreased at T1d and T2 (2.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.05). In the control group, base excess was significantly corrected at T1a, T1b, T1c, and T2 (P < 0.05). The SOFA score was significantly lower in the rh-aPC group compared with the controls at T2 (7.9 +/- 2.2 vs. 12.2 +/- 3.2; P < 0.05). There were no differences between groups in StO2 baseline. StO2 downslope in the rh-aPC group decreased significantly at all the time points, and at T1b and T2 (-16.5 +/- 11.8 vs. -8.1 +/- 2.4%/minute) was significantly steeper than in the control group. StO2 upslope increased and was higher than in the control group at T1c, T1d and T2 (101.1 +/- 62.1 vs. 54.5 +/- 23.8%/minute) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with rh-aPC may improve muscle oxygenation (StO2 baseline) and reperfusion (StO2 upslope) and, furthermore, rh-aPC treatment may increase tissue metabolism (StO2 downslope). NIRS is a simple, real-time, non-invasive technique that could be used to monitor the effects of rh-aPC therapy at microcirculatory level in septic patients."
25531172,High cutoff membrane to reduce systemic inflammation due to differentiation syndrome: a case report.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Differentiation syndrome is a life-threatening complication of therapy that is carried out with agents used for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Its physiopathology comprehends the production of inflammatory mediators by differentiating granulocytes, endothelial and alveolar cells due to stimulation by all-trans retinoic acid and leading to sustained systemic inflammation. METHODS: Treatment with high cut-off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (HCO-CVVHD) was performed to reduce the circulating mediators of systemic inflammation. RESULTS: After 52 h of treatment, an important reduction was observed in inflammatory mediators (IL-1beta: from 10 to 2 pg/ml; IL-8: from 57 to 40 pg/ml; TNF-alpha: from 200 to 105 pg/ml; IL-6: from 263 to 91 pg/ml), as well as in anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10: from 349 to 216 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: HCO-CVVHD should be explored as a part of treatment in systemic inflammation states other than sepsis (e.g., differentiation syndrome). Furthermore, its immunomodulatory effects could be particularly useful in immunocompromised patient treated with corticosteroids."
32782464,The challenge of recognising sepsis: Future nanotechnology solutions.,2020,"The urgent need to start anti-infective therapeutic interventions in suspected sepsis, and the lack of specific time-critical diagnostic information often lead to the widespread administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies, increasing the risk of unwanted patient harms and contributing to rising pathogen antimicrobial resistance. Nanotechnology, which involves engineering at the nanoscale, allows for the bespoke development of diagnostic solutions with multi-functionality and high sensitivity that has the potential to help provide time-critical information to make more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions for sepsis. Nanotechnologies also have the potential to improve upon the current strategies used for novel biomarker discovery. Here we describe some of the current limitations to identifying sepsis and explore the potential role for nanotechnology solutions."
41456572,Dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio for infection diagnosis and mortality risk stratification in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Two crucial needs persist in delivering effective critical care: reliable differentiation of infectious vs non-infectious systemic inflammation and detection of impending sepsis before the occurrence of organ dysfunction. This prospective cohort study evaluates the clinical utility of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) biomarker CD177/CD10 ratio to differentiate and monitor infections. METHODS: A total of 219 healthy volunteers and 145 patients were assigned to four clinically defined groups: healthy controls (HC), non-infectious inflammation (NI), non-septic infection (NS-I), and sepsis (S). Serial flow cytometric analysis of CD177 and CD10 expression in PMNs was conducted with longitudinal monitoring. Diagnostic efficacy was standardised against conventional biomarkers and organ dysfunction indices. A dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system (rising/declining/stable pattern) was established for prognostic stratification. FINDINGS: The CD177/CD10 ratio exhibited superior diagnostic performance in infection identification. At a cut-off point (CFP) of 6.07, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the ratio to differentiate NS-I from S was 0.92, exceeding those of CRP (0.85) and PCT (0.85). Notably, this biomarker effectively differentiated NI (CFP = 0.67, AUC = 0.79) from NS-I (CFP = 0.98, AUC = 0.71). The dynamic CD177/CD10 ratio-based subtyping system showed robust prognostic efficacy: patients with the rising subtype exhibited a 7-day mortality rate of 62.5%, while those with decreasing and stable subtypes demonstrated survival rates of 85% and 92.59%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The CD177/CD10 ratio can facilitate infection-specific differentiation and real-time therapeutic monitoring by quantifying the dynamic equilibrium between the extent of neutrophil activation and maturation. However, the CD177/CD10 ratio still requires validation through a multi-centre trial to confirm the generalisability of the established diagnostic and prognostic thresholds.

41662731,"Neonatal Sepsis: Etiology, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, and Treatment Outcomes in a Tertiary Hospital in Jos, Nigeria.",2026,"Sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Current knowledge of etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and outcomes provides evidence for judicious antimicrobial use. The aim for the present study was to identify etiologic organisms, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment outcomes at a tertiary hospital in Jos, Nigeria. A retrospective case review of neonates hospitalized for sepsis was conducted between August 25, 2017 and December 31, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 1,984 neonates admitted, of whom 516 (26%) were diagnosed with neonatal sepsis (NNS). The clinical and blood culture data were available for 380 (74%) neonates, of whom 226 (60%) were male. The majority (63%) were diagnosed with early-onset sepsis, of whom 146 (38%) had severe sepsis. The mean age of the mothers was 29.5 +/- 5.5 years. Of the 207 cultures obtained, 87 (43%) yielded pure isolates, with 50 (58%) of these being Gram-positive. For neonates born outside the study hospital, 6/36 (17%) were methicillin-sensitive, compared with 6/44 (14%) neonates born at the study hospital. Gram-negative isolates, predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae, grew in 36 (41%) of all positive cultures (27/87; 31%). More organisms were sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam (19/19; 100%), gentamicin (21/27; 78%), imipenem (4/8; 50%), and ceftazidime (17/28; 61%) than to the other antibiotics tested. Mortality in all patients with proven or presumed NNS was 31/380 (8%), with increased mortality in those without cultures (8/71; 11% versus 39/71; 55%). Neonatal sepsis-related mortality is high in the study center in Jos, Nigeria. Additional work is needed to mitigate NNS mortality and the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance."
41602112,"Risk factors, and outcomes of patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bloodstream infection: an eight-year case-case-control study.",2025,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (CRE-BSI) represents a major and urgent challenge to global public health. Some patients with CRE-BSI have a greater risk for poor clinical outcomes, thus identifying risk factors for CRE-BSI is required to determine the most at-risk populations. Here, we investigated risk factors for CRE-BSI by conducting a retrospective case-case-control study at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, between 2017 and 2024. A total of 144 patients with CRE-BSI were enrolled in this case-case-control study. Each case was matched simultaneously to a patient with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacterales BSI (CSE-BSI) and a control patient with non-Enterobacterales bacteremia in a 1:1:1 ratio. This design facilitated the analysis of risk factors and a comparison of 30-day survival outcomes among groups. Multivariable logistic regression identified distinct risk factor profiles for different infections. Surgical history emerged as an independent risk factor for Enterobacterales-BSI. Independent risk factors for CRE-BSI encompassed prior exposure to third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.94), carbapenems (OR = 3.45), quinolones (OR = 2.54), and glucocorticoids (OR = 2.55), in addition to a history of surgery (OR = 2.44) and gastric tube insertion (OR = 2.45). In-hospital mortality for CRE-BSI reached 52.8%. Furthermore, arterial catheter use (OR = 2.50) was identified as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients with CRE-BSI. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed several independent predicators of 30-day mortality: patient group (HR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.86; p = 0.04), age >/= 65 years (HR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.93; p = 0.03), respiratory diseases (HR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.54-6.51; p = 0.002), and digestive system diseases (HR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.10; p = 0.04). Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of underlying diseases, antibiotic usage, and invasive procedures is required to reduce CRE-BSI-associated mortality. Given the notable morbidity and mortality, as well as constrained therapeutic options, associated with CRE-BSI, identifying risk factors for CRE-BSI is urgently required for effective disease prevention and to develop novel therapeutic strategies."
25731309,[Therapeutic strategy for perforated colorectal cancer].,2014,"A total of 37 patients were surgically treated for a colorectal perforation between May 2006 and December 2013. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those with perforation due to colorectal cancer(colorectal cancer group, n=12) and those with perforation due to benign colorectal disease(non-colorectal cancer group, n=25). We examined the influence that onset near the perforation had on colorectal cancer clinical outcome. There was no significant difference in patient backgrounds between the two groups. In the colorectal cancer group, curative resections were performed in eight of the cases (67%), while there were 7 cases (58%) of regional lymph node dissection and all patients received a stoma without bowel anastomosis. In the colorectal cancer group, 1 patient (8%) died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, whereas 2 patients (8.3%) in the non-colorectal cancer group died of sepsis after surgery. Nine of those patients (75%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Four patients survived without recurrence. Prompt judgment of the disease severity and selection of optical surgical procedures including tumor resection and regional lymph node dissection is important for colorectal cancer perforation, and an adjuvant setting for the purpose of the long-term survival is necessary."
26201326,Bacterial infections in cirrhosis.,2014,"Bacterial infections occur in 25-35 % of cirrhotics admitted to hospital. Health-care associated and hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections are the most common epidemiology, with community acquired infections less common (15-30 %). Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and urinary infections are the most common sites, with spontaneous bacteremia, pneumonia, cellulitis and other sites being less common. The risk of infection is increased among subjects with more severe liver disease and an infection in the past 6 months. Bacteria are isolated from approximately half of patients with a clinical diagnosis of infection. Gram-negative enterobacteriaceae are the most common organisms among community acquired infections; Gram-positive cocci are the most common organisms isolated among subjects with nosocomial infections. Up to 30 % of hospital associated infections are with multidrug resistant bacteria. Consequently, empiric antibiotic therapy that is recommended for community acquired infections is often inadequate for nosocomial infections. Infections worsen liver function. In-hospital and 1-year mortality of cirrhotics with infections is significantly higher than among cirrhotics without infection. In-hospital complications of infections, such as severe sepsis and septic shock, and mortality, are increased among subjects with multidrug-resistant infections as compared with cirrhotics with susceptible bacteria. Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis of cirrhotics with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis of selected cirrhotics with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis reduces infections and improves survival. Albumin administration to cirrhotics with SBP and evidence of advanced liver disease improves survival. The benefit of albumin administration to cirrhotics with infections other than SBP is under investigation."
15599650,Accuracy of identification and susceptibility results by direct inoculation of Vitek 2 cards from positive BACTEC cultures.,2004,"Rapid identification of bacteria and prompt acquisition of susceptibility results are valuable for patient care. The objective of the present study was to determine the accuracy of direct inoculation of Vitek 2 cards from positive BACTEC cultures compared to inoculation of the cards from subculture plates. Positive BACTEC cultures sampled between March 2001 and June 2002 were included. The results of direct inoculation were compared with the results of inoculation of Vitek 2 cards from subcultures. Of 161 gram-negative bacilli, 129 (80%) were correctly identified by direct inoculation compared to 145 of 161 (90%) by subculture. Susceptibility testing was performed on 2,862 antibiotic-isolate combinations. The essential agreement was 98.7%. The number of very major, major, and minor errors was 1 (0.2% of resistant strains), 1 (0.04% of susceptible strains), and 68, respectively. Direct identification of Staphylococcus spp. was not performed, but antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using 6,042 antibiotic-isolate combinations. The essential agreement was 95.2%. The number of very major, major, and minor errors was 73 (4.5% of resistant strains), 32 (0.8% of susceptible strains), and 106, respectively. Eighty-four percent of the very major errors occurred with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The results show that direct inoculation of Vitek cards is valuable as a rapid routine method for identification and susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli. For Staphylococcus spp., the susceptibility results obtained after direct inoculation of Vitek 2 cards are also acceptable except for those obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Susceptibility results for this antibiotic, if obtained using direct inoculation, should not be reported to the clinician."
15578245,Intraperitoneal treatment of incisional and umbilical hernias using an innovative composite mesh: four-year results of a prospective multicenter clinical trial.,2005,"Intraperitoneal positioning of conventional parietal mesh provides efficient reconstruction but causes visceral adhesion formation in 80-100% of the cases. The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the performance and tolerance of a new generation of polyester mesh protected by a hydrophilic resorbable film. Eighty patients were included in a prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patients were treated for ventral hernia via an open approach (64%) or laparoscopically (36%). All meshes were implanted in a midline intraperitoneal location. The main objective was to evaluate the anti-adhesive capability of the mesh in relation to the viscera. In order to assess the absence of visceral adhesion objectively, an ultrasound (US) specific examination was initially validated (pre-operative prediction vs. per-operative findings) and then used during the follow-up. The usual clinical parameters were also collected to follow the patients on a period up to 4 years. Pre-operative US prediction vs. per-operative macroscopic findings: sensitivity 79%, overall accuracy 76%, negative predictive value 85%. After 12 months, 86% of the patients were ultrasonically adhesion free. Early post-operative complications were: seroma/hematoma (16%), subcutaneous infection (4%), cutaneous necrosis (1%) and occlusions (outside the mesh) (2.5%). No mortality was reported. Clinically, after 12-month follow-up, no complication related to post-operative adhesions to the mesh was noted: (occlusion 0%, fistula 0%). Late complications were: mesh sepsis (1%), new defects (4%) and recurrence (2.5%). Finally, 56 patients (75.7%) were clinically evaluated with a mean follow-up of 48+/-6 months. One direct recurrence was noted while six patients experienced new defect outside the mesh. No long-term severe complication such as occlusion or enterocutaneous fistula was observed. Based on a mean clinical follow-up of 4 years, the results of this prospective multicenter clinical trial demonstrate the safety and the efficiency of this composite mesh in the intraperitoneal treatment of incisional and umbilical hernia. In particular there was no early or long-term main complication due to the intraperitoneal location of the mesh."
41456980,Risk of endocarditis in patients with bacteraemia by coagulase-negative staphylococci; a multicenter retrospective cohort.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious and under-recognized complication of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteraemia. The aim was to identify predictors of IE in patients with CoNS bacteraemia and to compare the diagnostic performance of different Duke criteria versions. METHODS: We retrospectively included adult patients with CoNS bacteraemia (January 2015-June 2024) from two Swiss university hospitals. Each episode was classified according to the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), 2023 ESC, and 2023 International Society of Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) Duke criteria. IE diagnoses were established by the Endocarditis Teams or expert clinicians. RESULTS: Among 466 episodes, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent pathogen (360; 77 %), followed by S. lugdunensis (47; 10 %). IE was diagnosed in 106 (23 %) episodes. Multivariable logistic regression identified non-nosocomial acquisition (aOR 6.43; 95 % CI 2.97-13.9), presence of intracardiac prosthetic material (15.4; 6.77-34.8), sepsis (2.34; 1.10-5.00), S. lugdunensis (2.99; 1.06-8.43), persistent bacteraemia for >/=48 h (6.88; 3.14-15.1), and embolic events (58.3; 21.2-160.5) as predictors of IE. The 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria demonstrated the highest sensitivity (76 %) but lower specificity (61 %) than the 2015 Duke-ESC (sensitivity 21 %, specificity 98 %) and 2023 Duke-ESC (sensitivity 25 %, specificity 96 %) criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In episodes with CoNS bacteraemia, IE should be strongly suspected in those with persistent bacteraemia, prosthetic intracardiac material, non-nosocomial onset, S. lugdunensis bacteraemia, embolic complications. While the 2023 ISCVID criteria improve sensitivity, their lower specificity highlights the need for further refinement of diagnostic algorithms."
25539190,Metabolic endotoxaemia--a potential novel link between ovarian inflammation and impaired progesterone production.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: Medical conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease are associated with impaired luteal function, menstrual disturbance and infertility. It is proposed that the disturbance in gut wall integrity (""leaky gut"") seen in these conditions may result in the passage of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) from the colonic lumen into the circulation that may initiate inflammation in the ovary and subsequently impair hormone production. METHODS: Quantify the association between systemic levels of LBP, a marker of endotoxin exposure, and levels of inflammation in the ovary (follicular fluid IL-6), plus steroid hormone production in 45 women undergoing IVF treatment. RESULTS: Endotoxaemia (LBP) were positively correlated with plasma CRP and inflammation within the ovary (follicular fluid IL-6). Furthermore, endotoxaemia was negatively correlated with progesterone production. CONCLUSION: The observed correlations, together with previously published animal studies linking endotoxin exposure to impaired luteal function, suggest that the translocation of bacterial endotoxin from the gut lumen into the circulation has the potential to interfere with progesterone production and result in luteal deficiency."
31867835,Sickle cell disease in Germany: Results from a national registry.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Limited data on the prevalence and medical care of sickle cell disease (SCD) in Germany are available. Here, we make use of a patient registry to characterize the burden of disease and the treatment modalities for patients with SCD in Germany. PROCEDURE: A nationwide German registry for patients with SCD documents basic data on diagnosis and patient history retrospectively at the time of registration. A prospective annual documentation provides more details on complications and treatment of SCD. For the current analyses, data of 439 patients were available. RESULTS: Most patients had homozygous SCD (HbSS 75.1%, HbS/beta-thalassemia 13.2%, and HbSC 11.3%). The median age at diagnosis was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.6-4.4 years), most patients were diagnosed when characteristic symptoms occurred. Sepsis and stroke had affected 3.2% and 4.2% of patients, respectively. During the first year of observation, 48.3% of patients were admitted to a hospital and 10.1% required intensive care. Prophylactic penicillin was prescribed to 95.6% of patients with homozygous SCD or HbS/beta thalassemia below the age of six and hydroxycarbamide to 90.4% of patients above the age of two years. At least one annual transcranial Doppler ultrasound was documented for 74.8% of patients between 2 and 18 years. CONCLUSION: With an estimated number of at least 2000, the prevalence of SCD in Germany remains low. Prospectively, we expect that the quality of care for children with SCD will be further improved by an earlier diagnosis after the anticipated introduction of a newborn screening program for SCD."
31821975,"Diagnosis, management, and outcome of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA syndrome): Is there a correlation between MRI findings and outcome?",2020,"AIM: To review the experience of a single tertiary center with obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA syndrome) and evaluate if MRI findings correlate with outcome. METHODS: Patients (n = 32) diagnosed with OHVIRA syndrome between 2001 and 2019 were analyzed. Presenting symptoms, age of menarche, age at operation, MRI findings, management, and outcome were reviewed. In sagittal MRI planes, distance from hematocolpos to perineum was measured. Measurements were compared among patients who underwent single-stage vaginoplasty and hemihysterectomy. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis and mean age of menarche was 16.8 +/- 6.4 (10-33) and 12.8 +/- 1.0 (10-15). Main presenting complaints were abdominal pain/dysmenorrhea. Eighteen anomalies (56.3%) were on right side. Twenty-eight had ipsilateral renal agenesis, 3 patients had normal renal anatomy and one had unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney. In MRI, 21 patients had hematocolpos, 11 patients had both hematocolpos and hematometra. 28 patients underwent single-stage vaginoplasty and vaginal septum resection. One had hemihysterectomy due to sepsis at presentation. Three patients had hemihysterectomy due to proximal vaginal septum and impossibility of vaginoplasty. During follow-up, 7 cases (21.9%) had married and 5 of these (71.4%) were pregnant or had delivered. Five patients had reoperation during follow-up. MRI images of 19 patients indicated mean distances from hematocolpos to perineum whom underwent vaginoplasty or hemihysterectomy were 33.9 +/- 18.1 mm (10-79 mm) and 87.3 +/- 11.0 mm (80-100), respectively (p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Gold standard treatment of OHVIRA syndrome is single-stage vaginoplasty. Distance from hematocolpos to perineum in MRI may correlate with surgical outcome. Hemihysterectomy may be an alternative for extreme proximal vaginal septum or infectious complications."
41405037,Risk for sepsis during mechanical circulatory support bigstar.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) risk the development of sepsis. Examining risk factors for the development of sepsis and their relationships to MCS may allow for an improved understanding of these complications. METHODS: Following IRB approval, patient characteristics, previously reported comorbidities, and the incidence of sepsis were studied in 199 patients who received 244 MCS therapies from January 2017 to October 2023. The clinical variables underwent ensemble machine learning modeling. Significant comorbidities predicting sepsis from the ensemble machine modeling underwent decision-tree analysis. RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of sepsis was 20% (95% CI: 16-26%). Following machine learning modeling, patients with a history of congestive heart failure or a history of previous cardiac surgery were associated with an increased risk for developing sepsis. The c-index statistic for this model was 0.76, with a misclassification rate of 19%. Decision-tree analysis observed that patients without chronic cardiovascular disease but with a history of prior cardiac surgery have a 60.3% (95% CI: 60.1-65.2%) incidence of sepsis during MCS therapy. Patients with a history of chronic cardiovascular disease and with a history of congestive heart failure have an 18.1% (95% CI: 17.2-18.7%) incidence of developing sepsis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of sepsis is high in this patient population. The novel associations of patients who have histories of congestive heart failure or previous cardiac surgery requiring MCS suggest an increased systemic inflammatory state exists that escalates the risk for developing sepsis. Further investigation into these background inflammatory conditions in patients requiring MCS is warranted."
26336089,Epidemiologic Associations Between Short-Bowel Syndrome and Bloodstream Infection Among Hospitalized Children.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) suffer from strikingly high rates of morbidity and mortality, due in part to their susceptibility to life-threatening infectious diseases. Few large, multisite studies have evaluated patient-specific factors associated with bacteremia in hospitalized children with and without SBS. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to examine the epidemiological associations between SBS and bloodstream infections (BSI) in hospitalized children. Pediatric BSI cases and controls were selected from a prospective cohort study conducted at 3 New York City hospitals. RESULTS: Among 40 723 hospital admissions of 30 179 children, 1047 diagnoses of BSI were identified. A total of 64 children had a diagnosis of SBS. BSI was identified frequently among hospitalizations for children admitted with SBS (n = 207/450, 46%) compared to hospitalizations for children without the condition (n = 840/40 273, 2.1%, P < .001). While this population represented only 0.2% of our overall cohort, it accounted for nearly 20% of all hospital admissions with BSI. Multivariable analysis identified 8 factors significantly associated with pediatric hospitalizations with BSI. These included a diagnosis of SBS (odds ratio [OR] 19.0), ages 1-5 years (OR 1.33), presence of a non-Broviac-Hickman central venous catheter (OR 6.36), immunosuppression (OR 0.53), kidney injury (OR 6.67), organ transplantation (OR 4.44), admission from a skilled nursing facility (OR 2.66), and cirrhosis (OR 7.23). CONCLUSIONS: While several clinical characteristics are contributory to the risk of BSI in children, SBS remains the single strongest predictor. Further research into the mediators of this risk will be essential for the development of prevention strategies for this vulnerable population."
20120982,"[Initial management of sepsis in the emergency room: ""Time is life""].",2009,"Sepsis is a fairly common disease process in our population. Even with aggressive treatment, morbidity and mortality remain high. The initial evaluation of these patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock may increase survival. Understanding the pathophysiological process is an integral part of improving outcomes. Recent studies have shown that with the systematic use of aggressive fluid expansion, broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as inotropes and vasopressors a decrease in mortality may be achieved. Our efforts must be geared towards a structured early diagnosis and treatment. With the right tools and approach we will be able to keep ourselves ahead of this condition in order to improve the health of our fellow patients in Puerto Rico and the rest of the world."
32995248,National Trends of Organ Dysfunctions in Sepsis:An 11-Year Longitudinal Population-Based Cohort Study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the trend of incidence and mortality of specific organ dysfunction among sepsis patients at the population level. This study aimed to examine the trend and mortality of organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis using a nationwide database in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a study using 2002-2012 data from the nationwide health insurance database of Taiwan. Sepsis hospitalizations were identified by Angus algorithm to include all cases with ICD-9-CM codes for specific sepsis diagnosis and both an infectious process and a diagnosis of acute organ dysfunction. The primary outcome was the trend of incidence and in-hospital mortality of specific type of organ dysfunction in sepsis patients. RESULTS: We identified 1,259,578 adult patients with sepsis. Acute respiratory dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction/shock, and renal system dysfunction were the leading three types of acute organ dysfunction, accounting for 65.6, 30.5, and 18.3% of all sepsis patients, respectively. All types of organ dysfunction increased over time, except for hepatic and metabolic systems. Renal system (annual increase: 13.5%) and cardiovascular system dysfunction (annual increase: 4.3%) had the fastest increase. Mortality from all sources of infection has decreased significantly in the study period (trend p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first true nationwide population-based data showing the trend and outcome of acute organ dysfunction in sepsis patients. Renal and cardiovascular systems dysfunction are increasing at an alarming rate."
18470714,Discriminative power of inflammatory markers for prediction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in ICU patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis at arbitrary time points.,2000,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlations and predictive strength of surrogate markers (body temperature, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT)) with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in septic patients on randomly chosen days. DESIGN: Prospective consecutive case series. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty-three patients experiencing ICU stays of longer than 48 h categorized for sepsis according to ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CRP and PCT were both significantly correlated with TNF-alpha and IL-6. Based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, predictive capability was highest for PCT (0.846 for TNF-alpha>40 pg/ml and 0.837 for IL-6>500 pg/ml), moderate with CRP (0.744 and 0.748, respectively), and lowest for leukocyte count (0.562 and 0.534, respectively) and body temperature (0.570 and 0.623, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and test effectiveness all followed this same pattern of being highest for PCT followed by CRP, with leukocyte count and body temperature being lowest. CONCLUSION: PCT may be an early and better marker of elevated cytokines than the more classic criteria of inflammation."
31818498,Prevalence of HCV infection in a health area of Madrid (Spain): The first step towards microelimination.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of HCV infection in the general population of a health area through an intervention in Primary Care, differentiating between new diagnoses and infections previously diagnosed but not treated. METHODS: Participants were selected through a risk assessment questionnaire, with all those who gave at least one affirmative answer and all those over 50 years of age undergoing a rapid test. Positive tests were confirmed in the lab by determination of anti-HCV antibodies by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and determination of viraemia. RESULTS: Of the 7,991 participants, 36.2% presented a positive HCV risk questionnaire. 4,717 tests were performed, finding an anti-HCV percentage of 0.65% in the screened population, with 0.46% of active infections. Among the individuals with a positive test result, 51.9% had a known prior diagnosis but had not received treatment, because they were not aware of it or were not linked to the health system, and 19.2% had a positive result for the first time. The prevalence of hidden infection was higher in men, those over 50 years of age and people from Eastern Europe. CONCLUSION: We found a prevalence of active infections higher than recently described nationwide, and a higher percentage of newly diagnosed infections than recent similar studies in other areas. These differences justify the need to perform local assessments of the prevalence of HCV infection in each of the health areas where it is planned to implement and monitor a microelimination programme."
25516234,Identification of risk categories for in pancreaticoduodenectomy based on diagnosis.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Studies of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) frequently overlook diagnosis as a variable when evaluating postoperative outcomes or generically group patients according to whether they have 'benign' or 'malignant' disease. Large multicentre studies comparing postoperative outcomes in PD stratified by diagnosis are lacking. The present study was conducted to verify the hypothesis that postoperative morbidity and length of stay (LoS) following PD vary by diagnosis and that patients may be grouped into low- and high-risk categories. METHODS: The database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) was reviewed for all PDs performed during 2005-2011. Diagnoses were identified using ICD-9 codes and grouped based on the incidence of major morbidity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to assess the impact of diagnosis on PD outcomes. RESULTS: Of 5537 patients, those with pancreas cancer (n = 3173) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 485) experienced similar incidences of major morbidity (P = 0.95) and were grouped as having low-risk diagnoses. Patients with bile duct and ampullary (n = 1181), duodenal (n = 558) and neuroendocrine (n = 140) disease experienced similar levels of major morbidity (P = 0.78) and were grouped as having high-risk diagnoses. A high-risk diagnosis was identified as an independent risk factor for a prolonged LoS [odds ratio (OR) 1.67], organ space infection (OR 2.57), sepsis or septic shock (OR 1.83), and major morbidity (OR 1.70). Diagnosis did not predict readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The high-risk diagnosis is independently associated with postoperative morbidity and prolonged LoS. Patients with PD should be stratified by diagnosis to more accurately reflect their risk for postoperative complications and the complexity of care they will require."
25550870,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma manifesting as cholecystitis: report of an Asian variant showing gain of chromosome 18 with concurrent deletion of chromosome 6q.,2014,"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL), which involves the lumen of small vessels, is a rare variant of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Herein, we present a case of IVLBCL manifesting as cholecystitis in a 77-year-old Japanese man. He presented with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Physical examination revealed tenderness of the right upper quadrant. The white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were elevated. Computed tomography revealed gallbladder thickening and pericholecystic fluid collection; these observations were consistent with the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were highly elevated, and gallium scintigraphy revealed an abnormal accumulation in the spleen, implying lymphoma. Consequently, G-banding analysis of the patient's bone marrow aspirates revealed the presence of different abnormal clones, including those with gain of chromosome 18 and deletion of chromosome 6q. As cholecystectomy was necessary, a concurrent splenectomy was performed to diagnose the disease definitively. Histopathologically, atypical large lymphoid cells were observed to be localized in the vasculature in both the spleen and gallbladder; the atypical cells expressed high levels of CD20, CD5, and CD10, immunohistochemically. These findings were consistent with IVLBCL. The patient underwent post-operative treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone. However, a pancreatic fistula developed during chemotherapy, causing left pleural effusion and peritoneal effusion; the patient developed sepsis from multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and subsequently died of multi-organ failure 6 months after the diagnosis. No obvious recurrence of the tumor was found during autopsy. We discuss the characteristic karyotype and immunohistochemical status observed in this case."
41430080,Neutrophil-mediated delivery of hybrid cross-species nanovesicles for treatment of bacterial infections.,2025,"Hybrid vesicles are increasingly employed as nanocarrier systems for drug delivery owing to their versatile functionalities. This study presents a multifunctional vesicle delivery platform, designated PMB@LNV-SyBV, which integrates anti-inflammatory lemon-derived exosomes and attenuated bacterial vesicles to deliver polymyxin B (PMB). The incorporation of exogenous cholesterol enhances the drug-loading capacity of these vesicles. Antimicrobial assays confirm that PMB@LNV-SyBV effectively targets carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. By inheriting pathogen-associated molecular patterns from native bacteria, PMB@LNV-SyBV is efficiently recognized and internalized by neutrophils, enabling it to reach infection sites alongside neutrophil recruitment. Subsequently, the vesicles are released from neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli. In infection models involving Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced mouse pneumonia and K. pneumoniae/Escherichia coli-induced mouse bloodstream infections, PMB@LNV-SyBV significantly reduces bacterial load, modulates pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and increases sepsis survival rates. With its high yield and favorable biocompatibility, the multifunctional PMB@LNV-SyBV represents a promising therapeutic platform for the clinical management of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections."
31851721,Determinants of Group B streptococcal virulence potential amongst vaginal clinical isolates from pregnant women.,2019,"Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram-positive bacterium isolated from the vaginal tract of approximately 25% of women. GBS colonization of the female reproductive tract is of particular concern during pregnancy as the bacteria can invade gestational tissues or be transmitted to the newborn during passage through the birth canal. Infection of the neonate can result in life-threatening pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Thus, surveillance of GBS strains and corresponding virulence potential during colonization is warranted. Here we describe a panel of GBS isolates from the vaginal tracts of a cohort of pregnant women in Michigan, USA. We determined that capsular serotypes III and V were the most abundant across the strain panel, with only one isolate belonging to serotype IV. Further, 12.8% of strains belonged to the hyper-virulent serotype III, sequence type 17 (ST-17) and 15.4% expressed the serine rich repeat glycoprotein-encoding gene srr2. Functional assessment of the colonizing isolates revealed that almost all strains exhibited some level of beta-hemolytic activity and that ST-17 strains, which express Srr2, exhibited increased bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelium. Finally, analysis of strain antibiotic susceptibility revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance to penicillin (15.4%), clindamycin (30.8%), erythromycin (43.6%), vancomycin (30.8%), and tetracycline (94.9%), which has significant implications for treatment options. Collectively, these data provide important information on vaginal GBS carriage isolate virulence potential and highlight the value of continued surveillance."
31824670,Evidence-based Clinical Decision Support Systems for the prediction and detection of three disease states in critical care: A systematic literature review.,2019,"Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have emerged as tools providing intelligent decision making to address challenges of critical care. CDS systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems."
31857208,Comparative efficacy and safety of lock solutions for the prevention of catheter-related complications including infectious and bleeding events in adult haemodialysis patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters are used extensively as temporary or permanent vascular access for haemodialysis patients. Catheter-related bloodstream infections are the main complication of central venous catheters and increase morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the most appropriate lock solution for central venous catheters to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections and other complications. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of their inception to August 2018 were used as data sources. The reference lists of eligible studies and relevant reviews were also checked. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different lock solutions for the prevention of central venous catheter-related infectious and bleeding complications for adult dialysis patients were included. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions were lock solutions for haemodialysis catheters. METHODS: The primary outcomes were catheter-related bloodstream infections and bleeding events. The secondary outcomes were catheter malfunction, exit-site infection, and all-cause mortality. We estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Forty-nine trials (7020 patients) were included for this study. Compared with heparin 5000 U/mL, antibiotic locks (antibiotics with trisodium citrate (TSC), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), heparin 5000 U/mL, low-dose heparin or urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/mL), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/mL. None of the lock solutions reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared with heparin 5000 U/mL. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin was ranked as the best lock solution. The overall results were not materially changed in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account both efficacy and safety, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/mL) may be the preferred lock solution."
31839037,[Clinical and Bacteriological Analysis of Bacterial Bloodstream Infections in Patients with Acute Leukemial].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, etiology and drug susceptibility of bacterial bloodstream infections in acute leukemia(AL) patients. METHODS: Clinical data, etiology and drug susceptibility of acute leukemia patients with bacterial bloodstream infections from April 2009 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 376 strains were isolated, 76.9% was Gram-negative bacterial and 23.1% was Gram-positive bacteria. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were listed as the top three of Gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to the tigacycline, imipenem and meropenem was 100.0%, 98.2% and 98.1%, respectively. The susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to the tigacycline, imipenem and meropenem were 100.0%, 98.3% and 94.4%, respectively. The adjustment rate for initial use of carbopenems was 3.8%, while the adjustment rate for initial use of noncarbopenems was 74.3% in patients with main Gram-negative bacterial blood stream infection. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to glycopeptide antibiotics, linezolid and tigacycline was 100.0%. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria is the majority type of bacteria in AL patients with bacteria blood stream infections. The susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to the carbapenems is high, and the treatment adjustment rate is obviously low. The glycopeptide, linezolid and tigacycline are effective for Gram-positive bacteria infections.."
34279227,Clinical value of alkaline phosphatase on the surface membrane of neutrophils for prediction of bacteremia in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.,2021,"In this study, the utility and diagnostic accuracy of alkaline phosphatase on the surface membrane of neutrophils (mNAP) for bacteremia in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was investigated and assessed. A total of 149 patients with SIRS were included. mNAP values were significantly higher in bacteremic SIRS group compared with that in non-bacteremic SIRS group (P < 0.001). The mNAP levels were significantly higher in SIRS patients with gram-negative bacteremia than those with gram-positive bacteremia. (P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed the areas under ROC (AUC) of 0.806 for mNAP in differentiating SIRS patients with bacteremia from those without, similar to that for procalcitonin (PCT) (0.797). Combination of PCT and mNAP gave an AUC of 0.841. mNAP shares a similar diagnostic accuracy to PCT in predicting bacteremia in SIRS patients. The combination of mNAP and PCT provides a better prediction of bacteremia in patients with SIRS than either test alone."
25547353,Rapid testing using the Verigene Gram-negative blood culture nucleic acid test in combination with antimicrobial stewardship intervention against Gram-negative bacteremia.,2015,"Rapid identification of microorganisms and antimicrobial resistance is paramount for targeted treatment in serious bloodstream infections (BSI). The Verigene Gram-negative blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GN) is a multiplex, automated molecular diagnostic test for identification of eight Gram-negative (GN) organisms and resistance markers from blood culture with a turnaround time of approximately 2 h. Clinical isolates from adult patients at the University Maryland Medical Center with GN bacteremia from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012 were included in this study. Blood culture bottles were spiked with clinical isolates, allowed to incubate, and processed by BC-GN. A diagnostic evaluation was performed. In addition, a theoretical evaluation of time to effective and optimal antibiotic was performed, comparing actual antibiotic administration times from chart review (""control"") to theoretical administration times based on BC-GN reporting and antimicrobial stewardship team (AST) review (""intervention""). For organisms detected by the assay, BC-GN correctly identified 95.6% (131/137), with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.7 to 98.4%) and a specificity of 99.5% (95% CI, 98.8 to 99.8%). CTX-M and OXA resistance determinants were both detected. Allowing 12 h from Gram stain for antibiotic implementation, the intervention group had a significantly shorter duration to both effective (3.3 versus 7.0 h; P < 0.01) and optimal (23.5 versus 41.8 h; P < 0.01) antibiotic therapy. BC-GN with AST intervention can potentially decrease time to both effective and optimal antibiotic therapy in GN BSI."
19996590,Post-antibiotic effect of levofloxacin and tobramycin alone or in combination with cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Levofloxacin and tobramycin, alone and in combination with cefepime, were investigated for their in vitro activities and post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: The in vitro activities of tobramycin and levofloxacin in combination with cefepime were determined by microbroth chequerboard technique against six P. aeruginosa strains that were isolated from patients with bacteremia. The results were interpreted by fractional inhibitory concentration index. To determine the PAEs, P. aeruginosa strains in the logarithmic phase of growth were exposed for 1 h to antibiotics, alone and in combination. Recovery periods of test cultures were evaluated using viable counting after centrifugation. RESULTS: Three synergistic interactions were observed with cefepime-tobramycin and one with cefepime-levofloxacin combinations against tested strains.No antagonism was observed. Levofloxacin produced a PAE ranging from 1.9 to 4.5 h in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar PAEs were induced by tobramycin (ranging from 1.5 to 3.1 h). However, negative PAE values were obtained with cefepime. In combination, cefepime slightly reduced the PAE of tobramycin and levofloxacin against studied strains. CONCLUSION: The finding of this study may have important clinical implications for the timing of doses during therapy with cefepime, levofloxacin and tobramycin alone and in combination."
41558044,Concordance of CO2 gaps measured using peripheral and central venous blood in patients diagnosed with septic shock.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the venous-arterial CO2 difference (Pv-aCO2) from peripheral venous blood (Pv-aCO2p) as a less invasive alternative to central venous Pv-aCO2 for assessing tissue perfusion in septic shock. METHODS: A prospective, single-center study included 54 septic shock patients with central venous catheters placed within 24 h of intensive care unit admission. Blood samples from arterial, central venous, and peripheral venous sources were analyzed. Correlation analyses and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between Pv-aCO2p and central Pv-aCO2. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 70 years, and 51.9% were male. The median SOFA score was 8.5, and the mean APACHE-II score was 22.7. The Pv-aCO2p gap was 8 mmHg, whereas the central Pv-aCO2 gap was 6 mmHg. A moderate correlation was found between Pv-aCO2p and central Pv-aCO2 (r = 0.593, p < 0.001), with stronger correlations observed in patients with arterial lactate >/=2 mmol/L (r = 0.673) and hemoglobin <8 g/dL (r = 0.625). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean difference of 8.278 mmHg between arterial and peripheral pCO2. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral Pv-aCO2p correlates well with central Pv-aCO2 and can serve as a less invasive alternative for assessing tissue perfusion in septic shock patients. It offers practical utility when central venous access is not available, aiding in early clinical decisions."
25672140,[A case of Lemierre's syndrome with septic pulmonary embolisms].,2014,"A 41-year-old-man with sore throat and fever visited a nearby clinic. He was given antibiotics, but on disease day 11, the left side of his neck had swollen. Because chest CT on disease day 16 showed bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules, he was admitted to our hospital. He had septic pulmonary embolisms and thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein, and Fusobacterium necrophorum was isolated from the blood and neck pus culture, and we diagnosed him as having Lemierre's syndrome. We administered piperacillin/ tazobactam and heparin, and his symptoms improved thereafter. Lemierre's syndrome is relatively rare but is increasing in recent years. We report herein this case and compare reported cases in Japan with those from overseas."
15665955,"Effect of NO synthase inhibitor 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-thiazine on endotoxin-induced changes in hemodynamic parameters and respiration in rats.",2004,"We studied the effect of NO synthase inhibitor 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-thiazine (2-ADT) on the cardiovascular system in rats with endotoxic shock. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. E. coli lipopolysaccharide decreased blood pressure and heart rate. 2-ADT in a dose of 5 mg/kg normalized these hemodynamic parameters. The normalizing effect of 2-ADT decreased with increasing the dose of this preparation. 2-ADT in high doses (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) and repeated injections of the preparation caused death of experimental animals."
15597797,[Analysis of heart rate variability is a useful tool to predict the occurrence of septic shock in the patients with severe sepsis].,2004,"The normal heart rate is regulated by a number of interacting physiological control systems that operate on widely different time scales. Thus, instantaneous heart rate is not steady, but rather demonstrates continuous fluctuations. It has been recognized that power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive method to assess cardiac autonomic modulation. We hypothesized that the loss of interconnectivity or coupling between heart and other organs results in the occurrence of septic shock in patients with severe sepsis. We found that the reduction of HRV precedes the occurrence of septic shock. Therefore, we conclude that analysis of HRV is a novel and useful tool to predict the occurrence of septic shock among the patients with severe sepsis."
19949761,Tubo-ovarian abscess with Morganella morganii bacteremia.,2009,"Tubo-ovarian abscess caused by Morganella morganii is unusual. A 54-year-old menopausal woman visited the emergency room with lower abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever for 4 days. Pelvic examination revealed lifting tenderness over the right adnexum without motion tenderness of the uterus. Pelvic sonogram revealed a cystic lesion with heterogeneous content in the right ovary. Salpingo-oophoritis was suspected. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered intravenously after obtaining blood cultures. Laparoscopy was done because of sustained fever, and an ovarian abscess was found. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The patient was discharged 5 days later and oral clindamycin was prescribed. However, she was readmitted due to intermittent fever. The result of blood culture obtained before surgery disclosed M. morganii, which was resistant to clindamycin and cefazolin. Her symptoms resolved after administration of intravenous flomoxef. This report highlights the fact that antimicrobial resistance of M. morganii may complicate the management and outcome of this infection."
41668728,Omega-3 fatty acids as host-directed immunomodulatory therapeutics in sepsis: real-world evidence supporting drug development potential for systemic inflammatory diseases.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality worldwide, characterized by dysregulated inflammation and immune dysfunction mechanisms also central to many neglected tropical diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-3 FAs) possess potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that may improve survival outcomes in such conditions. This retrospective real-world study evaluated the impact of Omega-3 FA supplementation on ICU mortality among patients with sepsis and identified prognostic factors influencing therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Patients admitted with sepsis to the ICU of Shenzhen People's Hospital between December 2016 and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied at a 1:2 ratio between Omega-3 FA-treated and control groups using covariates including age, sex, diagnosis, norepinephrine (NE) requirement, hemofiltration (HF), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte count. Logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to determine the independent effect of Omega-3 FAs on mortality. RESULTS: A total of 633 patients were included (Omega-3 FA group, n = 211; control, n = 422). The unadjusted mortality rate was 32.7% in the Omega-3 FA group and 24.6% in controls (p = 0.032). Univariate analysis showed a weak protective effect of Omega-3 FAs (HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-1.02, p = 0.062). After adjusting for age, HF and NE requirements, CRP, lymphocyte count, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and abdominal infection, Omega-3 FAs demonstrated a significant protective effect (HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83, p = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed improved survival in the Omega-3 FA group (p = 0.038). Advanced age, elevated CRP, and higher NE dependence were identified as factors that negatively modulated Omega-3 FA efficacy. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with significantly reduced adjusted ICU mortality in sepsis, underscoring its host-directed immunomodulatory properties. These findings highlight the translational potential of Omega-3 FAs as adjunct therapeutic agents in sepsis and other infection-associated inflammatory disorders, supporting further drug development toward host-directed treatments for neglected tropical diseases."
41401657,Metformin diminishes lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy: Molecular insights on vascular endothelial growth factor-A and its receptors.,2026,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a hypoxia- and cytokine-inducible biomarker of endothelial activation, together with its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, contributes to endotoxemia and early sepsis-related vascular dysfunction by increasing permeability and tissue edema. The current research explored the dose-dependent therapeutic effects of metformin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia with cardiopulmonary dysfunction and microvascular coagulopathy in male Wistar rats. Endotoxemia was induced by a single intraperitoneal LPS injection, and metformin was administered at 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg. Metformin dose-dependently improved survival and attenuated LPS-induced tachycardia, QTc prolongation, ST-segment elevation, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and elevations in serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced VEGF-A, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 expression in cardiopulmonary tissues, with the 400 mg/kg dose nearly restoring normal levels. KEGG and Reactome analyses revealed that VEGFR2 activation drives PI3K-Akt-eNOS, p38/HSP27, and MAPK/ERK pathways promoting endothelial permeability, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Molecular docking further confirmed potential interactions between metformin and key VEGF signaling proteins-VEGFR2, MAPK1, PDK1, and Src kinase-through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, supporting the predicted inhibitory mechanism. STRING protein-protein interaction analysis identified VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4) as central hubs linking angiogenic and adaptor proteins. Collectively, these experimental and computational findings indicate that metformin ameliorates LPS-induced endotoxemia and cardiopulmonary microvascular coagulopathy via modulation of VEGF-A/VEGFR1/VEGFR2 signaling, providing mechanistic and translational insight into its potential endothelial-protective effects especially in comorbid patients on metformin maintenance therapy."
41510275,Metagenomic Cell-free DNA Sequencing for Treatment Monitoring in Sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. Early identification of pathogens and accurate assessment of organ injury are critical for improving outcomes, but current methods are often inadequate, especially after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Metagenomic sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) offers a promising alternative, enabling simultaneous pathogen detection and tissue-of-origin profiling. Contamination, however, can limit its accuracy in low-biomass samples. Here, we apply the Sample-Intrinsic Microbial DNA Found by Tagging and Sequencing (SIFT-seq) assay, which reduces contamination and allows detection of pathogens and organ injury simultaneously. We analyzed 142 plasma specimens: 105 from sepsis patients, 103 collected after initiation of antibiotic treatment, 24 from non-sepsis ICU controls, and 13 from healthy controls. SIFT-seq identified sepsis-causing pathogens in good agreement with pre-antibiotic blood cultures, revealed elevated immune activity and organ injury in sepsis patients, and, when combined with the SOFA score in a multivariate model, improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.874). These findings highlight the potential of integrated cfDNA profiling to enhance sepsis diagnosis."

On arrival, he was found to have a haemoglobin of 57 g/L and platelet count of 82x10(9)/L. Further work-up revealed six of eight diagnostic criteria for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): fever >38.9 degrees C, splenomegaly, cytopaenia, hypertriglyceridaemia, haemophagocytosis and elevated ferritin >31 000 ng/mL. He was also found to have Epstein-Barr viraemia with greater than 17 000 copies. Bone marrow biopsy showed the presence of haemophagocytic histiocytes and evidence of classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was started on HLH-94 protocol. Later treatment was switched to lymphoma-directed therapy and he finished six cycles of A+AVD (brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) with end-of-treatment positron emission tomography/CT and bone marrow negative for lymphoma."

31839719,Integrated diagnostics: the future of laboratory medicine?,2020,"The current scenario of in vitro and in vivo diagnostics can be summarized using the ""silo metaphor"", where laboratory medicine, pathology and radiology are three conceptually separated diagnostic disciplines, which will increasingly share many comparable features. The substantial progresses in our understanding of biochemical-biological interplays that characterize many human diseases, coupled with extraordinary technical advances, are now generating important multidisciplinary convergences, leading the way to a new frontier, called integrated diagnostics. This new discipline, which is currently defined as convergence of imaging, pathology and laboratory tests with advanced information technology, has an enormous potential for revolutionizing diagnosis and therapeutic management of human diseases, including those causing the largest number of worldwide deaths (i.e. cardiovascular disease, cancer and infectious diseases). However, some important drawbacks should be overcome, mostly represented by insufficient information technology infrastructures, costs and enormous volume of different information that will be integrated and delivered. To overcome these hurdles, some specific strategies should be defined and implemented, such as planning major integration of exiting information systems or developing innovative ones, combining bioinformatics and imaging informatics, using health technology assessment for assessing cost and benefits, providing interpretative comments in integrated reports, developing and using expert systems and neural networks, overcoming cultural and political boundaries for generating multidisciplinary teams and integrated diagnostic algorithms."
41547600,Analysis and comparison of the difference between two major blood culture system in the laboratory and neonatal intensive care unit.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a critical health concern that demands accurate and timely diagnosis. Blood culture, the gold standard, is challenging in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants because of the limited blood volume and potential aerobic culture limitations. The VersaTREK (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) blood culture system, which requires less blood and offers both aerobic and anaerobic cultures, presents a potential solution. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance with the widely used BD (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) blood culture systems for neonatal sepsis patients. METHODS: We conducted a three-step study, including in vitro testing of common pathogens, prospective observational cohort data from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and a head-to-head comparison. VersaTREK's blood culture bottles include aerobic and anaerobic media, whereas BD uses a specialized bottle for aerobic cultures. RESULTS: In phase 1 of this in vitro comparison study, VersaTREK outperformed BD, particularly at low bacterial loads. In phase 2, a prospective observational cohort analysis revealed a significantly greater yield with VersaTREK, especially for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria. In phase 3, a head-to-head comparison demonstrated comparable performance between the two systems, with potential advantages for VersaTREK in scenarios involving minimal blood volumes, as little as 0.1 mL. CONCLUSIONS: The VersaTREK and BD blood culture systems demonstrated similar diagnostic performance, with VersaTREK capable of detecting as little as 0.1 mL of blood. While this is promising in scenarios with minimal blood volume, further investigations with larger sample sizes are needed."
20146868,Procalcitonin levels as an early marker in patients with multiple trauma under intensive care.,2009,"This prospective study investigated the levels of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with various types and severity of multiple trauma, and their relationship to trauma-related complications. Adult multiple-trauma patients (n = 113) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the first 24 h after trauma were included. The Injury Severity Scores (ISS), and PCT and CRP levels were measured in the first 24 h (day 1), on day 7 and on the final day of their ICU stay. Survival at 30 days was recorded. Mean PCT and CRP levels were both significantly higher on day 7 compared with day 1 and the final assessment day in patients with an ISS > 20. Levels of PCT were significantly higher in cases with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock compared with cases who developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), however levels of CRP were significantly higher only in cases with severe sepsis or septic shock, but not in cases with sepsis alone. These data support the view that PCT levels may be a better indicator than CRP levels in the early diagnosis of septic complications in patients with multiple trauma."
41607500,Influence of anesthetic agent and burst suppression on postoperative delirium in elderly patients: a prospective cohort study with automated EEG analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines currently suggest considering EEG guidance during general anesthesia in elderly patients to avoid prolonged burst suppression (BS), with the aim of mitigating postoperative delirium (POD). Our study aimed to investigate the association between POD and intraoperative BS duration dependent on the general anesthetic agent used (propofol vs. sevoflurane). METHODS: In this prospective study (2019-2022), EEGs from 265 patients over 70 years undergoing general anesthesia were analyzed for intraoperative BS duration both visually and using one new automated algorithm to evaluate its accuracy. Associations between BS duration, anesthetic agent, and postoperative delirium (POD) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: BS duration was markedly shorter than in prior cohorts but did not reduce overall postoperative delirium (POD) incidence. POD occurred more frequently with sevoflurane than propofol (44% vs. 30%, p = 0.017), despite shorter median BS [0 s (IQR 0-4.9) vs. 20.6 s (IQR 0-151.7); p = 0.012]. A significant interaction between anesthetic agent and BS (p = 0.033) showed that BS under sevoflurane conferred 3.8-fold greater POD risk than under propofol. Sevoflurane plus BS increased POD odds 9.3-fold compared to propofol without BS. Our new automated BS detection algorithm demonstrated high precision (median error <2.17 s). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane markedly increased POD risk versus propofol, independent of BS duration. Sevoflurane and BS interaction amplified delirium odds. BS appears a vulnerability marker rather than a causal factor. The validated machine-learning BS detector offers a reliable tool for future EEG-based delirium risk research."
41640555,"Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility from blood culture specimens in Wad Medani, Sudan: a four-year laboratory-based, cross-sectional study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-resistant bacterial bloodstream infections are rapidly emerging, which makes successful treatment challenging. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility from blood culture samples. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. All clinical samples were collected from patients at Wad Medani and investigated at the Pathology Center for Diagnosis and Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Gazira, Sudan, from the 1st of January, 2020, to the 15th of October, 2023. RESULTS: Overall, 577 blood samples were cultured. Among these samples, 86 (14.9%) exhibited bacterial growth. S. aureus (40.7%) and E. coli (40.7%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria. The most sensitive drugs to S. aureus were vancomycin 100% (13/13) and linezolid 86.7% (13/15), whereas the most sensitive drugs to E. coli were norfloxacin 88.9% (8/9), imipenem 85.7% (6/7), and levofloxacin 84% (21/25). The rate of bacterial growth has steadily increased over time, from 5% in 2020 to 24.9% in 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a modest rate of 14.9% of bloodstream infections, which has steadily increased over the years. The most frequently isolated bacteria were S. aureus and E. coli. Vancomycin was the most susceptible drug to isolated bacteria."
31828251,Septic Pulmonary Embolism Associated with Klebsiella spp. Infection in a Patient with Previous ASD Operation.,2019,"Septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is an uncommon disease caused by thromboembolism associated with microorganisms. A 57-year old woman patient who was monitored for a prediagnosis of subileus suffered from sudden respiration problems in the hospital ward. The patient's history included atrial fibrillation and atrioseptal defect (ASD) operation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in order to apply non-invasive mechanical ventilation and keep her under observation because of low saturation and loss of consciousness. In the ICU, the patient's temperature was 38.8 degrees C, which led to the diagnosis of sepsis. The chest X-ray showed bilateral and multiple patchy infiltrates. The thorax CT showed right lower pulmonary consolidation and left pulmonary pleuroparenchymal density with nodular shapes. The electrocardiogram showed mild pulmonary hypertension and third-degree tricuspid failure. These features indicated SPE because of the ASD operation in the past. The blood culture showed the presence of Klebsiella spp., which is uncommon. A characteristic CT sign is very important for the early diagnosis and treatment of SPE."
25536735,Thromboelastography in the evaluation of coagulation disorders in patients with sepsis.,2014,"AIM: Unbalanced hemostasis and disseminated intravenous coagulopathy serve as key participants in organ dysfunction and disability. In this study we evaluated the coagulation profiles of patients diagnosed with systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIRS)-sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. We also researched coagulation in sepsis by comparing thromboelastography (TEG) data with those of nonsepsis patients to determine the usefulness of the TEG device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 55 anesthesiology and surgery intensive care unit (ICU) patients: 21 with SIRS-sepsis (Group S) and 34 patients without SIRS-sepsis (Group C). Blood samples were taken upon admission to the ICU (t1) and on day 3 of the ICU stay (t2). TEG data (R = reaction time, K = coagulation time, a = alpha angle, and MA = maximum amplitude) were recorded. TEG parameters were compared with routine coagulation and hemogram studies. RESULTS: The mean R value in Group C was higher than that of Group S at both t1 and t2. Group S had a significantly lower K value and higher alpha angle at t1 compared to Group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypercoagulability was observed in SIRS-sepsis patients in the ICU, as measured with TEG. We believe that TEG will be a useful tool in the evaluation of coagulation disorders developing in septic critically ill patients."
41494172,Peripheral Vasopressor Administration in Adults With Sepsis: A Retrospective Study of Guideline Adherence and Complications.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) vasopressor administration is increasingly used to expedite the treatment of septic shock when central venous access is not immediately available. This shift in practice reflects growing support from national guidelines, which permit short-term peripheral administration of vasopressors in adults. On March 9, 2023, hospitals within 1 health care system implemented guidelines for PIVC vasopressor administration in adult critical care settings, specifically emergency departments and intensive care units. OBJECTIVE: This study examined adherence to these guidelines for PIVC vasopressor use and to identify associated complications. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study included 106 adult patients (68 emergency department and 38 intensive care unit patients) diagnosed with sepsis and receiving peripheral vasopressors. RESULTS: The majority of patients received norepinephrine through a short PIVC. Overall, 5 patients (4.7%) experienced complications, 4 with thrombophlebitis and 1 with an extravasation. All 5 patients received norepinephrine at the organization's policy-specified concentration via short PIVCs. However, only 1 of these patients met the system's guidelines for minimum PIVC size, quantity, and maximum infusion duration. Overall, only 58% of patients were managed in full compliance with the system's guidelines. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of standardized protocols to reduce complications associated with short-term peripheral vasopressor administration."
41462702,Hydralazine Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Murine Myocardial Dysfunction by Inhibition of Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is a fatal complication with limited therapeutic options. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) contributes to oxidative stress and leukocyte recruitment, yet its role in SIMD remains unexplored. This study investigates whether hydralazine, a potent SSAO inhibitor, protects against SIMD by evaluating the involvement of SSAO inhibition. Using a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis, hydralazine was administered 30 min post-injection. Over a 7-day observation period, survival rates, cardiac function (assessed by echocardiography), and myocardial injury (evaluated via plasma biomarkers including CK, CK-MB, LDH, and AST, alongside histopathology) were monitored. Additional analyses included measurements of oxidative stress markers (T-AOC, GSH-PX, SOD, MDA, GSH), inflammatory chemokine levels using a Luminex panel, and myocardial SSAO activity via HPLC. The results demonstrated that hydralazine at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly improved 7-day survival rates from 20% to 90% and enhanced cardiac function in septic mice. It also reduced myocardial injury and histological damage while attenuating systemic inflammation through suppression of chemokine elevation. Furthermore, hydralazine boosted systemic and myocardial antioxidant capacity and normalized the sepsis-induced increase in myocardial SSAO activity, suggesting a potential mechanism for its protective effects. In conclusion, hydralazine shows robust cardioprotection in experimental sepsis by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cell infiltration. The inhibition of SSAO activity may be a pivotal underlying molecular mechanism."
41595830,Travel-Associated Melioidosis in Non-Endemic Regions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Background: Travel-associated melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is increasingly reported in non-endemic countries due to rising global travel. Understanding demographic, clinical, and outcome patterns of imported cases is important to improve recognition and management in settings where melioidosis is uncommon. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (last search: 24 September 2025) for case reports and case series of melioidosis diagnosed outside endemic regions and linked to travel exposure. Data were extracted on demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. We performed descriptive analyses, subgroup analyses, and Firth's penalized logistic regression to explore predictors of death. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251154559). Results: A total of 104 studies, encompassing 143 individual cases, were included. Most diagnoses occurred in non-endemic, high-income countries, especially the Netherlands (21%), France (10%), the United States (9%), and South Korea (7%). Infections were predominantly acquired in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand (39%). The mean patient age was 50.6 years, with a male predominance (78%). Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comorbidity (28%). Clinical presentations included pulmonary (33%), sepsis (27%), cutaneous (13%), abdominal (4%), and osteoarticular disease (1%). Overall mortality was 12.6% and relapse occurred in 7%. In penalized regression analyses, no baseline characteristic was statistically significantly associated with mortality; septic presentation showed an elevated point estimate for odds of death, but with imprecise estimates. Conclusions: Travel-associated melioidosis is a rare but clinically significant imported infection. Most cases followed exposure in Southeast Asia, and pulmonary disease and sepsis were the most frequent presentations. Mortality remained substantial (12.6%), and relapse was reported in 7%, underscoring the need for early recognition, appropriate therapy, and follow-up in non-endemic settings."
19943557,Changes in vasopressin use and outcomes in surgical intensive care unit patients with septic shock.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: This study compares recent vasopressin use and outcomes to our early practice when vasopressin was introduced for septic shock. METHODS: Charts of Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) patients receiving vasopressin for septic shock in 2005-2006 (05-06 cohort,) were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, APACHE II, hemodynamic variables, and vasoactive drug data were compared to a similar 1999-2000 cohort (99-00 cohort). Statistical analysis included general linear model, Chi-square, t-test, and Cox-regression (p < 0.05 considered significant). RESULTS: Thirty-one SICU patients in the 05-06 cohort and twenty patients in the 99-00 cohort met study criteria. Age, weight, gender, intensive care length of stay and vasopressin treatment duration were similar in the two groups. APACHE II (23 +/- 7 versus 34 +/- 9), baseline vasopressin dose (2.2 +/- 1.4 units/hour versus 5.3 +/- 6.7 units/hour), and SICU survival rate (45% versus 15%) significantly changed between the two time periods (p < 0.01). The mean arterial pressure increased significantly from baseline at all measured time points in both groups (p < 0.05). Vasopressin and dopamine doses were significantly lower in the 05-06 cohort versus the 99-00 cohort (p < 0.05). By Cox regression analysis the survival function adjusted for APACHE II was significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin is recently used at lower doses and in less severe septic shock. Patients recently treated with vasopressin have a higher SICU survival rate than the survival rate when vasopressin was first introduced for septic shock."
15790073,Role of pencillin binding proteins in pencillin allergy.,2004,"All beta-lactam sensitive bacteria contain enzymatic penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), which are membrane-bound enzymes and targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. In this work evaluation of the significance of PBPs in immune response to benzylpenicillin was presented. 35 patients with allergic reactions to penicillin and 17 subjects without penicillin allergy, but exposed, were studied. Proliferative T-cell responses to benzylpenicillin, penicillin and PBPs conjugates (Pc-PBPs) from E. coli, K. oxytoca, S. aureus, S. epidermidis or serum protein (Pc-S) were measured. Although each allergic individual responds to Pc-PBPs in several different ways, specific proliferation of T lymphocytes with Pc-PBPs from bacterial membranes was significant higher than with Pc or Pc-S. This observation gives us a real insight into the causes of the drug allergy: individual allergic reaction and susceptibility to the drug is in strict correlation with bacterial infection. It seems likely that acylation of PBPs could be the trigger for primary immune response to the hapten benzylpenicillin."
15580474,Steroid-induced myopathy in patients intubated due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2005,"OBJECTIVE: To determine incidence, risk factors and impact on various outcome parameters of the development of acute quadriplegic myopathy in a selected population of critically ill patients. SETTING: A prospective cohort study carried out in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-level university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients admitted due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and received high doses of intravenous corticosteroids. INTERVENTIONS: A neurophysiological study was performed in all cases at the onset of weaning. Muscular biopsy was taken when the neurophysiological study revealed a myopathic pattern. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Nine patients (34.6%) developed myopathy. Only seven patients were treated with muscle relaxants. Histology confirmed the diagnosis in the three patients who underwent muscle biopsy. APACHE II score at admission, the rate of sepsis and the total doses of corticosteroids were significantly higher in patients with myopathy compared with those patients that did not develop it. Myopathy is associated with an increase in the duration of mechanical ventilation [15.4 (9.2) versus 5.7 (3.9) days; p<0.006], the length of ICU stay [23.6 (10.7) versus 11.4 (7.05) days; p<0.003] and hospital stay [33.3 (19.2) versus 21.2 (16.1) days; p<0.034)]. Myopathy was not associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the population under study, severity of illness at admission, the development of sepsis and the total dose of corticosteroids are factors associated with the occurrence of myopathy after the administration of corticosteroids. Myopathy was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and in-hospital stay."
25679930,"[Epidemiology of febrile neutropenia in adult patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma: Cohort study of public and private hospital of Santiago, Chile].",2014,"INTRODUCTION: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of patients undergoing chemotherapy (QMT). Clinical presentation is varied, from mild fever to severe sepsis with invasive bacterial infection (IBI) or invasive fungal infection (IFI), with great impact on prognosis and patient mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of FN episodes in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL) or lymphoma (L), diagnosed and treated at the Hospital Clinico Universidad Catolica and Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio in Santiago from April 2010 to January 2012. RESULTS: 130 patients were included with 105 episodes of NF, with an incidence of 0.65 per 100 days of observation, higher in AL than L (1.31 vs 0.25, p = 0.001). Etiology or clinical focus was documented in 67 (63.8%) episodes, with IBI in 33 (31.4%) and IFI in 21 (20%) cases. Mortality related to infection occurred in 4 (6.2%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that the FN incidence and frequency of IBI and IFI during episodes are higher in AL vs. L. It is necessary to evaluate the impact of interventions to reduce its incidence, including the benefit and risk of using antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups."
25533616,Accuracy of different methods for susceptibility testing of gentamicin with KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.,2015,"Performance of Vitek2, Etest, and TREK broth microdilution (BMD) panels was evaluated versus reference CLSI BMD for gentamicin susceptibility testing with 57 bloodstream isolates of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Compared with reference BMD, the Essential Agreement and Categorical Agreement for TREK panels, Vitek2, and Etest were 91.2%, 31.6%, and 61.4%, respectively, and 86%, 21%, and 52.6%, respectively. Four very major discrepancies occurred with Vitek2. In these 4 strains, gentamicin resistance was associated with the presence of an armA aminoglycoside resistance determinant."
16352065,The changing profile of bacterial endocarditis as seen at an australian provincial centre.,2002,"BACKGROUND: The clinical profile of endocarditis has changed over the past four decades with studies showing trends towards increasing age, more nosocomial and prosthetic valve infection and increasing rates of Staphylococcus aureus infection. However, these studies have been biased by referral patterns. METHODS: We reviewed data collected at three hospitals in the Barwon-South-West region in Victoria, Australia. All cases identified between 1994 and 1999 were reviewed according to the Duke criteria. RESULTS: During this period, 58 patients were diagnosed as having endocarditis. The incidence rate during this time was 3.0 per 100 000 with a rise in the rate of admissions from 0.15 to 0.26 per 1000 from 1995 to 1999. Sixteen (28%) were nosocomial with the majority from line-related sepsis. No intravenous drug users were identified. Eighteen (31%) involved endovascular prosthetic material. S. aureus was the causative pathogen in 23 (40%), with 'viridans' streptococci contributing 12 (21%) and other organisms accounting for 12 (21%). Attributable mortality in this series was 17%. CONCLUSIONS: We have seen a rise in the rate of endocarditis during this time. The proportions of endocarditis due to S. aureus and 'viridans' streptococci, as well as rates of nosocomial and prosthetic valve infection, are consistent with more recent series at referral hospitals and district hospitals, representing a change since studies performed in the 1960s and 1970s. Our findings confirm a trend towards a clinical profile seen at referral centres and reinforce the emerging importance of S. aureus, nosocomial bacteraemia and prosthetic valve endocarditis."
20017890,Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors: promising novel biomarkers in severe sepsis?,2009,"The multicenter study conducted by Lorente and coworkers published in the previous issue of Critical Care demonstrates that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-10 and their inhibitor tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) are promising novel biomarkers to predict severity and outcome of sepsis. In recent years MMPs have emerged as biomarkers in a variety of diseases, such as sepsis, coronary artery disease, cancer, heart failure, chronic lung disease and rheumatoid arthritis. MMPs constitute a family of proteinases that are expressed during developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes, for example as a response to infection. Excessive inflammation following infection may cause tissue damage, and MMPs are implicated in causing this immunopathology. The activity of MMPs is regulated by secretion of specific inhibitors (TIMPs). Studies using MMP inhibitors and MMP knockout mice indicate that MMPs play an essential role in infection and in the host response to infection. The measurement of MMP-9 and MMP-10 and their inhibitor TIMP-1 in the intensive care setting could be an attractive noninvasive tool for determination of outcome of septic patients."
31857921,Dapagliflozin-induced Late-onset Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis.,2019,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of oral hypoglycemics that improve glycemic control by increasing the urinary excretion of glucose. They gained widespread popularity because they not only showed improved glycemic control but also had a favorable effect on weight loss, blood pressure, and cardiovascular mortality. One of their rare side effects is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eDKA) although the diagnosis is sometimes difficult to make due to near-normal glucose levels. We present a case of eDKA in a patient who presented with confusion, acute kidney injury (AKI), and metabolic acidosis after having an influenza-like illness with a minimally elevated blood glucose of 187 mg/dL. She had already stopped taking dapagliflozin (an SGLT-2 inhibitor) two weeks before the presentation. She was initially treated as sepsis and required hemodialysis. Later on, metabolic acidosis was attributed to eDKA from dapagliflozin, which resolved after the administration of intravenous insulin. Her eDKA developed while she had already stopped dapagliflozin two weeks ago, which makes this an interesting case finding. It is one of those rare cases where dapagliflozin led to a delayed complication of eDKA."
41473675,"Analysis of PANoptosis-related genes in septic cardiomyopathy by bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation.",2026,"The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) are intricate and incompletely understood. PANoptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death, and in the present study, bioinformatics, machine learning and experimental validation were used to identify key PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) associated with SCM. Differentially expressed genes were obtained through analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, and these genes were intersected with the PRGs to obtain the differentially expressed PRGs. Three machine learning algorithms were used to screen key PRGs; CIBERSORT was used for immune infiltration analysis and the diagnostic value of key PRGs was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves. Additionally, a competitive endogenous (ce)RNA regulatory network analysis was conducted, and drug prediction analysis was performed. Finally, the expression of key PRGs was verified via quantitative PCR. A total of 157 differentially expressed genes and 21 differentially expressed PRGs were screened. In addition, two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm and the random forest algorithm, with both genes demonstrating a high diagnostic value. RIPK2 and GADD45B were positively correlated with neutrophils. The ceRNA regulatory network included two mRNAs, eight microRNAs and 16 long noncoding RNAs and 10 drugs/molecular compounds were predicted. Finally, quantitative PCR results revealed that the expression of both RIPK2 and GADD45B was upregulated in the lipopolysaccharide-induced HL-1 cell injury model. In conclusion, the present study identified two key PRGs (RIPK2 and GADD45B) associated with SCM; these findings may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for SCM."
20302024,Lethal perianal infection with septic shock: how should we manage this critical condition?,2009,"Some patients with perianal infection fall into a critical condition with severe sepsis and septic shock (lethal perianal infection). The objective of this study is to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of, and treatment strategies for, lethal perianal infection. The clinical records of 7 patients with lethal perianal infection were examined. For two rapidly dying cases (within 3 days), we performed resection of the rectum or local anal drainage as a primary management of damage control. These patients were transferred to our center because of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and had received insufficient fluid resuscitation in the previous hospital. Another nonsurviving case who died on the 16th day was transferred without MODS and underwent perianal drainage but could not recover from shock, even after repeated surgical procedures were performed. To prevent a perianal infection from becoming lethal, it should be managed as early as possible with sufficient fluid resuscitation with adequate drainage."
15590440,Fetal cardiac dysfunction in preterm premature rupture of membranes.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is associated with one-third of preterm births. In about 50% of preterm PROM cases, the fetuses will elicit a fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). FIRS is associated with the impending onset of preterm labor, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal sepsis, and long-term handicap, including the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and cerebral palsy. The fetal myocardium is a potential target organ of proinflammatory cytokines released during FIRS. The objective of this study was to determine whether preterm PROM is associated with functional changes in the fetal heart, as determined by fetal echocardiography. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to assess the diastolic function of fetuses with preterm PROM with documented microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (n = 25), preterm PROM without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (n = 42), and fetuses from normal pregnancies (control group = 150). Pregnancies with multiple gestation, fetal distress, fetuses that were small for gestational age, and major congenital anomalies were excluded. Fetal echocardiography studies were performed with two-dimensional ultrasound, color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Non-parametric statistics were used for comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures for micro-organisms in patients with preterm PROM was 35.8% (24/67). Ureaplasma urealyticum was the most frequent isolate, either alone (41.7%; 10/24) or with other micro-organisms (29.2%; 7/24). Fetuses with preterm PROM had a higher delta early diastolic filling/atrial contraction (E/A) peak velocity ratio, a higher delta E/A velocity-time integral (VTI) ratio, a lower delta A peak velocity, a lower delta A VTI, and a lower A VTI/total VTI ratio in the mitral valve compared to those with uncomplicated pregnancies. The delta E/A peak velocity ratio was significantly higher and the delta A VTI significantly lower in fetuses with preterm PROM and microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity than in those with preterm PROM without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm PROM is associated with changes in fetal cardiac function consistent with increased left ventricular compliance. These observations were also noted in fetuses with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity. Our findings suggest that fetal cardiac function is altered in preterm PROM and, in particular, in cases with intra-amniotic infection."
16088513,Corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.,2004,"Corticosteroids have been considered for decades for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock, based on their pivotal role in the stress response and their hemodynamic and antiinflammatory effects. Whereas short-term therapy with high doses of corticosteroids (up to 42 g hydrocortisone equivalent for 1-2 days) has been ineffective or potentially harmful, prolonged therapy with lower doses (200-300 mg hydrocortisone for 5-7 days or longer) in septic shock has recently revealed beneficial effects in several randomized, controlled trials. Assuming relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) and peripheral cortisol resistance, treatment with low-dose hydrocortisone improved shock reversal, reduced inflammation, and improved outcome. Shock reversal and reduction of mortality were more effective in patients with RAI, and most significant in patients with severe shock. Diagnosis of RAI with corticotropin tests in septic shock, however, is highly dependent on cut-off values and definition of RAI. Thus, it is not clear yet which patients benefit most from low-dose hydrocortisone and if treatment should be restricted to patients with RAI. In addition the role of fludrocortisone is uncertain. Nevertheless, based on current data, low-dose hydrocortisone therapy should definitely be considered in vasopressor-dependent septic shock. This review will address some critical points."
31916713,"The predictive value of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, presepsin, and soluble-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell levels in bloodstream infections in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia.",2019,"Ozdemir ZC, Duzenli-Kar Y, Canik A, Kusku-Kiraz Z, Ozen H, Bor O. The predictive value of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, presepsin, and soluble-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell levels in bloodstream infections in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 359-367. The present study investigates the predictive value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), presepsin (PRE-SEP) and soluble-triggering receptor, as expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1) levels in bloodstream infections in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia. A total of 47 episodes of febrile neutropenia that developed in 30 children with malignancy were analyzed in this study, while the control group comprised 27 children who had undergone chemotherapy for malignancy (completed >/=2 years ago) without neutropenia, fever or drug use. Median PCT, CRP, PRE-SEP and sTREM-1 levels on admission were found to be significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, while in the blood cultures, the microbiological agent was isolated in 13 (27.7%) of the 47 episodes. Median PCT and CRP levels on days 1, 2 and 7 were higher in the blood culture-positive episodes than in the blood culture-negative episodes. There was no significant difference in the PRE-SEP and sTREM-1 levels on days 1, 2 and 7 between the blood culture-positive and blood culture-negative episodes. The results of the study suggest that PRESEP and sTREM-1 are at measurable levels upon admission in children with febrile neutropenia, but that these markers may not be appropriate for the predicting of bloodstream infections, although CRP and PCT levels within the first 24 hours may serve as a guide for clinicians."
20014189,Endocarditis complicating central venous catheter bloodstream infections: a unique form of health care associated endocarditis.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Endocarditis complicating central venous catheter blood stream infection (CVC-BSI) is a serious complication and is being seen with increasing frequency. METHODS: All patients discharged from our institution with International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) codes of endocarditis and CVC-BSI were identified. The medical records of those meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed. RESULTS: From October 1, 1998 until December 31, 2006, 24 patients were identified with inpatient mortality of 20.8%. Nine cases were nosocomial and 15 were non-nosocomial. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (45.8%), chronic kidney disease (58.4%), prior valvular abnormalities (37.5%), and multiple prior hospitalizations (65.2%). There were 13 external lines, 9 tunneled lines, and 2 implantable ports. Responsible microorganisms included Staphylococcus aureus in 54.6%, coagulase-negative staphylococci in 37.5%, Candida species (spp.) in 16.6%, and enterococci in 12.5%. Five cases were polymicrobial. The line tip was within the right atrium (RA) in 37.5%, the superior vena cava (SVC)-RA junction in 20.8%, the SVC in 33.3%, and the pulmonary artery in 4.2% of patients. Sites of endocardial involvement were the aortic valve in 6 patients, mitral valve in 7 patients, tricuspid valve in 6 patients, right atrial wall in 11 patients, and pacemaker wire in 2 patients. Isolated right-sided involvement occurred in 50% of cases, isolated left-sided in 33.4%, and bilateral involvement in 16.6%. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was necessary for diagnosis in 10 cases (41.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis complicating CVC-BSI more often involves right-sided structures, with catheter tips in or near the right atrium, frequently requires TEE for diagnosis, and has significant inpatient mortality."
31831072,Predicting the clinical trajectory in critically ill patients with sepsis: a cohort study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: To develop a mathematical model to estimate daily evolution of disease severity using routinely available parameters in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Over a 3-year period, we prospectively enrolled consecutive adults with sepsis and categorized patients as (1) being at risk for developing (more severe) organ dysfunction, (2) having (potentially still reversible) limited organ failure, or (3) having multiple-organ failure. Daily probabilities for transitions between these disease states, and to death or discharge, during the first 2 weeks in ICU were calculated using a multi-state model that was updated every 2 days using both baseline and time-varying information. The model was validated in independent patients. RESULTS: We studied 1371 sepsis admissions in 1251 patients. Upon presentation, 53 (4%) were classed at risk, 1151 (84%) had limited organ failure, and 167 (12%) had multiple-organ failure. Among patients with limited organ failure, 197 (17%) evolved to multiple-organ failure or died and 809 (70%) improved or were discharged alive within 14 days. Among patients with multiple-organ failure, 67 (40%) died and 91 (54%) improved or were discharged. Treatment response could be predicted with reasonable accuracy (c-statistic ranging from 0.55 to 0.81 for individual disease states, and 0.67 overall). Model performance in the validation cohort was similar. CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model that estimates daily evolution of disease severity during sepsis may eventually support clinicians in making better informed treatment decisions and could be used to evaluate prognostic biomarkers or perform in silico modeling of novel sepsis therapies during trial design.

31868072,Sepsis and Septic Shock Definitions in Patients With Cancer Admitted in ICU.,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In 2016, a new definition of sepsis and septic shock was adopted. Some studies based on the general population demonstrated that the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is more accurate than the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to predict hospital mortality of infected patients requiring intensive care. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We have analyzed all the records of patients with cancer admitted for a suspected infection between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, in our oncological intensive care unit (ICU). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and quick SOFA (qSOFA) score as well as SIRS criteria were calculated. We analyzed the accuracy of each score to predict hospital mortality in the setting of the new and old definitions of septic shock. RESULTS: Our study includes 241 patients with a solid tumor and 112 with a hematological malignancy. The hospital mortality rate is 37% (68% in patients with septic shock according to the new definition and 60% according to old definition) between 2013 and 2016. To predict hospital mortality, the SOFA score has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.79), the qSOFA of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.70), and the SIRS criteria of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.52-0.63). In multivariate analysis, a higher SOFA score or a higher qSOFA score indicates poor prognosis: odds ratio (OR) per 1-point increase by 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.39) and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.04-2.11), respectively. Complete remission is a good prognostic factor for hospital mortality: OR 0.39 (95% CI, 0.22-0.67). CONCLUSION: The new definition of sepsis and septic shock is applicable in an ICU oncological population with the same reliability as in the general population. The SOFA score is more accurate than qSOFA and SIRS criteria to predict hospital mortality."
15576520,A low peripheral blood white blood cell count in infants younger than 90 days increases the odds of acute bacterial meningitis relative to bacteremia.,2004,"In relying on the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count to identify infants at high risk for acute bacterial meningitis and bacteremia, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it has not been reported previously whether high and low values of the test have similar implications for predicting these separate infections. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between the peripheral WBC count and the odds of acute bacterial meningitis relative to bacteremia among sick infants aged 3 to 89 days. METHODS: Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) and likelihood ratios at various intervals of the total peripheral blood WBC count were computed. RESULTS: A pathogen was isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 72 infants aged 3 to 89 days. Fifty-two infants had growth of a pathogen from the blood only, and 20 had growth from the CSF. The most common bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (32) and group B streptococci (32). The AUC for the peripheral WBC count when differentiating between acute bacterial meningitis and bacteremia was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.88). The odds of acute bacterial meningitis relative to bacteremia were sevenfold higher for a peripheral WBC cutoff below 5,000 cells/mm(3) and threefold lower for a peripheral WBC cutoff at or above 15,000 cells/mm(3). CONCLUSIONS: In young infants, the peripheral blood WBC count is useful for estimating the odds of acute bacterial meningitis relative to isolated bacteremia. A low peripheral blood WBC count should be considered a much more worrisome laboratory finding because it is associated with a relatively high risk for acute bacterial meningitis relative to the potential for bacteremia."
15598297,Escherichia coli: a growing problem in early onset neonatal sepsis.,2004,"AIMS: To review the demographic characteristics, antecedents and outcome for early neonatal Escherichia coli sepsis. Secondary aims were to identify antenatal antibiotic use and to review the antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all infants with a positive culture for E. coli from either blood or CSF samples obtained between January 1998 and October 2002. RESULTS: Nineteen liveborn infants with early onset sepsis and one stillborn baby with a positive maternal blood culture for E. coli were identified. Pregnancy complications included multiple pregnancy in five (25%), preterm rupture of membranes 10 (50%) and maternal urinary tract infection in five (25%). Eighteen of the cases were born preterm and two at term. The mortality was 8/20 (40%), and for nine cases with developmental outcome data available, 67% were within normal limits and 33% were abnormal. Of the 20 E. coli isolates 11 (55%) were resistant to amoxycillin and 1 (5%) was resistant to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with early onset E. coli sepsis had a poor outcome with high mortality and a third of the survivors manifesting neurodevelopmental impairment. Although amoxycillin resistance is common, there is a low prevalence of gentamicin resistance in local isolates."
15577752,"Treating opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",2004,"In 2001, CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America convened a working group to develop guidelines for therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated opportunistic infections to serve as a companion to the Guidelines for Prevention of Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Infected Persons. In recognition of unique considerations related to HIV infection among infants, children, and adolescents, a separate pediatric working group was established. Because HIV-infected women coinfected with opportunistic pathogens might be more likely to transmit these infections to their infants than women without HIV infection, guidelines for treating opportunistic pathogens among children should consider treatment of congentially acquired infections among both HIV-exposed but uninfected children and those with HIV infection. In addition, the natural history of opportunistic infections among HIV-infected children might differ from that among adults. Compared with opportunistic infections among HIV-infected adults, which are often caused by reactivation of pathogens acquired before HIV infection when host immunity was intact, opportunistic infections among children often reflect primary acquisition of the pathogen and, among children with perinatal HIV infection, infection acquired after HIV infection has been established and begun to compromise an already immature immune system. Laboratory diagnosis of opportunistic infections can be more difficult with children. Finally, treatment recommendations should consider differences between adults and children in terms of drug pharmacokinetics, dosing, formulations, administration, and toxicities. This report focuses on treatment of opportunistic infections that are common in HIV-exposed and infected infants, children, and adolescents in the United States."
20061592,Prevalence of extended- spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp in a neonatal intensive care unit.,2009,"This study reports the prevalence of extended-spectrum b-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp among septicemic neonates. Over a five year period, there were 94 isolates of Klebsiella spp and E .coli. Of these, 68 (72.3%) were ESBL producers. Forty (80%) of the Klebsiella spp isolates produced ESBL as compared to 28 (63.6%) of E.coli."
31851532,Serum amyloid A3 confers protection against acute lung injury in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected mice.,2020,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium associated with serious illnesses, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes in humans. Understanding the host immune mechanisms against P. aeruginosa is, therefore, of clinical importance. The present study identified serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) as being highly inducible in mouse bronchial epithelium following P. aeruginosa infection. Genetic deletion of Saa3 rendered mice more susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection with decreased neutrophil superoxide anion production, and ex vivo treatment of mouse neutrophils with recombinant SAA3 restored the ability of neutrophils to produce superoxide anions. The SAA3-deficient mice showed exacerbated inflammatory responses, which was characterized by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, elevated expression of TNF-alpha, KC/CXCL1, and MIP-2/CXCL2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and increased lung microvascular permeability compared with their wild-type littermates. BALF neutrophils from Saa3 knockout mice exhibited reduced superoxide anion production compared with neutrophils from wild-type mice. Adoptive transfer of SAA3-treated neutrophils to Saa3 knockout mice ameliorated P. aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury. These findings demonstrate that SAA3 not only serves as a biomarker for infection and inflammation, but also plays a protective role against P. aeruginosa infection-induced lung injury in part through augmentation of neutrophil bactericidal functions."
19940203,Central pontine myelinolysis secondary to hypokalaemic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.,2010,"Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) has been described in alcoholic patients and in the aftermath of rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia. We describe a case of CPM occurring secondary to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI), which developed as a consequence of severe hypokalaemia. A 63-year-old man with alcohol dependence was admitted to hospital with severe pulmonary sepsis and type 1 respiratory failure. On admission, he had euvolaemic hyponatraemia of 127 mmol/L, consistent with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secondary to his pneumonia. Following admission, his plasma potassium dropped from 3.2 to a nadir of 2.3 mmol/L. Mineralocorticoid excess, ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone production and other causes of hypokalaemia were excluded. The hypokalaemia provoked significant hypotonic polyuria and a slow rise in plasma sodium to 161 mmol/L over several days. Plasma glucose, calcium and creatinine were normal. The polyuria did not respond to desmopressin, and subsequent correction of his polyuria and hypernatraemia after normalization of plasma potassium confirmed the diagnosis of nephrogenic DI due to hypokalaemia. The patient remained obtunded, and the clinical suspicion of osmotic demyelination was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient remained comatose and passed away 10 days later. This is the first reported case of nephrogenic DI resulting in the development of CPM, despite a relatively slow rise in plasma sodium of less than 12 mmol/L/24 h. Coexisting alcohol abuse, hypoxaemia and hypokalaemia may have contributed significantly to the development of CPM in this patient."
41564562,A Comparison of Time to Sepsis Alert and Antibiotics in Emergency Department Patients by Language Preference.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have found increases in sepsis-related mortality among patients with non-English language preference (NELP) vs. English language preference (ELP) in the inpatient setting, even after controlling for demographic, illness severity, and clinical encounter variables. It is unclear if disparities in sepsis care extend to the emergency department. OBJECTIVE: We compared time to sepsis alert and antibiotics between patients with NELP vs. ELP overall and by emergency severity index (ESI) subgroup. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, the independent variable was preferred language, and the dependent variables were time to sepsis alert (clinician-initiated vs. automatic) and antibiotics. We developed multivariable adjusted plus inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: There were no overall differences in the time to sepsis alerts or time to antibiotic administration. In the ESI 2 subgroup, NELP patients had faster time to sepsis alert than ELP patients in clinician-initiated alerts (clinician-initiated: absolute difference: 17 min; covariate +IPTW: HR: 1.76, 99.44% CI 1.22, 2.54, p < 0.001). Within the ESI 3 to 5 subgroup, among patients with a clinician-initiated alert, NELP patients had slower time to sepsis alert than ELP patients (absolute difference: 17 min; covariate +IPTW: HR: 0.64, 99.44% CI 0.44, 0.94, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: While we found no overall differences in time to sepsis alert, there were significant differences in subgroups, suggesting that language preference may be associated with triage score assignment and sepsis recognition. The lack of differences observed in time to antibiotics underscores the potential for thoughtfully designed best practice alerts to support equitable clinical practice."
25867557,Systems for Paediatric Sepsis: A Global Survey.,2014,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the resources available for early diagnosis and treatment of paediatric sepsis at hospitals in developing and developed countries. METHODS: This was a voluntary online survey involving 101 hospitals from 41 countries solicited through the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies contact list and website. The survey was designed to assess the spectrum of sepsis epidemiology, patterns of applied therapies, availability of resources and barriers to optimal sepsis treatment. RESULTS: Ninety per cent of respondents represented a tertiary or general hospital with paediatric intensive care facilities, including 63% from developed countries. Adequate triage services were absent in more than 20% of centres. Insufficiently trained personnel and lack of a sepsis protocol was reported in 40% of all sites. While there were specific guidelines for sepsis management in 78% of centres (n = 100), protocols for assessing sepsis patients were not applied in nearly 70% of centres. Lack of parental recognition of sepsis and failure of referring centres to diagnose sepsis were identified as major barriers by more than 50% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Even among centres with no significant resource constraints and advanced medical systems, significant deficits in sepsis care exist. Early recognition and management remain a key issue and may be addressed through improved triage, augmented support for referring centres and public awareness. Focussed research is necessary at the institutional level to identify and address specific barriers."
16566699,Assessment of adrenocortical function in the critically ill.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To review current concepts in the diagnosis of adrenocortical disease in the critically ill patient. DATA SOURCES: A review of articles reported on adrenocortical insufficiency in the acutely ill patient. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: The contribution of adrenal insufficiency to the morbidity of critically ill patients is currently under renewed scrutiny. The debate continues about the role of steroids in sepsis and essentially the question remains unanswered. Central to this debate is the issue of whether adrenal insufficiency is common in the critically ill patient. What is incontrovertible is that adrenocortical function is essential for host survival during critical illness, but what constitutes adrenocortical insufficiency in critically ill patients is not clear. Absolute adrenocortical insufficiency (diagnosed by very low plasma cortisol concentrations) is uncommon in the intensive care population. The diagnosis of relative adrenocortical insufficiency (elevated basal plasma cortisol with a subnormal increase in plasma concentrations following an ACTH stimulus) continues to generate debate. The controversy surrounding the role of steroids in sepsis and the confusion over the criteria for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the following caveats be borne in mind when diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill patient. Firstly, the gold standard for the diagnosis has not been established. Secondly, caution must be exercised when interpreting a single plasma cortisol value. In the event of a single result indicating adrenal hypofunction, we suggest repeating the measurements after a 6 to 12 hour interval. The clinician must also be aware of variations in cortisol concentrations induced by the assay. Thirdly, the clinician must be aware of the potential limitations of the conventional high dose corticotrophin test. We also suggest that plasma free cortisol is more relevant than total plasma cortisol in the assessment of adrenal function in critical illness and that the low dose corticotrophin test is more sensitive than the conventional high dose test. These areas should be the subject of further investigations."
25506031,"Necrotising myositis, the deadly impersonator.",2014,"We report two cases of patients with necrotising myositis who presented initially with limb pain and swelling on a background of respiratory complaints. Patient 1, a previously well 38-year-old female, underwent various investigations in the emergency department for excessive lower limb pain and a skin rash. Patient 2, a 61-year-old female with a background of rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension, presented to accident and emergency feeling generally unwell and was treated for presumed respiratory sepsis. Both deteriorated rapidly and were referred to the plastic surgery team with soft tissue necrosis, impending multiorgan failure and toxaemia. Large areas of necrotic muscle and skin were debrided, which grew group A streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes. Patient 1 had a high above knee amputation of the left leg with extensive debridement of the right. Despite aggressive surgical intervention and microbiological input with intensive care support, patient 2 died. These two cases highlight the importance of early diagnosis and prompt surgical and pharmacological intervention in managing this life-threatening disease. Pain is the primary symptom with skin changes being a late and subtle sign in a septic patient. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) may be of use if there is concern to aid diagnosis of this life-threatening disease."
41416069,The diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III activity for sepsis-induced coagulopathy in septic patients: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), therefore, studying the diagnostic and prognostic value of antithrombin III (AT-III) activity in SIC may be useful for early identification and intervention of SIC. METHODS: This study is a single-center cohort study, prospectively enrolling patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU from March 2023 to March 2024. Based on whether the SIC score was greater than or equal to 4, the enrolled sepsis patients were divided into the SIC group and the non-SIC group. The SIC scoring system consists of three parameters: International normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The measurement of AT-III activity was completed within 12 h of the patient being admitted to the ICU. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of different biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of SIC. The DeLong Test was employed to compare whether there was a significant difference between AUCs. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted and Log-rank test was performed to compare the 28-day survival rates among different groups. RESULTS: This study included a total of 366 patients with sepsis, among which 235 (64.2%) were in the SIC group and 131 (35.8%) were in the non-SIC group. The AT-III activity in the SIC group was significantly lower than that in the non-SIC group (P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC for AT-III activity was 0.799 (P < 0.001), the AUC for platelets was 0.806 (P < 0.001), the AUC for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 0.746 (P < 0.001), and the AUC for international normalized ratio (INR) was 0.765 (P < 0.001). The results of the DeLong Test showed that the AUC for AT-III activity in diagnosing SIC had no statistically significant difference compared with the AUCs of the traditional diagnostic indicators, including platelets, SOFA score, and INR (P > 0.05). The cut-off value of AT-III activity for diagnosing SIC is 59.7%, with a sensitivity of 79.91%, specificity of 69.77%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 82.59%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 65.94%. There was no statistical difference in AT-III activity between the survival and non-survival groups of SIC patients (P > 0.05). The proportion of shock and the duration of vasopressor use were both lower in the high AT-III group (>/= 59.7%) than in the low AT-III group < 59.7%) (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the 28-day survival probability between the high AT-III group and the low AT-III group (P = 0.350). CONCLUSION: AT-III activity is a potentially helpful adjunctive biomarker for diagnosing SIC that performs similarly to the biomarkers and scores currently used to diagnose SIC."
19947416,"[Determination of the concentration of C-reactive protein, oligopeptides and lactoferrin of blood as a method of early diagnosis of mesenchymal sepsis].",2009,"The investigation of results of treatment included the observation of 2250 patients with pyo-necrotic diseases of soft tissues. For the early diagnosis of sepsis the indices of C-reactive protein, oligopeptides and lactoferrin of blood were used. In the presence of one or more symptoms of the systemic inflammatory reaction the level of the indices was increased from 1.1-3.1 up to 4-7 times depending on the degree of the systemic response severity. When the inflammatory process was local the data of the markers remain normal. These markers allow the confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of sepsis, assessment of the degree of the systemic inflammatory reaction and prognosis of the disease."
41404875,Precise species identification and whole-genome sequencing analysis of Enterobacter cloacae complex causing bloodstream infections in China.,2026,"The Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired infections. However, achieving accurate species identification and comprehensive resistance profiling remains difficult in clinical practice, with a limited understanding of species-specific resistance patterns. ECC isolates were collected from patients with bloodstream infections at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2015 and 2020. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify species, analyze antimicrobial resistance genes, and explore genomic variation in serial isolates. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profiles were extracted from the WGS data. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on hsp60 sequences. Eleven hsp60 clusters were identified, with cluster VIII being the most prevalent (28/108). Average nucleotide identity (ANI)-based species classification showed Enterobacter hormaechei (31.5%) and Enterobacter xiangfangensis (15.7%) were dominant species. Five clade-cluster pairs (B-VIII, A-VI, G-XI, D-III, R-IX) accounted for 74% of isolates. A total of 90 sequence types (STs) were detected, including 29 novel STs. Resistance gene analysis revealed a high prevalence of bla(ACT), with distinct distribution patterns observed among different species. Twenty isolates were carbapenem-resistant, with three carrying bla(NDM-1/5). Enterobacter roggenkampii was the most common species (5/20) among all carbapenem-resistant isolates, and 83.3% of the isolates showed resistance to both carbapenems and colistin. Comparative genomics of longitudinal isolates from individual patients revealed adaptive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pco genes. This study provides a detailed genomic characterization of ECC isolates from bloodstream infections, highlighting species diversity, resistance gene distribution, and potential within-host evolution. These insights advocate genome-based surveillance in managing ECC infections and understanding resistance evolution in clinical contexts.IMPORTANCEEnterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) is a major cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, yet species-level identification and resistance profiling remain challenging. As one of the largest whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based studies of ECC bloodstream isolates in northern China to date, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 108 ECC isolates, revealing high genetic diversity and identifying 29 novel sequence types. We clarified the correspondence between species, clades, and clusters and highlighted Enterobacter roggenkampii as a potential high-risk species linked to carbapenem and colistin resistance. Our findings not only improve the understanding of ECC population structure and resistance evolution in China but also provide valuable genomic data for future epidemiological surveillance and species-level diagnostics."
31903057,"Disease Spectrum and Frequency of Illness in Pediatric Emergency: A Retrospective Analysis From Karachi, Pakistan.",2019,"Background: The National Institute of Child Health (NICH) is the largest tertiary care pediatric hospital operating in Karachi, Pakistan. Its emergency department (ED) is always occupied. However, the spectrum of illness in patients presenting to this ED has not been investigated in depth to identify the most common presentations and to develop effective management for treating patients. Methods: This retrospective study included all children visiting the pediatric ED of the NICH from January 2017 through December 2017. Newborns to children 14 years of age were included, for a total cohort of 188,803 patients. Sociodemographic data and clinical information were extracted from the medical record. Univariate analysis was performed to determine the frequency and percentage for all the variables. Results: The cohort consisted of 9% (n=16,952) neonates (0 to 1 month) and 91% (n=171,351) older children (>1 month to 14 years). Among the neonates, 36.6% presented as triage level 1. Sepsis was diagnosed in 23.8% of neonates, low birth weight/preterm in 18.4%, and respiratory distress/pneumonia in 15.2%. In infants and older children, diagnoses related to the respiratory system (37.3%), gastrointestinal system (16.4%), and multisystem involvement (15.9%) were the most common. During the evening shifts, 38.1% of patients were seen, and on weekends, 51.6% of patients were seen. Sunday was the busiest day in the ED. Conclusion: The tertiary care pediatric EDs in Pakistan have witnessed an increasing number of critical emergencies over time. Respiratory and gastrointestinal emergencies form the majority of the ED burden. A surge of patients is seen on the weekends and during the evening shifts. The spectrum of illnesses should be investigated via prospective, longitudinal studies in other pediatric EDs in Pakistan to understand the trends and to provide the foundation for developing nationwide recommendations for improving pediatric emergency care."
25527094,The efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. They are characterized by excessive inflammation, upregulation of procoagulant proteins and depletion of natural anticoagulants. Plasma exchange has the potential to improve survival in sepsis by removing inflammatory cytokines and restoring deficient plasma proteins. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange in patients with sepsis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, reference lists of relevant articles, and grey literature for relevant citations. We included randomized controlled trials comparing plasma exchange or plasma filtration with usual care in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock. Two reviewers independently identified trials, extracted trial-level data and performed risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality reported at longest follow-up. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of 1,957 records identified, we included four unique trials enrolling a total of 194 patients (one enrolling adults only, two enrolling children only, one enrolling adults and children). The mean age of adult patients ranged from 38 to 53 years (n = 128) and the mean age of children ranged from 0.9 to 18 years (n = 66). All trials were at unclear to high risk of bias. The use of plasma exchange was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52, I(2) 60%). In adults, plasma exchange was associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96; I(2) 0%), but was not in children (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.38; I(2) 60%). None of the trials reported ICU or hospital lengths of stay. Only one trial reported adverse events associated with plasma exchange including six episodes of hypotension and one allergic reaction to fresh frozen plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence exists to recommend plasma exchange as an adjunctive therapy for patients with sepsis or septic shock. Rigorous randomized controlled trials evaluating clinically relevant patient-centered outcomes are required to evaluate the impact of plasma exchange in this condition."
31866181,Impact of allogeneic blood transfusions on clinical outcomes in severely burned patients.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic blood transfusions are common in the treatment of severely burned patients as surgery may lead to major blood loss. However, transfusions are associated with a number of adverse events. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of allogeneic blood transfusions on clinical outcomes in severely burned patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult patients admitted to the burn center of the University Hospital Zurich between January 2004 and December 2014, with burn injuries greater than 10% of total body surface area and receiving both surgical and intensive care treatment. Primary Endpoints were infectious or thromboembolic complications and mortality and secondary endpoints were length of hospital and ICU stay. Simple and multivariable logistic and linear regression models, adjusted for injury severity and confounders, were applied. RESULTS: 413 patients met inclusion criteria of which 212 patients (51%) received allogenic blood products. After adjustment for injury severity and confounders, red blood cell transfusion was independently associated with wound infection (OR 13.5, 95% CI 1.7-107, p = 0.014), sepsis (OR 8.3, 4.2-16.3; p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR 4.7, 2.2-10.0; p < 0.001), thrombosis (OR 3.0, 1.2-7.4; p = 0.015), central line infection (OR 34.7, 4.6-260; p = 0.001) and a longer ICU and hospital stay (difference 17.7, CI 12.1-23.4, p < 0.001 and 22.0, 15.8-28.2, p < 0.001, respectively). Fresh frozen plasma transfusion was independently associated with a longer ICU and hospital stay (difference 13.7, 95% CI 5.5-21.8, p = 0.001 and 13.5, 4.6-22.5, p = 0.003, respectively). Platelet transfusion was independently associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (OR 4.5, 1.3-15.5; p = 0.018) and mortality (OR 5.8, 2.1-16.0; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of allogeneic blood products is associated with an increased infection rate and thromboembolic morbidity and a longer hospital stay in severely burned patients."
19946500,Gluteal compartment syndrome: a case report.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Gluteal compartment syndrome is a rare, often unrecognized syndrome that may manifest as renal failure, sepsis, and death. Delay in diagnosis can result in significant morbidity and possible mortality. We report a case of occult gluteal compartment syndrome causing unresolving rhabdomyolysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old Caucasian American man with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted status post fall and loss of consciousness for an unknown duration. Initial work-up revealed severe rhabdomyolysis, opioid abuse and acute renal failure. Inspite of three days of intensive therapy his condition did not improve and his renal failure worsened. On improvement of his condition three days later, he indicated some discomfort in his right hip. Physical examination was significant for swelling of the right gluteal region, which was tender and firm on palpation. A non-contrast CT scan showed evidence of gluteal compartment syndrome and emergent surgery resulted in significant improvement of his condition. CONCLUSION: Gluteal compartment syndrome most commonly occurs in individuals with altered mental status due to drugs or alcohol, who remain in one position for an extended period of time. This prolonged compression leads to muscle damage, edema, and a full-blown compartment syndrome. Due to its anatomic location and rarity, diagnosis is often missed or delayed, resulting in significant morbidity and possible mortality. The mainstay of treatment is fasciotomy."
41436952,Quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines for sepsis and variations in recommendations.,2025,"BACKGROUND: To provide a clinical reference, we assessed the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for sepsis management in adults and compared their key recommendations. METHODS: Relevant CPGs for adult sepsis management were identified through searches of electronic databases, guideline repositories, and professional societies from January 1, 2018, to March 1, 2025. The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-Recommendation Excellence (AGREE-REX) were used to evaluate the methodological quality of CPGs and the quality of recommendations. Key recommendations were comprehensively extracted and compared. RESULTS: A total of 11 CPGs were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) scores for AGREE II domain were: scope and purpose, 88.89% (77.78-94.44%); stakeholder involvement, 83.33% (50.00-88.89%); rigor of development, 58.33% (50.00-83.33%); clarity of presentation, 94.40% (88.89-94.44%); applicability, 45.83% (33.33-66.67%); and editorial independence, 66.67% (58.33-91.67%). The AGREE-REX assessment indicated clinical applicability at 70.83% (63.89-83.33%), implementability at 58.33% (47.92-64.58%), and values and preferences at 30.21% (25.00-39.58%). In total, 552 key recommendations were extracted. Among guidelines utilizing the GRADE system, the proportion of evidence categorized as low (Grade C; n = 97, 40.93%) and very low quality (Grade D; n = 66, 27.85%) was substantially higher than that of high (Grade A; n = 15, 6.33%) and moderate-quality (Grade B; n = 59, 24.89%) evidence. Furthermore, weak recommendations (n = 168, 70.89%) were markedly more prevalent than strong recommendations (n = 69, 29.11%). Although guidelines for sepsis diagnosis were generally consistent, evidence gaps in hemodynamic management and antibiotic use led to controversial recommendations. CONCLUSION: Treatment strategies for sepsis vary across guidelines and remain inconsistent. The quality of CPGs for sepsis management requires improvement, particularly in applicability and values and preferences. Future CPG developers should adhere strictly to standardized methodologies and focus on enhancing the dissemination and implementation of guidelines. In this study, we lay the foundation for future guideline development, aiming to synthesize evidence-based insights for clinical decision-making.

20015490,Transabdominal amnioinfusion in preterm premature rupture of membranes.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of transabdominal amnioinfusion on prolongation of pregnancy, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM). METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study of women with pPROM during singleton live pregnancy-between 26 and 33+6weeks-whose amniotic fluid index (AFI) was less than the 5th percentile. The study group underwent transabdominal amnioinfusion at admission and then weekly if their AFI fell below the 5th percentile again. The control group received expectant management. RESULTS: The difference in the mean interval from pPROM to delivery between the groups was not statistically significant. Neonatal and maternal outcomes were significantly improved in the study group compared with the control group (fetal distress [10% vs 37%]; early neonatal sepsis [17% vs 63%]; neonatal mortality [17% vs 63%]; spontaneous delivery [83% vs 53%]; and postpartum sepsis [7% vs 33%]). CONCLUSION: Transabdominal amnioinfusion reduced fetal distress, early neonatal sepsis, and neonatal mortality. In the study group, more participants delivered spontaneously and there were fewer cases of postpartum sepsis, although the pPROM-delivery interval was not increased."
15693962,Effect of magnesium sulfate administration on blood-brain barrier in a rat model of intraperitoneal sepsis: a randomized controlled experimental study.,2005,"INTRODUCTION: Permeability changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their possible contribution to brain edema formation have a crucial role in the pathophysiology of septic encephalopathy. Magnesium sulfate has been shown to have a protective effect on BBB integrity in multiple experimental models. In this study we determine whether magnesium sulfate administration could have any protective effects on BBB derangement in a rat model of sepsis. METHODS: This randomized controlled experimental study was performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intraperitoneal sepsis was induced by using the infected fibrin-thrombin clot model. To examine the effect of magnesium in septic and sham-operated rats, a dose of 750 micromol/kg magnesium sulfate was given intramuscularly immediately after surgery. Control groups for both infected and sham-operated rats were injected with equal volume of saline. Those rats surviving for 24 hours were anesthetized and decapitated for the investigation of brain tissue specific gravity and BBB integrity by the spectrophotometric assay of Evans blue dye extravasations. Another set of experiments was performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis. Rats were allocated into four parallel groups undergoing identical procedures. RESULTS: Sepsis significantly increased BBB permeability to Evans blue. The dye content of each hemisphere was significantly lower in the magnesium-treated septic rats (left hemisphere, 0.00218 +/- 0.0005; right hemisphere, 0.00199 +/- 0.0007 [all results are means +/- standard deviation]) than in control septic animals (left hemisphere, 0.00466 +/- 0.0002; right hemisphere, 0.00641 +/- 0.0003). In septic animals treated with magnesium sulfate, specific gravity was higher (left hemisphere, 1.0438 +/- 0.0007; right hemisphere, 1.0439 +/- 0.0004) than in the untreated septic animals (left hemisphere, 1.0429 +/- 0.0009; right hemisphere, 1.0424 +/- 0.0012), indicating less edema formation with the administration of magnesium. A significant decrease in plasma magnesium levels was observed 24 hours after the induction of sepsis. The dose of magnesium that we used maintained the baseline plasma magnesium levels in magnesium-treated septic rats. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium administration attenuated the increased BBB permeability defect and caused a reduction in brain edema formation in our rat model of intraperitoneal sepsis."
15614942,"Infrascrotal, perineal, femorofemoral bypass for arterial graft infection at the groin.",2004,"HYPOTHESIS: Infrascrotal, perineal, femorofemoral bypass is an acceptable procedure for treating infection of a prosthetic arterial graft limited to a unilateral groin. DESIGN: A consecutive sample clinical study with a mean follow-up of 29 months. SETTING: The surgical department of an academic tertiary care center and an affiliated secondary care center. PATIENTS: Nineteen patients with a mean age of 68 years with prosthetic graft infection at the outflow anastomosis on a femoral artery at the Scarpa triangle underwent an infrascrotal, perineal, femorofemoral bypass, with excision of the graft material limited at the groin. The recipient artery was the profunda femoris artery in 12 cases, the superficial femoral in 5, and the distal common femoral artery in 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative survival, recurrence of sepsis, primary graft patency, and limb salvage rates expressed by standard life-table analysis. RESULTS: Postoperative mortality rate was 5%. Cumulative (SE) survival rate was 65% (11.6%) at 3 years. Cumulative (SE) rate of freedom from recurrent sepsis was 88% (8.6%) at 3 years. Cumulative (SE) primary patency and limb salvage rates were 86% (9.4%) and 91% (7.9%), respectively, at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Femorofemoral bypass with an infrascrotal perineal approach is a valuable procedure for the treatment of femoral arterial graft infection limited at a unilateral groin."
19959189,Effects of ethyl pyruvate and other alpha-keto carboxylic acid derivatives in a rat model of multivisceral ischemia and reperfusion.,2011,"BACKGROUND: Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has been shown to ameliorate hepatic, renal, and intestinal mucosal injury and down-regulate expression of several pro-inflammatory mediators in a wide variety of preclinical models of critical illnesses, such as sepsis, burn injury, acute pancreatitis, stroke, and hemorrhagic shock. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effects of EP remain poorly understood, but might be related to the compound's structure as the ester of an alpha-keto carboxylic acid. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that EP and other alpha-keto carboxylic acid derivatives can modulate organ injury after lower torso ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). METHODS: Rats were subjected to 50 min of supraceliac aortic occlusion. Over a 20-min period, starting 2 min before the release of the aortic clamp, the animals received 2 muL/g of Ringer's lactate solution (RL, n = 5) or an equivalent volume of a solution containing EP (n = 5), benzoyl formate (BF, n = 5), parahydroxyphenyl pyruvate (PHPP, n = 5) or sodium pyruvate (NaPyr, n = 5). The total dose of each compound was 0.86 mMol/kg. After 1h of reperfusion, we measured ileal mucosal permeability to fluorescein-labeled dextran (mw 4000 Da), liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and TNF. Rats in the control group (CT, n = 4) were subjected to laparotomy and surgical isolation of the supraceliac aorta, but not visceral I/R. RESULTS: Ileal mucosal permeability, plasma levels of ALT and TNF, and hepatic MDA content increased significantly in the RL group relative to the CT group. Both EP and BF significantly ameliorated the development of systemic arterial hypotension, mucosal hyperpermeability, and significantly decreased plasma levels of TNF. MDA content was significantly decreased by EP, PHPP, BF, and NaPyr. CONCLUSIONS: In general, EP is more efficacious in this model than is NaPyr. Although more remains to be learned about the pharmacologic differences between EP and pyruvate, one important factor may the greater lipophilicity of the former compound. This insight may permit the development of even more effective cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory agents based on the pyruvoyl moiety."
41460795,Analysis of blood culture practices in multicenter university-affiliated hospitals in Korea: A retrospective study focused on procedural optimization.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Blood culture is an essential diagnostic tool for detecting bloodstream infections, particularly in patients with suspected sepsis. Routine implementation in healthcare settings necessitates adherence to standardized protocols to ensure diagnostic accuracy. We assessed blood culture practices in university-affiliated hospitals across Korea by analyzing key performance metrics and related indicators. METHODS: In 2024, a standardized questionnaire was distributed to 14 university-affiliated hospitals. The survey collected data on blood culture practices during 2023, including the total number of cultures performed, the number of sets obtained per episode, the frequency of repeated cultures, the volume of blood collected per bottle, discrepancies in culture results, the types of organisms isolated, and post-test reporting practices. RESULTS: In 2023, the median number of blood cultures requested per 1,000 hospitalized patients was 166.6 (43,699 cultures among 241,053 admissions). Two-set collections were most common (median 68.9%), followed by single-set collections (13.0%). Repeat cultures were more frequently performed following negative results (29.2%) than positive ones (5.5%). The median volume collected was 4.0 and 4.3 mL for aerobic and anaerobic bottles, respectively. Only 16.7% of Gram stain results were reported within 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: Blood culture practices, particularly regarding test ordering and the use of two or more sets per episode, appear generally appropriate. However, specific aspects-including the indications for repeat cultures, adequacy of collected blood volume, and timeliness of Gram stain reporting-require further evaluation and targeted quality improvement efforts."
15666028,[Severe sepsis and septic shock in children with cancer].,2004,"BACKGROUND: This report describes the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents bearers of oncological disease who were admitted to PICU with severe sepsis and septic shock. The predicting factors for mortality and for need of pulmonary mechanical ventilation were also determined. METHODS: Thirty-three children diagnosed with severe sepsis and septic shock were evaluated prospectively at the PICU of Hospital do Cancer between June and December of 2001. RESULTS: Thirty-three admissions were analyzed during this period; ages ranged from 1 to 23 years; 16 (48%) were boys and 17 (52%) were girls. Twenty patients had leukemia/lymphoma and 13 patients had solid tumors. Twenty-eight patients had a diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 73% of the patients, infection germs were isolated and gram negative organisms were responsible for 67% of the samples. Respiratory support was necessary for 18 patients (54%), inotropic support for 22 (67%) and dialysis for four patients. The mortality rate was of 41% for patients who needed inotropic support, of 69% for those requiring respiratory support and of 100% for those with an indication for dialysis. The overall mortality rate was of 27%. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that early intensive treatment for children with cancer exhibiting severe sepsis and/or septic shock could be an important factor to influence the mortality rate of these patients. Moreover, that noninvasive ventilation could be an option to reduce endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation."
15599753,Lemierre's syndrome: three cases and a review.,2005,"Postanginal sepsis, also called Lemierre's syndrome, is a rare but acute medical condition complicating oropharyngeal infection. The pathogenesis consists of the development of internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis leading to metastatic infections in the lung and other sites. The causative microorganism is most often Fusobacterium necrophorum. We present three patients with Lemierre's syndrome who presented to the Leiden University Medical Center and give a review of the literature."
41492616,Biliary Sepsis Caused by Burkholderia cepacia: A Rare Presentation.,2025,"Burkholderia cepacia is notorious for causing nosocomial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, while extrapulmonary infections remain uncommon. We report the case of a 53-year-old man recently diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with liver and spine metastases who initially presented with obstructive jaundice. Laboratory workup revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Baseline chest X-ray showed a soft tissue density in the left lower lobe, and dynamic liver CT demonstrated multiple liver nodules suspicious for metastasis. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent insertion. Post-procedure, the patient developed a fever. He was managed as a case of cholangitis and started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Blood cultures grew B. cepacia, which was sensitive to meropenem, levofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole; therefore, antibiotics were shifted to meropenem. Despite this, he remained febrile. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed dilatation of both the hepatic and common bile ducts with the stent in place. The team proceeded with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Bile cultures again grew B. cepacia with the same sensitivities. Repeat blood cultures remained positive, so levofloxacin was added to meropenem. Two days after starting the combination regimen, the patient became afebrile. Subsequent blood cultures showed clearance. He was discharged in stable condition with two weeks of oral levofloxacin. B. cepacia should be considered a possible causative agent of nosocomial biliary tract infections in immunocompromised patients."
19956711,Canine uterine bacterial infection induces upregulation of proteolysis-related genes and downregulation of homeobox and zinc finger factors.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection with the severe complication of sepsis is a frequent and serious condition, being a major cause of death worldwide. To cope with the plethora of occurring bacterial infections there is therefore an urgent need to identify molecular mechanisms operating during the host response, in order both to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention and to identify biomarkers for disease. Here we addressed this issue by studying global gene expression in uteri from female dogs suffering from spontaneously occurring uterine bacterial infection. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The analysis showed that almost 800 genes were significantly (p<0.05) upregulated (>2-fold) in the uteri of diseased animals. Among these were numerous chemokine and cytokine genes, as well as genes associated with inflammatory cell extravasation, anti-bacterial action, the complement system and innate immune responses, as well as proteoglycan-associated genes. There was also a striking representation of genes associated with proteolysis. Robust upregulation of immunoglobulin components and genes involved in antigen presentation was also evident, indicating elaboration of a strong adaptive immune response. The bacterial infection was also associated with a significant downregulation of almost 700 genes, of which various homeobox and zinc finger transcription factors were highly represented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these finding outline the molecular patterns involved in bacterial infection of the uterus. The study identified altered expression of numerous genes not previously implicated in bacterial disease, and several of these may be evaluated for potential as biomarkers of disease or as therapeutic targets. Importantly, since humans and dogs show genetic similarity and develop diseases that share many characteristics, the molecular events identified here are likely to reflect the corresponding situation in humans afflicted by similar disease."
15722992,"Real-time, contrast-enhanced sonographic imaging in emergency radiology.",2004,"PURPOSE: To report our pilot experience in the evaluation of traumatic and nontraumatic emergencies with contrast-specific, continuous-mode sonography (US) and a second-generation contrast medium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2003 we evaluated 126 acute patients by using real-time contrast-specific US: blunt abdominal trauma (76 cases), penetrating abdominal trauma (3), blunt scrotal trauma (1), right upper abdominal pain (10), left upper abdominal pain (9), epigastric pain (2), flank pain (5), right lower abdominal pain (2), scrotal pain (7), postoperative abdominal sepsis (1), post-biopsy haemorrhage (1), ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (8), postsurgical aortic bleeding (1). In all cases the radiologist performed a complete baseline US survey and then decided whether or not to add a contrast-enhanced examination. RESULTS: All contrast-enhanced sonographic studies were completed proving to be adequate for diagnostic purposes and without adverse reactions to contrast medium. There were 40 true negatives. The final diagnosis, obtained in 85 positive cases out of 86, was: splenic injury (28 cases), hepatic injury (3), renal injury (3), multiple injuries (3), pancreatic and portal vein injury (1), colonic-mesocolic injury (1), testicular trauma (1), hepatic abscess (9), hepatic ischaemia (1), gangrenous cholecystitis (1), splenic infarction (8), splenic haematoma abscess (1), renal infection (4), renal infarction (1), necrotizing pancreatitis (1), post-biopsy haemorrhage (1), appendicitis (2), peritoneal abscesses (1), testicular torsion (6), orchiepididymitis (1), iliac artery dissection (1), ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (6), aortic periprosthetic hemorrhage (1). Out of 85 positive cases, agreement between baseline US and contrast-specific US was absent in 8% of cases, low in 26%, intermediate in 42%, and high in 24%. Baseline US had 3 false positives. Relevance of contrast-specific US was absent in 17% of cases, low (additional data not relevant for patient management) in 26%, intermediate (relevant additional data not modifying patient management) in 34%, and high (additional data modifying patient management) in 23%. Agreement between contrast-specific US and the gold standards was absent in 0% of cases, low in 6%, intermediate in 38%, and high in 56%. Contrast-specific US had 2 false positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time contrast-specific US is an effective technique in emergency imaging. Its role should not be considered as a replacement of CT (though in some instances it can be considered a valuable alternative) but as a useful integration of conventional US. By always having the opportunity to add contrast-enhanced imaging, in case of interpretation doubts or diagnostic difficulties, the radiologist can assess the emergency patient with improved confidence and skill."
41503625,[Revision Arthroplasty for Periprosthetic Femoral Fracture Complicated by Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli: Case Report and Minireview].,2025,"Periprosthetic infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria are one of the most fearsome complications in current orthopedics. Despite using aseptic modern practices, the number of infectious complications caused by multidrug-resistant strains is rising worldwide. We present a case of a woman with a non-healing wound after hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed in Egypt for periprosthetic femoral fracture. Upon admission, 11 days after surgery, she presented with a purulent secretion from surgical wound and signs of sepsis. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli was proven from a wound swab. Two-stage revision with a 6-week-long interval of targeted parenteral antibiotic therapy was indicated. During explantation, excessive femoral bone loss after inadequately performed trauma revision surgery was discovered. After antibiotic hip spacer period, the patient underwent implantation of a cemented tumorous revision hip implant followed by 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged in more than satisfactory condition, being self-sufficient using French crutches. In follow-up visits during next 2 years, no relapse of carbapenem-resistant infection occurred. In patients hospitalized or operated in high-risk areas, epidemiological anamnesis is of great importance and the possibility of importing multi-resistant bacteria should be considered. Infections caused by these bacteria prolong therapy and increase the cost of treatment significantly. The combination of arthroplasty extraction and targeted antibiotic therapy is recommended to treat periprosthetic infections."
31839522,Presentation and outcomes of end stage liver disease patients presenting with septic shock to the emergency department.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) are particularly vulnerable to sepsis. ESLD patients are often excluded from controlled sepsis trials and more data are needed to guide the management of this population. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical factors and outcomes of patients with ESLD presenting to the emergency department (ED) with septic shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients registered in our dedicated ED adult septic shock pathway. All patients registered between January 2014 and May 2016 were included. Clinical and treatment variables for ESLD patients were compared with non-ESLD patients. A second analysis assessed ESLD survivors compared to non-survivors. RESULTS: 2,584 septic shock patients were enrolled. ESLD was present in 6.2% (n = 161) of patients. Patients with ESLD had higher mortality compared to patients without ESLD 36.6% vs 21.2% (p < 0.001). ESLD patients were more likely to be younger, female, obese, and have other comorbidities. ESLD patients exhibited lower temperature, higher lactate, and higher incidence of acute kidney injury. There was no difference in antibiotics or fluid resuscitation between groups. ESLD patients received more ED vasopressor support. Among ESLD septic shock patients, maximum lactate and presence of pneumonia were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESLD comprise a small but important subgroup of patients with ED septic shock that experience high mortality compared to patients without ESLD. Maximum ED lactate and pneumonia as the source of sepsis are independently associated with adverse outcome and may be used for early recognition of high-risk ESLD sepsis patients."
15637985,[C-reactive protein concentrations during initial (empiric) treatment of neonatal sepsis].,2001,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal septicaemia is characterized by high mortality so that intravenous antibiotics must be administered on clinical suspicion. Initial antibiotic therapy, before the results of microbiological evaluation, is based on empirical data in regard to sensitivity of prevalent bacterial strains. In the past years, aetiological causes of neonatal sepsis have been changed with an increased bacterial resistance to the usual combination of initial antibiotics. AIM: We compared changes of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in neonates with proven neonatal sepsis in response to initial antibiotic therapy (inappropriate or appropriate). Our hypothesis was that changes of CRP levels during the first 48 hours of treatment and before microbiologic results could be useful in evaluation of effectiveness of empiric antibiotics. METHODS: Our prospective study included all neonates with suspected sepsis referred to our Intensive Care Unit from January 1992 to December 1996. Neonates received ampicillin and gentamycin/or amikacin (during the first week of life), while infants older than 7 days of life were given combination of cloxacillin and aminoglycozides. In patients with late neonatal sepsis who also had meninigitis, cloxacillin was substituted with ampicillin. Microbiological identification was performed with routine bacteriological methods. Susceptibility of isolated bacterial strains to antibiotics was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. Serum concentration of CRP was measured by immunoturbidimetry (Turbox CRP, Orion Diagnostica) and CRP concentration higher than 20 mg/l was regarded as elevated. Blood sampling for CRP measurements were taken before the treatment (CRP0), and during the first (CRP1) and second (CRP2) day of empiric therapy. The interval between sampling was from 12 to 24 hours. RESULTS: A total of 1520 neonates were evaluated during this study period and 47 patients fulfilled criteria for final analysis. In 14 of 47 patients initial antibiotic treatment was inappropriate. The most frequent resistant strains was KI. pneumoniae (6) followed with St. aureus (4), E. coli (2) and Pseudomonas (2). During initial evaluation six patients had concomitant meningitis while two had concomitant septic arthritis and two necrotizing enterocolitis, respectively. Seven (50%) of 14 patients with non-adequate initial treatment died. In 33 cases of adequately treated septicaemia the course was uncomplicated and no lethal outcome was observed. In the first group of 14 patients who received inappropriate treatment serum CRP concentations (mg/L; mean and +/- SD) were: CRP0 = 107.5 +/- 65.6; CRP1 = 155.3 +/- 75.7; CRP2 = 209.1 +/- 67.0, while in 33 repeated samples of the 33 patients in the second group who received adequate treatment the following results were recorded: CRP0 = 124.0 +/- 78.1; CRP1 = 133.8 +/- 63.5; CRP2 = 94.6 +/- 46.4. Increase in serum CRP concentration in the first group during the first 48 hours of initial non-adequate therapy was significantly higher (p = 0.015, two way ANOVA) than in the second group with appropriate treatment. During the first 24 hours of treatment increase in serum concentration of CRP was registered in 12 (85.7%) of 14 measurements in patients with non-adequate therapy and in 19 (56.7%) of 33 measurements in patients with adequate therapy. In the first group during the second day of treatment, in 11 (78.6%) of 14 cases an increase in serum CRP concentration was recorded while in 3 (14.3%) cases CRP concentration decreased. In 31 (91.2%) of 34 measurements in patients with adequate treatment CRP concentration decreased during the second day of treatment and in only 3 (8.8%) cases CRP concentration increased. With an increase in serum concentration of CRP more than 10 mg/L in the second day of antibiotic treatment, probability of non-adequate antibiotic therapy (positive predictive value) was estimated to be 77.0%. Any recorded decrease of serum CRP concentration may confirm appropriate choice of antibiotics during the second day of treatment with probability of 93.3% (negative predictive value). DISCUSSION: Measurement of serum CRP concentration is useful for diagnosis of severe neonatal sepsis. In our study all isolated bacterial strains were comparable in their ability to activate systemic inflammatory response and CRP production. It is known that serial CRP measurements during neonatal sepsis are useful in making decision to cease antibiotic treatment. The highest serum CRP concentrations were detected during the first day of illness but, in some cases even with appropriate treatment, CRP peak levels due to sustained pro-inflammatory action of interleukin-6 production could be detected even 24 hours after treatment was started. Our study showed that in patients with non-adequate initial antibiotic therapy of neonatal sepsis serum CRP concentrations increase further during the second day of treatment. By contrast, the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy in the same time period followed the significant decrease of serum CRP levels in our patients. Therefore, increase of CRP level during initial treatment, especially during the second day of treatment of neonatal sepsis should be taken as indication for replacement of initial antibiotics, even before sensitivity of microbiological causes to given antibiotics is known."
41457009,The Ability of NEWS2 to Detect Sepsis in Adult Patients With Positive Blood Cultures.,2025,"Blood stream infections are associated with high mortality and morbidity. NEWS2 is a quick scoring system including bedside measurable vital signs. This study aimed to investigate the ability of NEWS2 >/= 5p to identify sepsis, per Sepsis-3 criteria, among adult patients with community-acquired infection and positive blood cultures. It also explored if NEWS2 >/= 5p could indicate infection etiology based on bacterial species in blood culture. This retrospective study included 555 patients with positive blood cultures. 425 of 555 (76.6%) patients had sepsis. The sensitivity of NEWS2 >/= 5p for detecting sepsis was 86.6% and was not statistically associated with infection etiology. Patients with S. pneumoniae had a higher median NEWS2 score than those with other bacterial species. The 28-day mortality rate was 12.1%, and the sensitivity of NEWS2 >/= 5p for detecting 28-day mortality was 91.0%. NEWS2 >/= 5p was detected in a high proportion of sepsis cases among patients with blood stream infections, independent of bacterial species, and is a quick tool for identifying high sepsis likelihood in the emergency department."
31837132,Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of Listeria monocytogenes Infection.,2019,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium which can be found in soil or water. Infection with the organism can develop after ingestion of contaminated food products. Small and large outbreaks of listeriosis have been described. Listeria monocytogenes can cause a number of clinical syndromes, most frequently sepsis, meningitis, and rhombencephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. The latter syndrome mimics the veterinary infection in ruminants called ""circling disease"". Neonatal infection can occur as a result of maternal chorioamnionitis (""early onset"" sepsis) or through passage through a birth canal colonized with Listeria from the gastrointestinal tract. (""late onset"" meningitis). Treatment of listeriosis is usually with a combination of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside but other regimens have been used. The mortality rate is high, reflecting the combination of an immunocompromised host and an often delayed diagnosis."
25614712,Neonatal sepsis and inflammatory mediators.,2014,"Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The routinely used laboratory tests are not effective methods of analysis, as they are extremely nonspecific and often cause inappropriate use of antibiotics. Sepsis is the result of an infection associated with a systemic inflammatory response with production and release of a wide range of inflammatory mediators. Cytokines are potent inflammatory mediators and their serum levels are increased during infections, so changes from other inflammatory effector molecules may occur. Although proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been identified as probable markers of neonatal infection, in order to characterize the inflammatory response during sepsis, it is necessary to analyze a panel of cytokines and not only the measurement of individual cytokines. Measurements of inflammatory mediators bring new options for diagnosing and following up neonatal sepsis, thus enabling early treatment and, as a result, increased neonatal survival. By taking into account the magnitude of neonatal sepsis, the aim of this review is to address the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of neonatal sepsis and its value as a diagnostic criterion."
31818709,Application of regression model combined with computer technology in the construction of early warning model of sepsis infection in children.,2020,"This paper uses computer technology combined with regression model to analyze the risk factors of children with sepsis, determine the relevant factors and establish a corresponding early warning model of sepsis, and then verify the clinical application value of the regression model. The paper collected severe infections and sepsis in children who came to our hospital from 2014 to 2018, including 129 patients with infection and 86 patients with sepsis. The general conditions, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and other factors were used. Analysis, to identify the risk of infection development into sepsis, and use Logistic regression model combined with computer technology to construct an early warning model of sepsis. The experimental results show that early warning of sepsis is closely related to skin spots, platelets, procalcitonin, creatinine and international normalized ratio. The experiment demonstrates that the early warning model has higher sensitivity and specificity, and has higher accuracy for predicting whether infection develops into sepsis in advance, and has certain clinical value."

It is caused by gram negative, strictly aerobic bacteria belonging to the order Spirochaetales and to the family Leptospira whose transmission usually occurs through contact with water sources contaminated with animal urine (carriers). Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of leptospirosis; it is associated with high mortality rates. We report the case of a 66-year old patient in whom the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made after a rare complication of pancreatitis. Our patient was admitted with septic shock requiring hemodynamic and respiratory support with renal dialysis. The outcome was favorable."
41503298,Septic Myocarditis Masquerading as Acute Inferior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,2025,"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a rare and alarming presentation in adolescents, particularly in women. We report the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with classic symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, including severe retrosternal chest pain, ST-segment elevations on ECG, and a significantly elevated troponin I level (18 ng/mL). The ECG showed evidence of ST elevation in inferior leads, suggestive of inferior STEMI. Urgent coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, effectively ruling out coronary occlusion. The diagnostic pivot was guided by concomitant fever, hypotension, profound leukocytosis (40,900/microL), and a markedly elevated procalcitonin level (11.1 ng/mL). Blood cultures were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe global left ventricular dysfunction (35%). Despite negative blood cultures, a diagnosis of septic shock with secondary septic myocarditis was made based on the overwhelming clinical and biomarker evidence. Initiation of antibiotic therapy led to rapid clinical improvement within 72 hours, accompanied by complete resolution of ST-segment elevations. This case underscores septic myocarditis as a critical mimic of STEMI and highlights the importance of a normal angiogram in redirecting management toward life-threatening infectious etiologies."
41521406,Consensus guidelines for initial management of neutropenic fever.,2025,"This update of the Australasian consensus guidelines for the initial empiric management of neutropenic fever occurs in the context of major changes in cancer treatment paradigms, as well as advances in the management of sepsis and new models of care for infections since the last version of these guidelines in 2011. Acknowledging the important role of antimicrobials in the disruption of the gut microbiome and emerging antimicrobial resistance, as well as the changing epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance more broadly, these guidelines address current evidence for optimal empiric neutropenic fever therapy. A writing group - including adult and paediatric representatives across infectious diseases, microbiology, haematology, transplant and oncology, as well as across craft groups, including medicine, nursing and pharmacy - was developed to produce and address key management questions. This was overseen by a steering committee, which included consumer representation. Using an extensive review of the literature, these guidelines provide consensus recommendations with evidence grading for initial empiric management of neutropenic fever in adults and children, including recommended investigations, antimicrobial therapy and approach to patients with beta-lactam allergy or risk factors for multidrug-resistant infection. Management beyond the first 72 h is discussed in separate chapters of this issue: the Subsequent Management (for high-risk neutropenic fever) and Ambulatory Management (for low-risk neutropenic fever) chapters."

Recently, It has been known that HMGB1 is released from monocyte/macrophage, neurons, and endothelial cells, and that HMGB1 is involved in sepsis, brain infarction, etc. We have reported that HMGB1 concentrations were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS) and that the elevation was significant in CSF from NMO patients. Moreover, we have also reported that experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (35-55) showed decrease of clinical and pathological severity by treatment with monoclonal anti-HMGB1 antibody. Thus, we think that HMGB1 is associated with pathophysiology in central nervous system in NMO and MS (especially in NMO), and that HMGB1 can be a target molecule for NMO and MS."
25499512,Effect of the treatment with Achyrocline satureioides (free and nanocapsules essential oil) and diminazene aceturate on hematological and biochemical parameters in rats infected by Trypanosoma evansi.,2015,"This study aimed to verify the effect of the treatment with A. satureioides essential oil (free and nanoencapsulated forms) and diminazene aceturate on hematological and biochemical variables in rats infected by Trypanosoma evansi. The 56 rats were divided into seven groups with eight rats each. Groups A, C and D were composed by uninfected animals, and groups B, E, F and G were formed by infected rats with T. evansi. Rats from groups A and B were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Rats from the groups C and E were treated with A. satureioides essential oil, and groups D and F were treated with A. satureioides nanoencapsulated essential oil. Groups C, D, E and F received one dose of oil (1.5 mL kg(-1)) during five consecutive days orally. Group G was treated with diminazene aceturate (D.A.) in therapeutic dose (3.5 mg kg(-1)) in an only dose. The blood samples were collected on day 5 PI for analyses of hematological (erythrocytes and leukocytes count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) and biochemical (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, urea and creatinine) variables. A. satureioides administered was able to maintain low parasitemia, mainly the nanoencapsulated form, on 5 days post infection. On the infected animals with T. evansi treated with A. satureioides essential oil (free and nanocapsules) the number of total leucocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes present was similar to uninfected rats, and different from infected and not-treated animals (leukocytosis). Treatment with A. satureioides in free form elevated levels of ALT and AST, demonstrating liver damage; however, treatment with nanoencapsulated form did not cause elevation of these enzymes. Finally, treatments inhibited the increase in creatinine levels caused by infection for T. evansi. In summary, the nanoencapsulated form showed better activity on the trypanosome; it did not cause liver toxicity and prevented renal damage."
18470713,Procalcitonin (PCT) in patients with abdominal sepsis.,2000,"BACKGROUND: To assess the accuracy of procalcitonin as a measure of severity in patients with septic abdominal illnesses and the sepsis syndrome, to compare measurements with those of other inflammatory mediators, and to predict outcome. METHODS: We carried out a prospective clinical study from 246 patients with infective or septic episodes confirmed at laparotomy and 66 patients undergoing elective operations who acted as controls. Specimens of blood for measurement of cytokine concentrations determination were obtained daily from septic patients. In the control group specimens were obtained before operation, at the end of operation, and on each of the following days until normal recovery (day 10). Every two weeks up to 3 months for patients with metastases, who were being followed up. RESULTS: Compared with other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alphaa and interleukin 6 procalcitonin was closely related to the development of infective and septic complications. 59 of 246 patients (24%) with sepsis died. Procalcitonin concentrations preoperatively [median 2.05 compared with 4.2 ng/ml (p=0.08)] (Mann-Whitney U-test) did not differ, but those on the days 1,4 and at the end differed significantly [day 1: 4.9 compared with 13.8 ng/ml (p<0.01); day 4: 4.8 compared with 13.0 ng/ml (p<0.01) and 0.4 compared with 13.25 ng/ml (p<0.01) at the end of the study]. In the control group only 7 (1.6%) of all blood samples, were detected outside the normal range (up to 0.8 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin is a new indicator of infection and sepsis. TNF and IL-6 concentrations always rise after major operations and fall in the absence of infection, indicating operative trauma. Procalcitonin is sensitive in detecting infective complications. Under routine conditions the procalcitonin concentrations seems to be valid, reproducible and detectable."
33619578,Preventing early-onset group B streptococcal sepsis: clinical risk factor-based screening or culture-based screening?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Two strategies are available for prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis - clinical risk factor-based screening and routine culture-based screening of pregnant women for GBS colonisation. In our hospital, we switched from the former to the latter approach in 2014. METHODS: We compared the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis during 2001-2015 between infants born to pregnant women who were screened for GBS colonisation and those born to women who were not screened. RESULTS: Among 41,143 live births, there were nine cases of early-onset GBS sepsis. All infants with GBS sepsis were born to pregnant women who were not screened for GBS colonisation. The incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis among infants of women who were not screened was 0.41 per 1,000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.77) when compared to infants of women who were screened, for whom the sepsis incidence was zero per 1,000 live births (95% CI 0-0.19; p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that routine culture-based screening of pregnant women for GBS colonisation is a better preventive strategy for early-onset GBS sepsis in neonates when compared to clinical risk factor-based screening."
41462865,Quantification of the Actin-Binding Protein Flightless-I in Human Serum by Automated Western Blot System and Investigation of Its Diagnostic Potential in Sepsis.,2025,"Background: The actin-binding protein Flightless-I (Flii) has not been quantified in the human serum yet. We aimed to determine serum Flii levels in healthy individuals and to investigate Flii as a potential marker in patients with sepsis focusing on diagnosis, organ failures, and short-term mortality. Methods: A total of 30 controls and 64 septic and 22 non-septic patients were enrolled in this follow-up study. Serum Flii levels were quantified by using the capillary electrophoresis-based Simple Western system with chemiluminescent detection. The assay was calibrated by applying dilution series of a purified recombinant human Flii standard and a parallel internal standard. Results: Flii levels of healthy controls were found between 3.5 and 8.8 mg/L, while septic and non-septic patients showed significantly lower values (p < 0.001). First-day Flii could differentiate sepsis from the non-septic inflammatory state (AUC: 0.667; p < 0.05) and indicated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among septic patients (AUC: 0.686; p < 0.05). Furthermore, a combination of Flii and other sepsis markers seemed to offer an improved diagnostic performance (sepsis vs. non-sepsis, AUC of Flii + gelsolin (GSN) + Gc-globulin + procalcitonin: 0.974; p < 0.001 and ARDS vs. non-ARDS, AUC of Flii + GSN + presepsin: 0.776; p < 0.001) compared with single markers even in the prediction of 14-day mortality (AUC of Flii + GSN + Gc-globulin: 0.76; p < 0.001). Conclusions: We adapted a properly precise and reproducible automated Western blot method to determine concentrations of Flii in human serum. Our results revealed the relationship between Flii and sepsis; however, Flii alone did not appear to be a prominent sepsis marker. When combined with other biomarkers, measurement of serum Flightless-I may provide additional value supporting patient care."
15646662,Second transplantation from HLA 2-loci-mismatched mother for graft failure due to hemophagocytic syndrome after cord blood transplantation.,2004,"A 7-year-old girl with acute myelogenous leukemia with multilineage dysplasia received unrelated cord blood transplantation but developed hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) after sepsis with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci before engraftment. Bone marrow aspiration on day 20 revealed a markedly increased number of activated macrophages showing hemophagocytosis. The presence of donor-type chimera in the bone marrow was confirmed at that time. We therefore quickly started immunosuppressive and antibacterial treatment. Although her condition gradually improved, the patient suffered graft failure due to HPS. She received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her HLA 2-loci-mismatched mother on day 54 and continued in complete remission 12 months after the second transplantation. The results in this case suggested that because of fetomaternal microchimerism it may be useful to select an HLA-haploidentical mother as a backup donor for stem cell transplantation."
41541878,Comparison of admitting neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio with baseline NIH stroke scale score in discriminating poor 30-day stroke outcome among Nigerian Africans.,2025,"AIM: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is an established marker of stroke severity. Its use is time-consuming and requires formal training for optimal results. In contrast, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), known to be independently associated with stroke outcome, can be readily calculated from routine peripheral blood counts with minimal training. We hypothesized that the NLR may perform similarly to the NIHSS score, in discriminating persons with poor 30-day stroke outcome, in a low-resource setting. METHODS: We followed up 106 participants with clinico-radiologic diagnosis of first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients with clinico-laboratory features of fever, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, or infection were excluded at baseline. The NLR was obtained at admission while the functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at day 30. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and Cox proportional hazards were used to determine the discriminatory ability of the NLR compared with the NIHSS score in identifying patients with poor 30-day stroke outcome (mRS > 3). The respective areas under the curves (AUC) and HRs (95%CI) were documented. RESULTS: The median interquartile range (IQR) NLR of the study population was 2.87 (3.0). Patients in the higher tertiles of NLR had higher mean standard deviation 30-day mRS scores of 4.9 (1.2) compared to the middle 3.3 (1.2) and lower tertiles 2.3 (1.2) (p < 0.001). Admitting NLR had an AUC (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.75-0.91) and HR (95%CI) of 1.19 (1.01-1.40) compared to admitting NIHSS score with AUC of 0.89 (0.84-0.95) and HR of 1.25 (1.14-1.37) in discriminating poor 30-day outcome. CONCLUSION: The NLR alone performed similarly to the NIHSS score and may help identify patients with adverse 30-day AIS outcome in low-resource settings."
15630654,Thoracodorsal artery perforator (TAP) flap reconstruction of a soft-tissue defect of the knee following below-knee amputation.,2004,"Soft-tissue coverage of lower extremity defects with thin, sensate, mobile, and durable soft tissue is challenging. Reconstructive options are further limited in the setting of a below-knee amputation. The authors present the first report of an innervated thoracodorsal artery perforator (TAP) flap for coverage of an anterior knee soft-tissue defect in a patient with bilateral below-knee amputations following disseminated meningococcemia. The soft-tissue defect measured 11 x 17 cm2 centered over the patella, and the TAP flap provided adequate pedicle length, with optimal soft-tissue thickness and pliability with the potential for innervation and minimal donor-site morbidity. Six months postoperatively, the patient is ambulating well with prostheses fitted over her well-healed, stable, knee coverage."
19997677,Septic polyarthritis caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in a dog.,2010,"A 14-month-old, male German Shepherd dog was admitted with a six-week history of lameness and swelling of the right hindlimb. Clinical examination revealed polyarthritis, fever, petechiae and ecchymoses of the abdominal skin and prepuce. The haematology and blood chemistry were indicative of sepsis. Mediolateral radiographic views of both of the stifle joints revealed signs of bilateral articular capsule swelling. The radiographical, bacteriological and necropsy findings confirmed a diagnosis of septic polyarthritis due to infection with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae."
25531978,Continuous hemodiafiltration with a cytokine-adsorbing hemofilter in patients with septic shock: a preliminary report.,2014,"BACKGROUND/AIM: We investigated the clinical efficacy of continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) with AN69ST hemofilter (AN69ST-CHDF) in patients with septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, single-arm study was conducted. Patients with sepsis and shock defined by hyperlactemia were enrolled. The patients were treated with CHDF and in accordance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (SSCG). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. On ICU admission, the mean blood IL-6 level was 44,800 +/- 77,700 pg/ml, and the mean blood lactate level was 69.0 +/- 49.4 mg/dl. Both the mean blood IL-6 and lactate levels had significantly decreased to normal ranges after 72 h of AN69ST-CHDF. Though the mean APACHE II score was 32.7 +/- 9.8, 28-day survival was 73.5%. CONCLUSION: The current study suggested that adding AN69ST-CHDF to the treatments outlined in the SSCG might lead to good outcomes for patients with septic shock, probably via the removal of cytokines from the bloodstream."
41466902,Klebsiella aerogenes Causing Mitral Valve Infective Endocarditis With Multiple Septic Emboli to the Brain: A Case Report.,2025,"Klebsiella aerogenes is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, it can occasionally cause bloodstream infections and, rarely, infective endocarditis (IE). Severe complications related to K. aerogenes bloodstream infections, such as systemic embolization, have been described in the literature. In this report, we describe a case of K. aerogenes IE in an elderly male patient who initially presented to urgent care with a UTI. He had been diagnosed and prescribed a course of oral antibiotics; however, the treatment failed due to antimicrobial resistance. This led to the development of bacteremia and sepsis requiring hospital admission. He later developed endocarditis as confirmed by echocardiography, which was complicated by mitral regurgitation, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic central nervous system (CNS) strokes. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and assessed by cardiac surgery, though operative management was deferred until his overall condition improved. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely management of IE in patients with persistent Klebsiella bacteremia unresponsive to initial therapy, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach to achieve optimal outcomes, especially when dealing with such rare causative organisms."
25523318,Staphylococcus saprophyticus bacteremia after ESWL in an immunocompetent woman.,2015,"Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a well-known cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, especially in young and sexually active women. Presence in blood cultures is rare and often attributed to contamination. When bacteremia is significant, it occurs mostly in patients with hematologic malignancies and is predominantly catheter-related. However, we describe a case of significant bacteremia with S. saprophyticus associated with urinary tract infection after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of an ureterolithiasis in an otherwise healthy patient."
20102099,Multiple recurrence of hydatid disease lasted 19 years.,2009,"Hydatid disease (echinococcosis) is a potentially fatal parasitosis caused by tapeworm larvae of the genus Echinococcus which affects primarily the liver and the lungs. However, despite effective medical and surgical treatment, risk of recurrence remains the main problem in the treatment of the disease. We describe here a rare case of multiple recurrence of hydatid disease that lasted more than 19 years. The patient presented with multiple cysts of the liver and dissemination to the lung. The way of dissemination remained unclear and speculative. Despite surgical and intensive medical treatment the disease progressed and the patient died in septic shock."
16293007,"Dermagraft, a bioengineered human dermal equivalent for the treatment of chronic nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer.",2004,"Chronic nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers are a common medical problem that may precede severe complications such as infection, sepsis and limb loss. Current standard methods of treatment are aimed at removing necrotic debris, controlling infection, and relieving chronic pressure on the wound. Unfortunately, healing rates are poor with standard treatment, averaging 12-20 weeks in clinical trials. A new strategy for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers has been developed through tissue engineering, allowing the application of healthy living skin cells to assist in the healing process. It is hoped that the living tissue will release appropriate quantities of growth factors, cytokines and other proteins to stimulate the chronic wound bed and accelerate healing. Dermagraft (Smith & Nephew) is a neonatal-derived bioengineered tissue comprised of dermal fibroblasts. In this article, the structure and behavior of this tissue will be examined, focusing particularly on the randomized clinical trials performed to justify its use in diabetic foot ulcers."
41509090,Infection rates of trans-perineal versus trans-rectal prostate biopsy: A Middle Eastern tertiary center experience-Time for a change?,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in men, with transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy being the most frequently used method of tissue diagnosis in the past. With the introduction of the new modality of trans-perineal (TP) ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, urologists and radiologists adopted this new technique for the decreased rate of complications such as urinary tract infections, bacteremia, sepsis and the avoidance of antimicrobial prophylaxis. We aim to compare the infectious rates of TRUS versus TP biopsy from our Middle Eastern tertiary care center. METHODS: Retrospective data was collected on patients from our medical records from May 2019 till December 2023 at our institution. The data included adult male patients aged 18 years and above undergoing TP or TRUS prostate biopsy. Patients with positive urine culture before biopsy were excluded. Electronic medical records, pathology and laboratory reports were reviewed to collect patient-related data including age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, medical history and comorbidities. In addition, variables related to the procedure type, the target lesion location, antibiotic prophylaxis, bowl preparation, number of cores taken, and laterality of the tumor were included. RESULTS: A total of 745 patients underwent an ultrasound guided prostate biopsy performed by 6 attending urologists at our institution. Among them, 157 (21.1%) patients underwent TRUS biopsy, while 588 (78.9%) underwent TP biopsy. Within one month of the biopsy, 13 patients (1.7%) developed UTI. 6 of them had TRUS (4.1%), and 7 had TP (1.2%) with p = 0.03. Four patients required hospital admission for fever and bacteremia, all of which had undergone TRUS biopsy with hospital stay from 2-5 days receiving meropenem, ciprofloxacin, cefixime or Bactrim. CONCLUSION: TP prostate biopsy carries a lower risk of infectious complications and requires no antibiotic prophylaxis compared to TRUS biopsy of the prostate. These results advocate the superiority of the use of TP biopsy over TRUS biopsy."
25510301,"Incidence, characteristics and outcome of ICU-acquired candidemia in India.",2015,"PURPOSE: A systematic epidemiological study on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired candidemia across India. METHOD: A prospective, nationwide, multicentric, observational study was conducted at 27 Indian ICUs. Consecutive patients who acquired candidemia after ICU admission were enrolled during April 2011 through September 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables of these patients were recorded. The present study is an analysis of data specific for adult patients. RESULTS: Among 1,400 ICU-acquired candidemia cases (overall incidence of 6.51 cases/1,000 ICU admission), 65.2 % were adult. Though the study confirmed the already known risk factors for candidemia, the acquisition occurred early after admission to ICU (median 8 days; interquartile range 4-15 days), even infecting patients with lower APACHE II score at admission (median 17.0; mean +/- SD 17.2 +/- 5.9; interquartile range 14-20). The important finding of the study was the vast spectrum of agents (31 Candida species) causing candidemia and a high rate of isolation of Candida tropicalis (41.6 %). Azole and multidrug resistance were seen in 11.8 and 1.9 % of isolates. Public sector hospitals reported a significantly higher presence of the relatively resistant C. auris (8.2 vs. 3.9 %; p = 0.008) and C. rugosa (5.6 vs. 1.5 %; p = 0.001). The 30-day crude and attributable mortality rates of candidemia patients were 44.7 and 19.6 %, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant independent predictors of mortality including admission to public sector hospital, APACHE II score at admission, underlying renal failure, central venous catheterization and steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted a high burden of candidemia in Indian ICUs, early onset after ICU admission, higher risk despite less severe physiology score at admission and a vast spectrum of agents causing the disease with predominance of C. tropicalis."
20013257,Pharmacokinetics of linezolid in septic patients with and without extended dialysis.,2010,"PURPOSE: Linezolid is an option for the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria. The survival of critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF) can be improved by increasing the dose of renal replacement therapy. Extended (daily) dialysis (ED) is a new and important approach to renal replacement therapy in intensive care units. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linezolid in septic patients without ED and on ED, respectively. METHODS: We studied the pharmacokinetics of linezolid in adult intensive care patients with sepsis (n = 5) and anuric septic patients with ARF being treated with ED (n = 10). Linezolid 600 mg was administered intravenously twice daily. The pharmacokinetic parameters, their variability, and possible covariates were analyzed using NONMEM. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of linezolid followed a two-compartment model with clearance (Cl) = 0.159 L h(-1) kg(-1) +/- 51% (population mean +/- interindividual variability), central volume of distribution (V(1)) = 0.273 L/kg +/- 21%, intercompartmental clearance (Q) = 0.369 L h(-1) kg(-1), and peripheral volume of distribution (V(2)) = 0.271 L/kg. The clearance in ED patients while on dialysis was increased by 3.5 L/h, and patients with liver transplantation/resection had their clearance reduced by 60%. Intra-individual variability was much smaller than inter-individual variability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that linezolid pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with ARF undergoing ED is not comparable to that in healthy subjects and patients without ARF. The best method of managing linezolid dosage in such a complex group of patients, whose physiology can vary daily, would be to use therapeutic drug monitoring."
41408558,Predicting mortality in critically ill patients: a machine learning approach to electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors.,2025,"The study aimed to enhance ICU mortality prediction by integrating electrolyte imbalances and clinical risk factors using machine learning, addressing gaps in traditional severity scores like SOFA and APACHE II. Dominant Predictors of Mortality: SOFA score >/= 8 (aOR = 4.0), mechanical ventilation (aOR = 3.1), hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L; aOR = 2.6), vasopressor use (aOR = 2.7), and GCS </= 8 (aOR = 2.4). High-Risk Phenotypes: ""Triad of Death"" (SOFA >/= 8 + mechanical ventilation + vasopressors), metabolic crisis (lactate > 4 mmol/L + pH < 7.2), and frail elderly (age >/= 65 with comorbidities). The XGBoost model achieved superior discrimination (AUC-ROC = 0.86) compared to logistic regression (AUC = 0.84), SOFA (AUC = 0.72), and APACHE II (AUC = 0.75). A nomogram was developed to stratify mortality risk into four actionable tiers (e.g., scores > 150 predicted > 60% mortality). The model performed consistently across subgroups (sepsis, age strata, AKI stages), with AUCs > 0.80. Sepsis patients: Lactate and vasopressor use were stronger predictors (38% contribution to SHAP values) Early correction of modifiable factors (e.g., sepsis, acidosis) may improve outcomes. The nomogram offers a practical bedside tool for risk stratification and clinical decision-making."
41500683,[Lactate trajectory-based phenotypes and their association with 28-day mortality in septic cardiomyopathy: a multicenter retrospective cohort study].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate phenotypic classification based on plasma lactate trajectories and its association with 28-day mortality in patients with septic cardiomyopathy (SCM). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with SCM admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three tertiary hospitals (Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, and GuiQian International Hospital) from October 2019 to December 2024 were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, intervention strategies, and clinical outcomes were collected, including the first blood lactate level upon ICU admission and daily lactate values within 7 days after SCM diagnosis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included 28-day vasoactive drug-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. Latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to identify lactate trajectory-based phenotypes. Differences in the above indicators among phenotypes were compared, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in SCM patients. RESULTS: A total of 216 SCM patients were included, among whom 41 died and 175 survived within 28 days. LCGM identified four lactate trajectory phenotypes: phenotype 1 (persistent low level, n = 142), phenotype 2 (moderate level with rapid decline, n = 32), phenotype 3 (moderate level with slow increase, n = 20), and phenotype 4 (high level with slow decline, n = 22). The 28-day mortality rates of patients in phenotypes 1-4 showed a significant increasing trend (9.2%, 21.9%, 30.0%, and 68.2%, respectively, P < 0.05). Phenotype 1, which exhibited the lowest mortality and lowest acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE), was designated as the baseline group. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that phenotypes 3 and 4 were associated with 28-day mortality in SCM patients (both P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that phenotype 3 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.831, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.243-6.447] and phenotype 4 (HR = 2.389, 95%CI was 1.223-4.663) were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality (both P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the survival probability gradually flattened after 3 weeks of hospitalization. Using phenotype 1 as the baseline, patients with phenotypes 3 and 4 had a higher risk of death, and the risk in phenotype 4 was significantly higher than that in phenotype 3 (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the four patient groups were stratified into high-risk (high level with slow decline), intermediate-risk (moderate level with slow increase), and low-risk (moderate level with rapid decline and persistent low level) categories. CONCLUSIONS: Four phenotypes of SCM were successfully identified based on lactate trajectories, which were closely associated with 28-day mortality and could be used for risk stratification, providing new insights for prognosis assessment and individualized treatment of SCM."
31946509,State Analysis of Total Stressed Blood Volume and Arterial Elastance During Induced Sepsis.,2019,"Sepsis can cause major complications in the cardiovascular system. Accurate monitoring of model-based bio-markers, such as total stressed blood volume, SBV(T) , have been shown to be important parameters in determining the effectiveness of fluid therapy in sepsis patients. Another such parameter is arterial elastance, E(a), which is a measure of the relative stiffness of arteries. This work investigates the effect of fluid therapy and induced sepsis on these parameters through a state average analysis and comparison to previously defined clinical references. A three chambered lumped cardiovascular system model was implemented to develop model based analogues of the two parameters in six porcine subjects. A mean state average increase of 20.9% in SBV(T) was found in response to fluid therapy, while a mean state average decrease of 32.7% occurred, in surviving subjects, after sepsis was induced. E(a) showed a mean state average drop of 12.2% during fluid therapy and an increase of 45% after sepsis is induced. Both results match hypothesised expectations."
41462112,Monitoring immune cell dynamics for potential prognostic biomarker of sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host immune responses. This study investigates dynamic changes in immune cells during sepsis progression and evaluates their utility as predictive biomarkers for sepsis prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, immune cells from 220 patients with sepsis were compared with those of 70 healthy controls. Patients with sepsis were stratified by 28-day outcome into survivors (n = 148) and non-survivors (n = 72). Immune cells included the counts and percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes; the percentages of CD3(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were also calculated. Immune parameters were monitored on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after sepsis diagnosis to characterize dynamic trajectories. RESULTS: The count and percentage of neutrophils, the count of monocytes, NLR, MLR and CRP in patients with sepsis were significantly increased, while the count and percentage of lymphocytes, the percentage of monocytes, the percentages of CD3(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells were lower as compared to the control. The NLR demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy for sepsis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.981 (95% CI: 0.965 ~ 0.998). The percentage of neutrophils achieved an AUC of 0.980 (95% CI: 0.958 ~ 1.000). The percentage of neutrophils and NLR performed comparably to CRP and outperformed other immune cell indices. The count of monocytes on day 7, the percentage of monocytes on day 7 and 21, the count of lymphocytes on day 7 and 14, the percentage of lymphocytes on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were lower than those in the survival group. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR on day 7, 14 and 21 in the non-survival group were higher than that in the survival group. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes in the survivors of sepsis trend upward over time. The percentage of neutrophils and NLR show potential as a prognostic biomarker for sepsis and may be useful to predict 28-day hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Day 7 may represent a critical window for prognostic assessment in sepsis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-12048-1."
15646078,Temporal change in the use of genotypic resistance testing over the years 1999--2003.,2004,"The evaluation of resistance test perception by clinicians over the years 1999--2003 was assessed in an Italian cohort. The results on 2233 samples from 1416 HIV-1 infected patients show an increase in HIV-1 drug resistance test requests over time, with a plateau reached in the last three years. CD4-cell count at the time of genotype request progressively increased. In particular, the median CD4 cell count of drug-treated patients increased from 221x10(6) cells/l [interquartile range (IQR): 109-368] in 1999 to 296x10(6) cells/l (IQR: 166-478) in 2003 (p<0.0001). At the same time, plasma HIV-RNA level progressively decreased from a median of 103,500 copies/ml (IQR: 37,250-260,000) in 1999 to 9,444 copies/ml (IQR: 2,086-41,281) in 2003 (p<0.0001). Overall, data suggest that the genotype test is increasingly considered, and requested also for patients at earlier stages of drug history and/or at less severe disease stage."
19936055,"Major depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in HIV-2 infection, an attenuated form of HIV disease.",2009,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) provide an important link between innate and acquired immunity, mediating their action mainly through IFN-alpha production. pDC suppress HIV-1 replication, but there is increasing evidence suggesting they may also contribute to the increased levels of cell apoptosis and pan-immune activation associated with disease progression. Although having the same clinical spectrum, HIV-2 infection is characterized by a strikingly lower viremia and a much slower rate of CD4 decline and AIDS progression than HIV-1, irrespective of disease stage. We report here a similar marked reduction in circulating pDC levels in untreated HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in association with CD4 depletion and T cell activation, in spite of the undetectable viremia found in the majority of HIV-2 patients. Moreover, the same overexpression of CD86 and PD-L1 on circulating pDC was found in both infections irrespective of disease stage or viremia status. Our observation that pDC depletion occurs in HIV-2 infected patients with undetectable viremia indicates that mechanisms other than direct viral infection determine the pDC depletion during persistent infections. However, viremia was associated with an impairment of IFN-alpha production on a per pDC basis upon TLR9 stimulation. These data support the possibility that diminished function in vitro may relate to prior activation by HIV virions in vivo, in agreement with our finding of higher expression levels of the IFN-alpha inducible gene, MxA, in HIV-1 than in HIV-2 individuals. Importantly, serum IFN-alpha levels were not elevated in HIV-2 infected individuals. In conclusion, our data in this unique natural model of ""attenuated"" HIV immunodeficiency contribute to the understanding of pDC biology in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, showing that in the absence of detectable viremia a major depletion of circulating pDC in association with a relatively preserved IFN-alpha production does occur."
19949758,Fusobacterium bacteremia: clinical significance and outcomes.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fusobacterium bacteremia is uncommon, accounting for approximately 0.9% of patients with bacteremia. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of blood cultures positive for Fusobacterium spp., risk factors for mortality, and the impact of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a 5-year retrospective study in which the medical records of patients with Fusobacterium bacteremia treated at the Division of Infectious Diseases, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, from 2002 to 2006 were analyzed. RESULTS: Fusobacterium spp. accounted for 0.74% of 16,676 positive blood cultures. 123 patients were included in the study, 53 of whom had polymicrobial bacteremia (43.1%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most common species identified (41.5%). The mean age +/- standard deviation of the patients was 62.6 +/- 18.9 years. The most common sources of bacteremia were the gastrointestinal tract, lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue. Thirty four patients (27.6%) had no definite loci of infection. The overall mortality rate was 40.7% (50 patients), which was not associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy (p = 0.950), Fusobacterium spp., source of infection, or polymicrobial bacteremia. Shock, lack of fever at presentation, and underlying diseases (heart failure, renal insufficiency, or malignancy) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Fusobacterium bacteremia was associated with a high mortality rate for patients with renal insufficiency, heart failure, or malignancy. Delayed start of appropriate antimicrobial therapy did not impact the outcomes."
20034324,[Real-time PCR in rapid diagnosis of Aeromonas hydrophila necrotizing soft tissue infections].,2009,"We report a case of rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection and sepsis followed by a patient's death. We suspected Vibrio vulnificus infection because the patient's underlying disease was cirrhosis and the course extremely rapid. No microbe had been detected at death. We extracted DNA from a blood culture bottle. SYBR green I real-time PCR was conducted but could not detect V. vulnificus vvh in the DNA sample. Aeromonas hydrophila was cultured and identified in blood and necrotized tissue samples. Real-time PCR was conducted to detect A. hydrophila ahh1, AHCYTOEN and aerA in the DNA sample extracted from the blood culture bottle and an isolated necrotized tissue strain, but only ahh1 was positive. High-mortality in necrotizing soft tissue infections makes it is crucial to quickly detect V. vulnificus and A. hydrophila. We found real-time PCR for vvh, ahh1, AHCYTOEN, and aerA useful in detecting V. vulnificus and A. hydrophila in necrotizing soft tissue infections."
20101278,The inflammatory response to miniaturised extracorporeal circulation: a review of the literature.,2009,"Conventional cardiopulmonary bypass can trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome similar to sepsis. Aetiological factors include surgical trauma, reperfusion injury, and, most importantly, contact of the blood with the synthetic surfaces of the heart-lung machine. Recently, a new cardiopulmonary bypass system, mini-extracorporeal circulation (MECC), has been developed and has shown promising early results in terms of reducing this inflammatory response. It has no venous reservoir, a reduced priming volume, and less blood-synthetic interface. This review focuses on the inflammatory and clinical outcomes of using MECC and compares these to conventional cardio-pulmonary bypass (CCPB). MECC has been shown to reduce postoperative cytokines levels and other markers of inflammation. In addition, MECC reduces organ damage, postoperative complications and the need for blood transfusion. MECC is a safe and viable perfusion option and in certain circumstances it is superior to CCPB."
25514404,Should central venous catheter be systematically removed in patients with suspected catheter related infection?,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Best clinical practice for patients with suspected catheter-related infection (CRI) remains unclear according to the latest Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze clinical practice concerning the central venous catheter (CVC) and its impact on prognosis in patients with suspected CRI. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study in 18 Spanish Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Inclusion criteria were patients with CVC and suspected CRI. The following exclusion criteria were used: age less than 18 years; pregnancy; lactation; human immunodeficiency virus; neutropenia; solid or haematological tumor; immunosuppressive or radiation therapy; transplanted organ; intravascular foreign body; haemodynamic instability; suppuration or frank erythema/induration at the insertion site of the CVC, and patients with bacteremia or fungemia. The end-point of the study was mortality at 30 days of CRI suspicion. RESULTS: The study included 384 patients. In 214 (55.8%) patients, CVC was removed at the moment of CRI suspicion, in 114 (29.7%) CVC was removed later and in 56 (14.6%) CVC was not removed. We did not find significant differences between survivors (n =311) and non-survivors (n =73) at 30 days according to CVC decision (P =0.26). The rate of confirmed catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was higher in survivors than in non-survivors (14.5% versus 4.1%; P =0.02). Mortality rate was lower in patients with CRBSI than in the group of patients whose clinical symptoms were due to other causes (3/48 (6.25%) versus 70/336 (20.8%); P =0.02). We did not find significant differences in mortality in patients with confirmed CRBSI according to CVC removal at the moment of CRI suspicion (n =38) or later (n =10) (7.9% versus 0; P =0.99). CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected CRI, immediate CVC removal may be not necessary in all patients. Other aspects should be taken into account in the decision-making, such as vascular accessibility, the risk of mechanical complications during new cannulation that may be life-threatening, and the possibility that the CVC may not be the origin of the suspected CRI."
32005367,Sepsis Management in the Emergency Department.,2020,"Sepsis is a deadly and costly condition, but effectively managing sepsis in the emergency department (ED) can help to improve patient outcomes. A key part of sepsis management is improving compliance with sepsis bundles, which can be challenging in the ED setting. Bedside nurses in the ED have a unique opportunity to facilitate early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis, which increases sepsis bundle compliance and improves patient outcomes. Interventions reviewed in this article can help to improve early identification and treatment, along with ways to standardize care, provide education, and implement feedback."
25546913,[Acute kidney injury in patients with acute respiratory distress].,2014,"Acute respiratory distress together with hypoxia could be an indication for admission to intensive care unit. It may also lead to acute kidney injury. In addition, mechanical ventilation may be an additional factor for development of acute kidney injury. The aim of the work was to assess the prevalence of acute kidney injury, including the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress treated in intensive care unit. In addition, the effect of acute kidney injury on outcome of patients with acute respiratory distress was evaluated. The studies were performed on 100 patients with acute respiratory distress treated in intensive care unit of the regional hospital. Patients were divided into 2 groups in respect to the presence or absence of acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed in 22% of patients with acute respiratory distress, while 12% required renal replacement therapy, it was more often observed in patients with estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Length of stay was similar irrespective of kidney function, however, the mortality was significantly higher in patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, particularly in those on hemodialyses. In addition, mortality was associated with older age and sepsis."

25534103,[Clinical analyses of 80 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients with Epstein-Barr viremia].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients with Epstein-Barr viremia (EBV). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of 80 HLH patients aged >/= 14 years with EBV-DNA >1 000 copies/ml in peripheral blood from 2008 to 2013. RESULTS: There were EBV-HLH (n = 46), HLH-associated lymphoma (n = 30) and primary HLH (n = 4). Among the relevant laboratory parameters, inter-group statistical differences existed only in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.021, 0.035). The median follow-up period was 2.0 (0.5-20.0) months. And the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates were 58.8%, 37.5%, 29.7% and 19.6% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HLH patients with EBV have a pernicious clinical course with a poor prognosis. And it makes little sense for distinguishing HLH-associated lymphoma from EBV-HLH through routine laboratory tests."
31898562,[Prognostic value of Charlson weighted index of comorbidities combined with sequential organ failure assessment score and procalcitonin in patients with sepsis].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of Charlson weighted index of comorbidities (WIC) combined with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and procalcitonin (PCT) in sepsis patients in intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted. 118 patients with sepsis admitted to ICU of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital from July 2015 to June 2018 were enrolled. The clinical data of the patients including gender, age, pathogenic factors, site of infection, underlying diseases and 28-day prognosis were collected, while the WIC score at ICU admission, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and SOFA score within 24 hours after ICU admission, serum PCT level within 1 hour after ICU admission were recorded. The patients were divided into survival group and death group according to 28-day prognosis, and the clinical data of patients with different prognosis were compared. Multivariate Logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between WIC score, SOFA score, PCT level and the outcomes of patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the value of WIC score, SOFA score, and PCT level for predicting the prognosis of patients with sepsis. RESULTS: In this study, 118 eligible sepsis patients were enrolled, and 94 patients survived at 28 days, and 24 patients died with a 28-day mortality of 20.3%. Compared with the survival group, the patients in the death group were older and had higher APACHE II score, WIC score, SOFA score, and serum PCT levels. Pathogenic factors analysis showed that the proportion of pulmonary infection in the death group was the highest (62.5%), while in the survival group the main cause was multiple injury (36.2%), followed by pulmonary infection (30.9%). Basic diseases analysis showed that the proportions of tumor, type 2 diabetes, chronic lung disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic cardiac insufficiency in the death group were significantly higher than those in the survival group. The age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.279, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.065-1.536], APACHE II score (OR = 1.255, 95%CI was 1.083-1.455), WIC score (OR = 1.429, 95%CI was 1.304-1.568), SOFA score (OR = 1.331, 95%CI was 1.456-1.545), and serum PCT level (OR = 1.497, 95%CI was 1.146-1.547) were related to the 28-day prognosis of patients with sepsis, and were independent predictors of 28-day prognosis in patients with sepsis (all P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of WIC score, SOFA score, serum PCT level and combined prediction probability was 0.712 (95%CI was 0.588-0.836), 0.801 (95%CI was 0.695-0.908), 0.889 (95%CI was 0.798-0.979), 0.943 (95%CI was 0.884-1.000), respectively, indicating that the accuracy of combined parameters to predict survival outcome was higher than that of any single parameter with the sensitivity of 91.7% and the specificity of 83.0%. CONCLUSIONS: WIC score, SOFA score combined with serum PCT level can improve the accuracy of predicting the 28-day prognosis in patients with sepsis."
20187513,Congenital intrinsic intestinal obstruction in a Caribbean country.,2009,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical characteristics, perioperative features, and outcome of congenital intrinsic intestinal obstruction in a developing Caribbean country for comparison with previous literature reports. This study included retrospective data collection on all infants referred to the hospital with a diagnosis of congenital intrinsic bowel obstruction during the period 1999-2006. Data studied were demographic features, perioperative details, surgical procedures performed, postoperative course, and early outcome. Twenty-two infants were treated, with an incidence of 3.14 per 10,000 live births. Duodenal outnumbered jejuno-ileal lesions by 1.5 to 1. Complications occurred in 68.2% of cases, and the mortality rate was 27.3%. Lower gestational age, a high leukocyte count, and more distal small bowel obstruction were significantly associated with mortality. Improvement in the outcome of surgical treatment of this problem in this population requires more effective perioperative management of prematurity and sepsis."

We present an unusual case of epidural abscess with associated discitis in the cervical spine of a 12-year-old after a dental extraction. This potentially dangerous complication was diagnosed before neurological complications developed and was successfully treated with antibiotics alone, preventing the need for surgery. An extensive search of the literature has revealed only 5 cases of epidural abscess secondary to dental sepsis, and to the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case in the pediatric population. We present the case and a brief review of the literature on this subject."
41410575,Validation and Application of a Predictive Score of Acute Chest Syndrome.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease, and acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication with a substantial risk of death. The aim of this study was to validate the previously developed PREdictive SEVerity (PRESEV) score for the occurrence of ACS in adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized for VOC and to assess the safety of outpatient management of patients with a low-risk score. METHODS: To validate the PRESEV score, a prospective observational study was conducted in 13 centers across 5 countries in Africa and Europe. The score ranges from 0 to 16, with values of 5 or less considered low risk. The safety of a low-risk score (</=5) for outpatient management was then assessed in 100 patients. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ACS. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients were included for the validation of the score: 206 (52.4%) from Europe and 187 (47.6%) from Africa. Of these, 76 patients (19.3%) developed ACS. Of the 50 patients (12.7%) with a low-risk score, 3 (6.0%) developed ACS (negative predictive value 94.0%). Of the 76 patients who developed ACS, 73 (96.1%) did not have a low-risk score (sensitivity 96.1%). A total of five deaths (1.3%) was recorded; no individuals who died had a low-risk score. Score performance was similar across both continents. When the score was used to guide outpatient management in 100 patients with VOC, one case of ACS (1.0%) was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This international study validated the PRESEV predictive risk score to identify adult patients at low risk for ACS.

20011508,Inhibition of adaptive immune responses leads to a fatal clinical outcome in SIV-infected pigtailed macaques but not vervet African green monkeys.,2009,"African green monkeys (AGM) and other natural hosts for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) do not develop an AIDS-like disease following SIV infection. To evaluate differences in the role of SIV-specific adaptive immune responses between natural and nonnatural hosts, we used SIV(agmVer90) to infect vervet AGM and pigtailed macaques (PTM). This infection results in robust viral replication in both vervet AGM and pigtailed macaques (PTM) but only induces AIDS in the latter species. We delayed the development of adaptive immune responses through combined administration of anti-CD8 and anti-CD20 lymphocyte-depleting antibodies during primary infection of PTM (n = 4) and AGM (n = 4), and compared these animals to historical controls infected with the same virus. Lymphocyte depletion resulted in a 1-log increase in primary viremia and a 4-log increase in post-acute viremia in PTM. Three of the four PTM had to be euthanized within 6 weeks of inoculation due to massive CMV reactivation and disease. In contrast, all four lymphocyte-depleted AGM remained healthy. The lymphocyte-depleted AGM showed only a trend toward a prolongation in peak viremia but the groups were indistinguishable during chronic infection. These data show that adaptive immune responses are critical for controlling disease progression in pathogenic SIV infection in PTM. However, the maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms including non-adaptive immune mechanisms."

METHODS: The clinical data of 10 patients with SFC treated by laparoscopic surgery combined with TEM between May 2010 and October 2012 in Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine were retrospectively analyzed. The gastrointestinal quality of life index(GIQLI), Wexner constipation scale and daily frequency of defecation postoperatively during follow-up were collected. RESULTS: All the 10 operations were successfully accomplished laparoscopic subtotal colectomy combined with TEM without abdominal incision. There was no conversion to open procedure. One case had preventive terminal ileum stoma. The mean operative time was (256 +/- 58) min. The mean blood loss was (178 +/- 67) ml. The mean time to first flatus was (40 +/- 11) h. There were no ureteric injury, anastomotic leak, pelvic sepsis and other complications postoperatively. There was one case of insufficient small bowel obstruction which was released by conservative treatments. The patients were discharged from the hospital in (9.0 +/- 1.5) d postoperatively. The GIQLI in one year postoperatively was (112 +/- 10) points, which indicated good results compared to (75 +/- 12) points preoperatively (P=0.000). The Wexner constipation scale was 20.8 +/- 2.2 preoperatively and decreased to 5.2 +/- 1.8 at one year follow-up(P=0.000). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy and modified Duhamel procedure combined with TEM provides SFC patients a safe and feasible minimally invasive surgery."
41437592,[Advances in the study of de-resuscitation in septic shock].,2025,"The initial management of septic shock necessitates adequate fluid resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion. However, excessive or sustained fluid administration may precipitate fluid accumulation syndrome (FAS), significantly exacerbating the risk of organ dysfunction and mortality. Consequently, proactive prevention and management of FAS are paramount for optimizing patient outcomes. With the continuous optimization of fluid resuscitation strategies in the treatment of septic shock, de-resuscitation, as a key stage for preventing or correcting FAS, provides an important opportunity to improve patient prognosis. Recent studies have shown that during the later phase of septic shock resuscitation, active de-resuscitation combined with hemodynamic monitoring, adjustment of vasoactive drugs and other comprehensive intervention measures can help reduce fluid positive balance, lower the risk of organ dysfunction, shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and improve patient prognosis. Currently, the timing of de-resuscitation, volume assessment methods, the development of individualized treatment protocols, and the prevention and control of related complications have become the focus of research, while the search for reliable biomarkers to guide de-resuscitation strategies will become a future hot direction. In this article, we review the pathophysiology and clinical diagnosis of FAS, as well as the clinical strategies, controversies and challenges of de-resuscitation in septic shock, and explore the future research directions of de-resuscitation strategies, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and practical guidance for optimizing fluid management in patients with septic shock."
20012334,Six weeks antibiotic therapy for all bone infections: results of a cohort study.,2010,"There is no consensus on the antibiotic therapy for bone infection due to the heterogeneous spectrum of diseases. Most authors suggest different durations of treatment based on pathophysiological considerations. However, adverse effects are related, at least in part, to the duration of treatment. We, therefore, investigated a 6 weeks antibiotic combination therapy for all cases of bone infection. Herewith, we report the results of this therapeutic approach. This is a cohort study including all patients presenting with bone infection, regardless of the mechanism involved. The diagnosis was based on bone biopsy obtained through invasive procedures. Chronic bone infection was defined as a history of disease of over 1 month duration. The duration of clinical follow-up following treatment discontinuation was at least 6 months. Cured bone infection was defined as the absence of relapse after antibiotic discontinuation. One hundred and eighteen patients were included between July 2005 and March 2009; 61 presented with bone infection following prosthetic implant (52%) and the 57 remaining patients had bone infection without foreign material (48%). Surgery was required for 80 patients (68%). Microbial agents were identified in 116/118 patients, with 24 patients presenting with polymicrobial sepsis (20%). The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 42 +/- 0.2 days and the mean clinical follow-up was 27 +/- 14 months. The treatment success rate was 91.5% (108/118). Six weeks of antimicrobial therapy appears to be effective for nearly all bone infections, regardless of the pathophysiology. These results encourage us to pursue attempts to simplify the management of bone infection without obvious prejudice to the patient."
25757350,[Nurse questionnaire survey about the urethral catheterization and clinical analysis of iatrogenic urethral injury].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at determining the status of iatrogenic urethral injury associated with insertion of urethral catheters at our hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied the data of 32 patients with iatrogenic urethral injury at our hospital. We also carried out a questionnaire survey of 150 nurses who could be in charge of urethral catheter insertions, and conducted an analysis based on the answers obtained from 133 of the 150 nurses (response rate 88.7%). RESULTS: The 32 patients included 14 patients with reduced activity of daily living (ADL) who required assistance in daily life (44%), 4 patients with spinal cord injury (13%), and 4 patients under anesthesia or sedation (13%). Acute complications included sepsis in 5 patients (16%) and septic shock in 3 patients (9%). Long-term urethral catheterization was indicated in all the patients with sepsis. Examination of the responses to the questionnaire showed that while 86% of the nurses said ""I inject water to fix the balloon after confirming urine outflow,"" 7% answered ""I inject water into the balloon even if there is no urine outflow""; 46% said ""I compress the lower abdomen when there is no urine outflow,"" 6% said ""I perform urinary bladder irrigation,"" and 48% said ""I neither compress the lower abdomen when there is no urinary flow nor perform urinary bladder irrigation"". CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the patients with iatrogenic urethral injury at our hospital had reduced ADL. In the patients in whom long-term catheterization was indicated, urethral injury at the time of regular replacement of a catheter was associated with a high likelihood of sepsis occurring as a complication. Based on the results of the questionnaire, more than 80% of the nurses complied with the rule that water to fix the balloon must be injected only after confirming urinary outflow at the time of inserting a urethral catheter. However, when there was no urine outflow after insertion of the catheter, there were variations in the procedure to handle the situation. In the education of nurses, training on the appropriate actions that must be taken in this situation appears to be important."
19951387,"Characterization of tissue oxygen saturation and the vascular occlusion test: influence of measurement sites, probe sizes and deflation thresholds.",2009,"INTRODUCTION: Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and the vascular occlusion test (VOT) can identify tissue hypoperfusion in trauma and sepsis. However, the technique is neither standardized nor uses the same monitoring site. We hypothesized that baseline and VOT StO2 would be different in the forearm (F) and thenar eminence (TH) and that different minimal StO2 values during the VOT would result in different reoxygenation rates (ReO2). METHODS: StO2 and its change during the VOT were simultaneously measured in the F and TH, with 15 mm and 25 mm probes, using the 325 InSpectra monitor in 18 healthy, adult volunteers. Two VOTs were done to a threshold thenar StO2 of 40% interchanging the 15 mm and 25 mm probes between sites. Two additional VOTs were done to thresholds of 50% and 30%. Baseline StO2 (BaseO2), the deoxygenation rate (DeO2) and ReO2 were compared between sites, probes and (%O2/minute) thresholds. Results are presented as the median (interquartile range), P-value. RESULTS: BaseO2, DeO2, ReO2, area under the curve and hyperemia duration values were different when comparing TH vs. F and 15 mm vs. 25 mm probes. ReO2 was different between different thresholds for the TH and 15 mm probes. TH15 mm vs. F15 mm: BaseO2, 90.4 (85.2, 93.5) vs. 85.2 (80.7, 90.2), P = 0.031; DO2, -12.1 (-16.2, -11.3) vs. -8.5 (-10.3, -7.8), P = 0.011; ReO2, 297.2 (213.7, 328.6), P < 0.0001; 15 mm vs. 25 mm probe: BaseO2, 97.2 (89.4, 94.7) vs. 87.3 (81.7, 90.9), P = 0.016; DeO2, -18.0 (-24.1, -14.8) vs. -9.9 (-15.3, -6.5), P < 0.0001; and ReO2, 401.6 (331.7, 543.2) vs. 160.5 (132.3, 366.9), P = 0.012, respectively. TH15 mm vs. TH25 mm: BaseO2, P = 0.020; DeO2, P < 0.0001; and ReO2, P < 0.0001. Threshold StO2 values (15 mm probe only): ReO2, P = 0.003; DeO2, P = 0.60. ReO2 at 40% and 50% StO2 thresholds, P = 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: BaseO2, DeO2 and ReO2 were different when measured in different anatomical sites (F and TH) and with different probe sizes, and ReO2 was different with differing VOT release StO2 threshold values. Thus, standardization of the site, probe and VOT challenge need to be stipulated when reporting data."
20003200,Intensive insulin treatment improves forearm blood flow in critically ill patients: a randomized parallel design clinical trial.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Intensive insulin treatment of critically ill patients was seen as a promising method of treatment, though recent studies showed that reducing the blood glucose level below 6 mmol/l had a detrimental outcome. The mechanisms of the effects of insulin in the critically ill are not completely understood. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that intensive insulin treatment may influence forearm blood flow independently of global hemodynamic indicators. METHODS: The study encompassed 29 patients of both sexes who were admitted to the intensive care unit due to sepsis and required artificial ventilation as the result of acute respiratory failure. 14 patients were randomly selected for intensive insulin treatment (Group 1; blood glucose concentration 4.4-6.1 mmol/l), and 15 were selected for conventional insulin treatment (Group 2; blood glucose level 7.0 mmol/l-11.0 mmol/l). At the start of the study (t0, beginning up to 48 hours after admittance and the commencement of artificial ventilation), at 2 hours (t1), 24 hours (t2), and 72 hours (t3) flow in the forearm was measured for 60 minutes using the strain-gauge plethysmography method. Student's t-test of independent samples was used for comparisons between the two groups, and Mann-Whitney's U-test where appropriate. Linear regression analysis and the Pearson correlation coefficient were used to determine the levels of correlation. RESULTS: The difference in 60-minute forearm flow at the start of the study (t0) was not statistically significant between groups, while at t2 and t3 significantly higher values were recorded in Group 1 (t2; Group 1: 420.6 +/- 188.8 ml/100 ml tissue; Group 2: 266.1 +/- 122.2 ml/100 ml tissue (95% CI 30.9-278.0, P = 0.02); t3; Group 1: 369.9 +/- 150.3 ml/100 ml tissue; Group 2: 272.6 +/- 85.7 ml/100 ml tissue (95% CI 5.4-190.0, P = 0.04). At t1 a trend towards significantly higher values in Group 1 was noted (P = 0.05). The level of forearm flow was related to the amount of insulin infusion (r = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard treatment, intensive insulin treatment of critically ill patients increases forearm flow. Flow increase was weakly related to the insulin dose, though not to blood glucose concentration. TRIAL NUMBER: ISRCTN39026810."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiologic and therapeutic data, as well as the evolution of NTS in Morocco. METHOD: This retrospective study was made on 41 patients hospitalized for NTS between 1994 and 2002 in the Casablanca University Hospital Pediatric ward. RESULTS: Twenty cases of digestive salmonellosis were diagnosed, 16 cases of septicemia, and 10 cases of meningitis. Ten patients were hospitalized after an outbreak of resistant Salmonella typhimurium in a nursery. Fifty percent of the patients were less than 3 months of age. The three patients between 1 and 3 years of age presented with primary immunodeficiency. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea were noted in 97% of the cases. The stools were watery in 89% and severe dehydration in 55% of the cases. Salmonella strains were identified in blood in 25 cases, from stools in 10 cases, and from CSF in nine cases. The following Salmonella serotypes were identified: S. typhimurium (53.6%), S. enteritidis (44%), and S. agona (2.4%). Resistance to antibiotics was noted, especially for Salmonella typhimurium (34%) in the nursery outbreak. The evolution was favorable in 80%, but two children with meningitis developed severe neurological sequels, and six hypotrophic infants under 3 years of age died after septicemia."

PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight patients aged 65 and older with diabetes mellitus (DM) (57 female; 64.8%) and 118 controls without DM (75 female; 63.6%), matched for age and sex, hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis between January 1997 and December 2005. MEASUREMENTS: Medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and microbiological characteristics. RESULTS: The median age of both groups was 74 (range 65-95). Twenty-seven people with DM (30.7%) and 13 controls (11.0%) had bacteremia (P=.001). People with DM had longer fever (median 4.5 vs 2.5 days; P<.001), longer hospitalization (median 10 vs 7 days; P<.001), and greater mortality (12.5% vs 2.5%; P<.01) than controls. Logistic regression analysis proved DM to be an independent predictor of bacteremia, long hospitalization, and mortality. Escherichia coli was the most common microorganism found in both groups, whereas Candida spp. were implicated more frequently in people with DM than controls (12.7% vs 1.7%; P<.01). Antimicrobial resistance did not increase over the study period. CONCLUSION: Acute pyelonephritis in elderly people with DM is associated with risk of bacteremia, long hospitalization, and mortality."
41438280,Patterns and predictors of readmission among sepsis survivors in a tertiary emergency department in Ethiopia.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a leading cause of critical illness worldwide. Survivors often suffer long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments. Post-sepsis rehospitalization is common but poorly characterized in low-resource settings. We aimed to determine 30/90/180-day readmission rates and predictors after emergency sepsis in Addis Ababa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria (infection with >/=2-point rise in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]) admitted to a tertiary Ethiopian emergency department from 2019-2021. A modified SOFA score (five parameters) was used to define organ dysfunction, as has been validated for resource-limited settings. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease and malignancy), acute severity (modified SOFA, septic shock, intensive care unit admission), microbiology, antibiotic duration, and outcomes. Survivors were followed for 180 days for hospital readmissions at any site of suspected infection. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors independently associated with 180-day readmission. RESULTS: Of 110 sepsis patients, 39 (35.5%) died during index admission. Among 71 survivors, 32 (45.1%) were readmitted within 180 days (78.1% within 30 days; 15.6% days 31-90; 6.3% days 91-180). Infectious diagnoses accounted for 71.9% of readmissions (often recurrent pneumonia or urinary tract infection). Median time to first readmission was 16 days (interquartile range 5-41). Multivariable analysis showed higher odds of 180-day readmission in younger patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.53 per decade decrease in age, 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.87, P = 0.029), and lower odds in those with non-metastatic malignancy (adjusted OR 0.15, 0.03-0.75, P = 0.027) or longer index hospitalization (adjusted OR 0.31 per 5-day increase, 0.11-0.89, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of emergency sepsis survivors were readmitted within 180 days, predominantly within 30 days, and most readmissions were for infection. Predictors included younger age, malignancy status, and length of stay. These findings highlight the need for targeted discharge planning, antimicrobial stewardship, and early follow-up for high-risk patients in low-resource settings."
20079204,[The hemodynamic characteristic and prognosis significance of acute kidney injury caused by septic shock].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with septic shock, evaluate the impact of AKI stage on the prognosis of septic shock and explore the role of hemodynamics in the incidence of AKI. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the patients of septic shock who had been placed pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) continuously admitted in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January, 2001 to June, 2008. Mortality and incidence of AKI were compared between groups of different AKI stages, survival analysis and prognosis evaluation were performed. The impacts of hemodynamics on the incidence of AKI were studied. RESULTS: Altogether 158 cases of septic shock were enrolled in this retrospective study. Of all the patients, the incidences of all AKI and stage 1 - 3 were 79.7% (126/158), 16.5% (26/158), 16.5% (26/158) and 46.8% (74/158) respectively; 45.6% (72/158) of all the patients needed renal alternative therapy. Ninety-four patients died within 28 days (59.5%). The mortality in the patients without AKI was 12.5%, while those with AKI and those at stages 1-3 of AKI were 38.5%, 69.2%, 83.8% and 71.4% (P < 0.05), with OR values at 4.38, 15.75, 36.17 and 17.50 respectively. The survival analysis showed that the survival rate decreased as AKI stage increasing. The ROC curve showed that the area under curve (AUC) was 0.811, with 95%CI at 0.738 - 0.883 (P < 0.001). The incidences of AKI in patients with different levels of mean arterial pressure (mAP) were 76.2% (90 - 100 mm Hg), 71.8% (80 - 90 mm Hg) and 94.4% (65 - 80 mm Hg) respectively. The incidences of AKI in patients with different levels of cardiac index (CI) were 76.7% (> 4.0 L x min(-1) x m(-2)), 71.2% (2.5 - 4.0 L x min(-1) x m(-2)) and 96.6% (< 2.5 L x min(-1) x m(-2)). CONCLUSION: Septic shock is highly associated with AKI and has poor prognosis. AKI stage of AKI net is an independent predictor of prognosis of septic shock. The change of hemodynamics has an important role on the development of septic AKI. It's useful to decrease the incidence of AKI by elevating the blood pressure and CI, but super-normal goal won't work better."
25618110,"ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated from bloodstream infections--antimicrobial susceptibility, conjugative transfer of resistance genes and phylogenetic origin.",2014,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) strains has increased dramatically over the past years. OBJECTIVES: Characterization of ESBL-EC isolates collected from BSIs with regard to their antimicrobial susceptibility and phylogenetic background. The conjugative transfer of resistance determinants to the E. coli reference strain K12 C600 was also investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A collection of forty-eight ESBL-EC strains recovered from BSIs was subjected to the study. These strains were obtained from the ICU (intensive care unit) of the Medical University Hospital, Wroclaw, Poland, during a four-year period (2009-2012). All the isolates were screened for ESBL production by the double disk synergy test (DDST). Transferability of plasmid-mediated resistance genes was performed by the conjugational broth method. Susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of clinical isolates and transconjugants was determined by the agar dilution method. PCR assay was used to detect the blaCTX-M gene in ESBL-EC tested and transconjugants. Affiliation to phylogenetic groups was done by the triplex PCR method. RESULTS: Conjugational transfer of plasmids responsible for ESBL to a recipient strain was successful for all the ESBL-EC analyzed (donors). The conjugation frequencies ranging from 2.3x10(-7) to 5.2x10(-1) per donor. In vitro susceptibility testing revealed that all the ESBL-EC isolates and their transconjugants were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested with the exception of carbapenems, tigecycline, and beta-lactam-clavulanate combinations. Moreover, all the donor strains and their transconjugants were found to contain the blaCTX-M gene. The majority of the isolates analyzed belonged to phylogroups B2 (62.5%) and D (25%), whereas groups B1 and A were less frequently represented (8.3% and 4.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study confirm the need of antibiotic policies and effective infection control measures in hospital settings to minimize BSIs caused by multi-resistant ESBL-producing pathogens."
19942591,Circulating microparticles and procoagulant activity in elderly patients.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MP) are shed membrane vesicles released from activation or apoptosis of several cell types and carry a procoagulant activity. Age is associated with a procoagulant state, but the role of MP in this setting is unknown, as the relationship of MP to aging in humans. We tested the hypotheses that elderly persons compared with young persons may have different patterns of expression of MP and procoagulant activity in stable or septic conditions. METHODS: Patients from Emergency and Geriatric Departments were divided into four groups according to their age (< 50 or > or = 75 years old) and the presence of systemic infection (yes or no). The diagnosis of infection was reached when it was classified as certain or possible by an expert panel. Circulating MP were isolated from venous citrated blood. Cytofluorometry using specific antibodies was performed to determine the origins of MP (endothelial microparticles [EMP], red blood cell microparticles, or platelet microparticles). Procoagulant activity was determined using annexin V (prothrombinase activity) and tissue factor (TF) assays. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients were included. Elderly patients expressed a decrease in EMP in stable conditions, associated with a decrease in procoagulant annexin V MP in septic conditions (p < .05), and higher EMP levels were found in elderly infected patients who died during hospital stay than in survivors (p = .04). Compared with young patients, response to sepsis was altered in elders concerning EMP, annexin V MP, and TF-bearing MP. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients expressed a different pattern of MP in stable conditions, with a different response to sepsis in procoagulant activity modification."
31881686,In Situ Growth of CuWO(4) Nanospheres over Graphene Oxide for Photoelectrochemical (PEC) Immunosensing of Clinical Biomarker.,2019,"Procalcitonin (PCT) protein has recently been identified as a clinical marker for bacterial infections based on its better sepsis sensitivity. Thus, an increased level of PCT could be linked with disease diagnosis and therapeutics. In this study, we describe the construction of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) PCT immunosensing platform based on it situ grown photo-active CuWO(4) nanospheres over reduced graphene oxide layers (CuWO(4)@rGO). The in situ growth strategy enabled the formation of small nanospheres (diameter of 200 nm), primarily composed of tiny self-assembled CuWO(4) nanoparticles (2-5 nm). The synergic coupling of CuWO(4) with rGO layers constructed an excellent photo-active heterojunction for photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing. The platform was then considered for electrocatalytic (EC) mechanism-based detection of PCT, where inhibition of the photocatalytic oxidation signal of ascorbic acid (AA), subsequent to the antibody-antigen interaction, was recorded as the primary signal response. This inhibition detection approach enabled sensitive detection of PCT in a concentration range of 10 pg.mL(-1) to 50 ng.mL(-1) with signal sensitivity achievable up to 0.15 pg.mL(-1). The proposed PEC hybrid (CuWO(4)@rGO) could further be engineered to detect other clinically important species."
19954475,Hemoperfusion with an immobilized polymyxin B fiber column decreases macrophage and monocyte activity.,2009,"We investigated whether direct hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was able to decrease macrophage and monocyte activity in patients with sepsis. Nineteen patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection and a mean arterial blood pressure > or =65 mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilution catheter was inserted prior to DHP-PMX for intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twice within 24 h for 3 h each time. Serum neopterin was measured four times: before DHP-PMX, and 24, 48, 72 h after it had begun. The serum concentrations of neopterin were 654 +/- 234 nmol/L prior to DHP-PMX vs. 573 +/- 196 nmol/L at 24 h, 452 +/- 161 nmol/L at 48 h, and 372 +/- 139 nmol/L at 72 h, showing a significant decrease from 48 h onwards compared with before treatment. These data suggest that DHP-PMX decreases macrophage and monocyte activity."
20084913,"[Prognostic value of serum TNF-alpha, IL-10, leptin and CRP levels in newborns with septicemia].",2009,"This study was aimed to investigate the prognostic value of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), leptin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in newborn sepsis. A total of 57 newborns with nosocomial sepsis and 30 healthy newborns were included to the study. Serum TNF-alpha, IL-10, leptin (Biosource, Belgium) and CRP (Dade Behring, Germany) levels were investigated by ELISA methodology before the initiation of the therapy (day 0) and on the third and fifth days of therapy. Initial leptin levels were found to be high in the control group (p = 0.00) and CRP levels were found to be high in the patient group (p = 0.00). No significant difference was detected for IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels (p > 0.05). CRP levels were significantly higher in the patient group than the controls on the third day of the therapy (p = 0.001), however, no significant difference was detected for the other parameters (p > 0.05). On the fifth day of the therapy CRP (p = 0.023) and leptin (p = 0.00) levels were significantly high in the patient group and TNF-alpha in the control group (p = 0.00) while no significant difference was observed for IL-10 levels (p > 0.05). Mortality rate was 24.5%. When the mean TNF-alpha, IL-10, leptin and CRP levels on the 0th, 3rd and 5th days were analysed for alive (n = 43) and dead (n = 14) newborns with sepsis, it was observed that TNF-alpha, IL-10 and CRP levels were related with poor prognosis (p < 0.05). The ROC analysis performed for the determination of the prognostic performance of TNF-alpha and IL-10 revealed that these parameters had predictive value about mortality when their levels were above certain cut-off values (on the 5th day of therapy for IL-10 > 1.8 ng/ml and for TNF-alpha > 21.1 ng/ml). It can be concluded that besides routine laboratory parameters, serum TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels at the initiation of therapy and afterwards may help to predict prognosis and guide treatment in newborns with sepsis."
31851725,Early neonatal outcomes of very-low-birth-weight infants in Turkey: A prospective multicenter study of the Turkish Neonatal Society.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early neonatal outcomes of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants discharged home from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed between April 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017. The study included VLBW infants admitted to level III NICUs. Perinatal and neonatal data of all infants born with a birth weight of </=1500 g were collected for infants who survived. RESULTS: Data from 69 NICUs were obtained. The mean birth weight and gestational age were 1137+/-245 g and 29+/-2.4 weeks, respectively. During the study period, 78% of VLBW infants survived to discharge and 48% of survived infants had no major neonatal morbidity. VLBW infants who survived were evaluated in terms of major morbidities: bronchopulmonary dysplasia was detected in 23.7% of infants, necrotizing enterocolitis in 9.1%, blood culture proven late-onset sepsis (LOS) in 21.1%, blood culture negative LOS in 21.3%, severe intraventricular hemorrhage in 5.4% and severe retinopathy of prematurity in 11.1%. Hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was diagnosed in 24.8% of infants. Antenatal steroids were administered to 42.9% of mothers. CONCLUSION: The present investigation is the first multicenter study to include epidemiological information on VLBW infants in Turkey. Morbidity rate in VLBW infants is a serious concern and higher than those in developed countries. Implementation of oxygen therapy with appropriate monitoring, better antenatal and neonatal care and control of sepsis may reduce the prevalence of neonatal morbidities. Therefore, monitoring standards of neonatal care and implementing quality improvement projects across the country are essential for improving neonatal outcomes in Turkish NICUs."
15605516,[Coagulation disorders following severe trauma: surgeon's role in prevention].,2004,"INTRODUCTION: Severe trauma must be considered a ""systemic disease"" that could lead to severe systemic complications. PHYSIOPATHOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS: Coagulation disorders are present in most trauma patients as hemorrhagic disorder, thrombosis, or like in DIC, with both coexistent phenomenon. Trauma determine the activations of intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, and of platelets. Intrinsic pathway activation induce a pro-coagulant function and the activation of fibrinolytic system. Both system activation explain low incidence of deep venous thrombosis. Post-traumatic activation of extrinsic coagulation lead to thrombin and fibrin production. In trauma patients platelets activation is related to endothelial damage, exposition of collagen, interaction with PAF and presence of microorganisms. Post-traumatic DIC is characterized by procoagulant factors activation, with intravascular deposit of fibrin and thrombosis, and by hemorrhagic disorders due to consumption of platelet and procoagulant factors. Lower levels of antithrombin III, in trauma patients, are strictly related to severity of damage and shock. Coagulation disorders related to sepsis, that often complicate trauma, are added to those determined by trauma, with a negative synergic effect. Medical treatment with massive infusion of colloid and crystalloid solution, and fluid, and massive transfusion of plasma and red blood cells can determine dilutional thrombocytopenia, reduced activity of coagulation factors and reduced haemostatic activity of RBC due to excessive haemodilution--Hct <20%. PREVENTION STRATEGY: To avoid post-traumatic coagulation disorders is important to prevent sepsis, thrombocytopenia and reduced activity of coagulation factors and of RBC, as well as prevent and immediately treat shock. The early use of high dose antithrombin concentrate, is important to prevent DIC and MOFS, and administer subcutaneous or intravenous heparin, in absence of hemorrhagic disorders that contraindicate its use."
18470715,Procalcitonin as a marker of nosocomial infections in the neonatal intensive care unit.,2000,"OBJECTIVE: To determine accuracy of procalcitonin concentrations for diagnosing nosocomial infections in critically ill neonates. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three neonates with nosocomial infection. Four controls matched for duration of hospital stay and birth date were chosen for each case patient. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: PCT concentrations were measured by the LUMItest procalcitonin kit at onset of signs of infection and after recovery. Range of PCT concentrations (ng/ml) was 2.0 to 249.1 in case patients and 0.08 to 1.0 in controls (sensitivity and specificity, 100%). PCT values returned to normal (<1.0 ng/ml) by day 3 to 7 of appropriate antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of PCT concentrations may be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of infectious complications in neonates during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit."
41472238,Pericarditis in a Child with COVID-19 Complicated by Streptococcus pneumoniae Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually mild, but in rare cases may lead to severe complications. Early recognition and comprehensive management are critical for favorable outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 2-year-old girl, previously healthy and unvaccinated against Streptococcus Pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute otitis media. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Antiviral and antibiotic treatment was initiated, but she remained febrile, polypneic, and tachycardic. The diagnosis of MIS-C was excluded; there was no involvement of two organs, and infection with S. pneumoniae serotype 19 F was identified. Given the unfavorable evolution, corticosteroid therapy and immunoglobulin were instituted, and subsequently, following the antibiogram result, antibiotic therapy was escalated to Meropenem and Linezolid. Clinical and laboratory parameters improved, but pericarditis with a small fluid slide and ECG changes were associated. The evolution was favorable with complete cardiac recovery at 30 days. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of vigilant assessment for secondary bacterial infections and cardiac complications in pediatric COVID-19. Prompt recognition and targeted treatment are essential, and pneumococcal vaccination remains a fundamental preventive measure. Moreover, the scarcity of literature documenting SARS-CoV-2 infections complicated by pericarditis further underscores the uniqueness of this case and its relevance for specialists in the field."
19949753,Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing phenotype signifies a poor prognosis for patients with cefpodoxime-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are a major concern. This study explored the clinical impact of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among cefpodoxime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia. METHODS: The medical charts and microbiological results of patients with cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae bacteremia in a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan between June 2003 and December 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics, medical histories, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. ESBL production was indicated by the double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: 278 episodes of bacteremia caused by cefpodoxime-resistant K. pneumoniae or E. coli were identified, of which 115 (41%) were ESBL producing. Compared with non-ESBL-producing bacteremia, bacteremic episodes caused by ESBL producers were less often community acquired (4.3% vs 26.4%; p < 0.001). Underlying diabetes mellitus (48.7% vs 35.0%; p = 0.02), liver cirrhosis (22.6% vs 11.7%; p = 0.02), or uremia (21.7% vs 3.7%; p < 0.001) were more common in ESBL-producing bacteremia. In contrast, solid tumors were more frequent in non-ESBL-producing bacteremia (44.8% vs 27.8%; p = 0.004). Overall, patients with ESBL-producing bacteremia had higher disease severity indicated by a Pittsburgh bacteremia score > or = 4, longer duration of hospital stay (51.1 days vs 31.9 days; p = 0.007), more admission to intensive care units (19.1% vs 8.0%; p = 0.006), and a higher mortality rate at 28 days (34.8% vs 23.9%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: ESBL production signifies a poor clinical outcome for patients with bacteremia caused by cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae."
15599254,T-cell sinonasal lymphoma presenting as acute orbit with extraocular muscle infiltration.,2004,"We describe a rare case of sinonasal T-cell lymphoma in an 11-year-old boy who presented with a right acute orbit characterized by proptosis, eyelid edema and erythema, limitation of eye movements, and excruciating pain on the right side of his face. Orbital computed tomography showed progressive right extraocular muscle enlargement. One biopsy specimen showed extensive tissue necrosis and an infiltrate of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei within the walls of blood vessels. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that these cells were positive for leucocyte common antigen (CD45), CD3 cytoplasmic, CD45RO, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and negative for CD20, CD57, CD56, CD99 and Epstein-Barr virus. Chemotherapy for T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was initiated, but the patient's status deteriorated and the child died of respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and central nervous system infection."
15666016,[Bacteremia -- prevalence and associated factors in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis].,2004,"BACKGROUND: Bacteremia seems to increase the morbidity and mortality in clinical and surgical conditions, however the importance and factors associated with it during acute calculous cholecystitis are not well established. The purpose of this study was to determine pre-operative prevalence, associated factors and prognosis of bacteremia in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis submitted to an emergency cholecystectomy. METHODS: A prospective study of 51 patients with histological diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis was designed. The Bactec System was used to detect bacteremia. Mean results of clinical and laboratory analyses were related to the presence of bacteremia. RESULTS: The pre-operative prevalence of bacteremia was of 15.68%. Age (P=0.024), heart rate (P=0.026), respiratory rate (P=0.028), serum creatinine (P=0.028) and presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P=0.016) were positively associated with bacteremia. Bacteremic patients had statistically higher overall (P=0.045) and infectious (P=0.039) complication rates and longer hospitalization (P<0.005) including one death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute calculous cholecystitis have a considerable prevalence of bacteremia in the pre-operative period. It is associated with old age, heart rate, respiratory rate, serum creatinine and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, presence of bacteremia may be associated to severity of the condition and poor outcome related to pos-operative complications."
25510957,Candida glabrata sepsis associated with chorioamnionitis in an IVF twin pregnancy: Should we deliver?,2015,"We report a case of in vitro fertilization (IVF)-acquired Candida glabrata chorioamnionitis successfully treated through systemic maternal antifungal treatment prior to delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of its kind in the literature. C. glabrata chorioamnionitis in pregnancy is rare, but the current literature suggests a very high fetal fatality in such cases. It is known to have an association with cervical stitch, amniocentesis, chorionic villous sampling, and assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF. Given the increasing global use of artificial reproductive techniques, it is important to raise awareness of this condition and highlight its potential complications. Early recognition of possible fetal infection could enable early initiation of systemic antifungal treatment. It would be prudent to consider early delivery once fetal maturity is achieved despite normal fetal monitoring."
20075551,"Establishment of population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in Bangalore, India.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is vaccine-preventable but few data on the incidence of PD exist for Indian children. AIMS: To assess the feasibility of implementing prospective, population-based surveillance for PD among children less than five years of age. Settings and Design :Hospitals and health agencies, Bangalore, India. Retrospective review and analysis of hospitalization records as well as public health and demographic data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records for 2006 hospitalizations for pneumococcal disease-associated syndromes (meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis) were identified at three pediatric referral hospitals (Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, Kempegowda Institute of Child Health and Vani Vilas Hospital) in Bangalore using International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes. Hospital microbiology laboratory records were assessed to ensure capacity for identifying S. pneumoniae. Population data were identified from national census and polio surveillance data. RESULTS: The Bangalore city southern zone includes 33 wards occupying 51 Km 2 with 150,945 children between 0-5 years of age served by three referral pediatric hospitals. From January--December 2006, records of these three hospitals showed 2,219 hospitalizations of children less than five years of age (967 pneumonia, 768 sepsis, and 484 meningitis) with PD-associated diagnoses (southern zone area incidence: 0.15/100,000 PD-associated hospitalizations, less than five years of age). There were 178 deaths in children less than five years of age, of which 87 were attributable to sepsis, 56 to pneumonia and 35 to meningitis. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that the PD-associated disease burden in Bangalore is high and local institutions have capacity for population-based surveillance. In a prospective study, systematic attention to potential barriers in identifying children with pneumococcal infections will improve estimation of IPD incidence in India."
18470712,The clinical value of procalcitonin in the prediction of infected necrosis in acute pancreatitis.,2000,"OBJECTIVE: Infection of pancreatic necrosis (IN) has a major impact on management and outcome in acute pancreatitis (AP). Currently, guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the only means for an accurate diagnosis of IN. Procalcitonin (PCT), a 116 amino acid pro-peptide of calcitonin has been found in high concentrations in patients with sepsis. In the present study we analyzed the clinical value of serum PCT for predicting IN in AP and compared the results to guided FNA. DESIGN: Clinical study. SETTING: A collaborative study between the Departments of General Surgery and Clinical Chemistry/ Pathobiochemistry of the University of Ulm, Germany. PATIENTS: 61 patients with AP entered this study and were stratified into three groups according to morphological and bacteriological data: I. 22 patients with edematous pancreatitis (AIP), II. 18 patients with sterile necrosis (SN), III. 21 patients with IN. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During an observation period of 14 days PCT was measured by immunoluminometry, CRP was determined by lasernephelometry on a routine base. In patients with IN overall PCT concentrations were significantly higher than in those with SN, whereas CRP levels did not differ in both groups. In contrast, only low concentrations of both parameters were found in patients with AIP. By ROC analysis the best PCT cut-off level for predicting IN or persisting pancreatic sepsis was obtained at > or =1.8 ng/ml. If this cut-off was reached on at least two consecutive days, IN could be predicted with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity, of 88%, and an accuracy of 90%. Guided FNA achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91%. 79%, and 84% in differentiating IN from SN, respectively. After surgical treatment of IN median PCT values continued to be significantly higher in patients with persisting pancreatic sepsis (n=12) compared to those with an uneventful postoperative course (n=7). Our results demonstrate that monitoring of serum PCT could serve as a noninvasive and accurate method to predict IN in AP as well as to select patients with persisting septic complications after surgical debridement."
25512799,Risk factors for mortality in children with diabetic keto acidosis from developing countries.,2014,"Diabetic keto acidosis (DKA) is the major cause for mortality in children with Diabetes mellitus (DM). With increasing incidence of type 1 DM worldwide, there is an absolute increase of DM among children between 0-14 year age group and overall incidence among less than 30 years remain the same. This shift towards younger age group is more of concern especially in developing countries where mortality in DKA is alarmingly high. Prior to the era of insulin, DKA was associated with 100% mortality and subsequently mortality rates have come down and is now, 0.15%-0.31% in developed countries. However the scenario in developing countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are very different and mortality is still high in children with DKA. Prospective studies on DKA in children are lacking in developing countries. Literature on DKA related mortality are based on retrospective studies and are very recent from countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. There exists an urgent need to understand the differences between developed and developing countries with respect to mortality rates and factors associated with increased mortality in children with DKA. Higher mortality rates, increased incidence of cerebral edema, sepsis, shock and renal failure have been identified among DKA in children from developing countries. Root cause for all these complications and increased mortality in DKA could be delayed diagnosis in children from developing countries. This necessitates creating awareness among parents, public and physicians by health education to identify symptoms of DM/DKA in children, in order to decrease mortality in DKA. Based on past experience in Parma, Italy it is possible to prevent occurrence of DKA both in new onset DM and in children with established DM, by simple interventions to increase awareness among public and physicians."
41424663,Hepatitis due to Enterovirus in a Child.,2025,"Enteroviruses are a common cause of infection in neonates, causing wide spectrum of diseases, including myocarditis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, and sepsis. The enteroviral hepatitis has rarely been recorded in pediatric populations other than neonates. We report a rare case of self-limiting acute hepatitis in a healthy 3-year-old child affected by hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by Enterovirus. Providers should be aware of hepatitis prevalence in the Enteroviral infection, and should consider it in the differential diagnosis for acute hepatitis of unknown origin."
20109983,Thrombocytopenia and outcome in critically ill patients with bloodstream infection.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Thrombocytopenia is common in intensive care units (ICUs), and is associated with a poor prognosis. An acute decrease in total platelet count is frequently observed in severe sepsis, followed by a relative increase indicating organ-failure recovery. However, few data are available describing this effect and its relationship with outcomes in specific subgroups of ICU patients. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted to investigate the incidence and prognosis of thrombocytopenia in a cohort of critically ill patients (n=155) with a microbiologically documented nosocomial bloodstream infection. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors. The ICU mortality rates increased according to severity of thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was independently associated with worse outcomes in ICU patients with nosocomial bloodstream infection. CONCLUSION: Determining trends in platelet counts is of additional prognostic value, compared with single measurements."
15646077,The role of host immunity in the control of HIV infection: from theory to diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.,2004,Different immune and virological responses to antiretroviral therapy were generally observed in a consistent part of treated patients. The immune reconstitution due to viral decay conseguent to antiretroviral therapy is principally divided in two phases (redistribution and repopulation). Several co-factors (in particular co-receptor and cytokine relationship with HIV infection) can interfere with the response to the antiviral drugs. The re-establishment of HIV target cells immune activation and the reduction of CD4 cell loss and turn-over must be considered.
19935734,Primary pelvic pyomyositis in a neonate.,2009,"Primary pyomyositis is a bacterial infection occurring in skeletal muscle with no obvious local or adjacent cause. It is classically an infection of the tropics, although it is reported in temperate climates with increasing frequency. Tropical pyomyositis occurs predominantly in children aged between 2 and 5 and in adults aged between 20 and 45 years, whereas most temperate pyomyositis cases occur in adults. Using a magnetic resonance imaging scan, we made the diagnosis of staphylococcal pelvic pyomyositis in a Swiss term-born infant with an initial working diagnosis of septic hip osteoarthritis."
20001878,"A new paradigm for treating infections: ""go hard and go home"".",2009,"There is now significant evidence that initial use of the correct antibiotic saves more lives than virtually all other intensive care therapy. This means covering all possible causative organisms with the initial empirical choice. For nosocomial sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics must be started as soon as the relevant samples have been taken for culture, with de-escalation of therapy targeted to the causative organisms when results and susceptibilities are available. There is an international trend to use shorter antibiotic courses. Pseudomonas pneumonia probably needs a 7-10 day course. In our ICU, provided the infection source is controlled, we seldom use antibiotic courses longer than 7 days. Evaluation of the kill characteristics of antibiotics in experimental models suggests that different classes of antibiotics should have different dosing regimens. For Beta- lactam antibiotics, the kill characteristic is almost entirely related to the time that tissue and plasma levels exceed a certain threshold, with no significant post-antibiotic effect, particularly against gram-negative organisms. Kill characteristics of other antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, relate to adequate peak concentrations and a significant post-antibiotic effect. Clinically, these kill characteristics translate into the need for appropriate doses of the various antibiotics in patients with sepsis. We have shown that some patients with normal serum creatinine levels have very high creatinine clearance rates; in ICU patients with sepsis, blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained with large fluid loads and inotropic agents, thereby raising creatinine clearance. High clearances produce low trough concentrations of antibiotic, with important implications for underdosing and the development of antibiotic resistance. The new paradigm for treating sepsis, particularly nosocomial sepsis, is: get it right the first time, hit hard up front, and use large doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics for a short period."
31832481,Acute Stroke After Upper Endoscopy in a Patient With a Suspected Atrioesophageal Fistula.,2019,"Atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare complication of atrial fibrillation ablation. We present a man with sepsis and frank hematemesis 3 weeks after atrial fibrillation ablation. Thoracic computed tomography showed no definitive evidence of AEF. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and subsequently developed an embolic stroke. In the operating room, he was found to have AEF. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for AEF because of its nonspecific presentation and difficulty in diagnosing with imaging or endoscopy. Once AEF is suspected, esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be avoided because of the risk of precipitating embolic events."
41624824,Case Report: Clinical characteristics and multidisciplinary collaborative management of congenital tuberculosis in extremely preterm twins and preterm infants: a report of three cases and literature review.,2025,"AIMS: This study aims to report three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in premature infants, systematically analyze their clinical characteristics, diagnostic processes, and treatment outcomes, explore the core role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) in optimizing diagnosis and treatment, and provide an evidence-based basis for early identification, precise diagnosis, and effective therapy to reduce high mortality rates and enhance clinical management levels. METHODS: Through retrospective case reports combined with a literature review, three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in extremely premature twins and a premature infant were reported. Integration of maternal history, placental pathology assessment (such as acid-fast staining positive bacilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis qPCR detection), imaging examinations (such as chest x-ray and CT), etiological tests (such as NGS), and fundus examination results. Treatment adopted individualized anti-tuberculosis regimens (isoniazid 10-15 mg/kg/d, rifampicin 15-20 mg/kg/d, pyrazinamide 20-30 mg/kg/d), collaboratively developed by MDT (neonatology, infectious diseases, pharmacists, and ophthalmology experts), combined with supportive therapies (such as mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and nutritional support). Follow-up evaluated growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS: This study reported three cases of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis, involving extremely premature twins at 27(+4) weeks (birth weights 890 g and 880 g) and one premature infant at 34(+1) weeks. The twins' mother had a history of tuberculosis of the uterus or uterine TB, fever during pregnancy, and postpartum confirmed tuberculosis (positive placental pathology and NGS); infants presented with respiratory distress and fever. Diagnostic basis included maternal history, placental pathology, NGS detection of Mycobacterium, and fundus examination (retinal white spot changes). Under MDT collaboration, anti-tuberculosis treatment (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide) and supportive therapy controlled the infection. The older twin (male) was hospitalized for 93 days, weight reached 3,670 g, and at follow-up to corrected age of 4.5 months, weight increased to 7.44 kg, length 59 cm; the younger twin (female) hospitalized for 60 days, weight 2,170 g, follow-up to corrected age of 4.5 months, weight 6.62 kg, length 54 cm. The twins had normal growth and development, no permanent visual impairment. The premature infant case was similar with good prognosis. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of maternal-fetal transmission of tuberculosis in extremely premature and premature infants is highly challenging due to the lack of specific symptoms, often misdiagnosed as sepsis or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This study observed through three cases that integrating chest imaging, etiological tests (such as NGS), placental pathology assessment, and fundus screening (such as retinal white spot changes) aids in early diagnosis. MDT collaboration in developing individualized anti-tuberculosis treatment plans (including isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide) supplemented with supportive therapy effectively improves infant prognosis, with normal weight gain post-discharge, good development, and no permanent visual damage. Strengthening prenatal screening and monitoring for high-risk pregnant women helps prevent such cases. In the future, multicenter studies should further optimize diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies to reduce mortality and improve neonatal quality of life."
20039882,The Plasmodium serine-type SERA proteases display distinct expression patterns and non-essential in vivo roles during life cycle progression of the malaria parasite.,2010,"Parasite proteases play key roles in several fundamental steps of the Plasmodium life cycle, including haemoglobin degradation, host cell invasion and parasite egress. Plasmodium exit from infected host cells appears to be mediated by a class of papain-like cysteine proteases called 'serine repeat antigens' (SERAs). A SERA subfamily, represented by Plasmodium falciparum SERA5, contains an atypical active site serine residue instead of a catalytic cysteine. Members of this SERAser subfamily are abundantly expressed in asexual blood stages, rendering them attractive drug and vaccine targets. In this study, we show by antibody localization and in vivo fluorescent tagging with the red fluorescent protein mCherry that the two P. berghei serine-type family members, PbSERA1 and PbSERA2, display differential expression towards the final stages of merozoite formation. Via targeted gene replacement, we generated single and double gene knockouts of the P. berghei SERAser genes. These loss-of-function lines progressed normally through the parasite life cycle, suggesting a specialized, non-vital role for serine-type SERAs in vivo. Parasites lacking PbSERAser showed increased expression of the cysteine-type PbSERA3. Compensatory mechanisms between distinct SERA subfamilies may thus explain the absence of phenotypical defect in SERAser disruptants, and challenge the suitability to develop potent antimalarial drugs based on specific inhibitors of Plasmodium serine-type SERAs."
26202645,Procalcitonin as a marker of sepsis in alcoholic hepatitis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of sepsis in alcoholic hepatitis is important for selecting the appropriate therapy. The role of procalcitonin (PCT) to diagnose sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is not yet clear. METHODS: All patients admitted with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS underwent measurement of serum PCT and C reactive protein (CRP) levels within 24 h of admission. Patients were classified into two groups: group 1, alcoholic hepatitis with SIRS alone; group 2, alcoholic hepatitis with SIRS and sepsis. The ability of PCT to predict sepsis was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to compare the two groups. RESULTS: The study included 11 patients in group 1 and 29 in group 2. All were male (median age 42 years; range, 24-65 years). Age, dose and duration of alcohol intake, biochemical parameters and median MELD score were not significantly different between the two groups. PCT and CRP were significantly higher among group 2 than group 1 patients (p < 0.05). ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.81 (95 % CI 0.66-0.96) and 0.83 (95 % CI 0.68-0.93) for PCT and CRP, respectively, in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS without sepsis. A cutoff level of 0.57 mcg/l for PCT (sensitivity 79 %, specificity 82 %) for diagnosing sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS was comparable to a serum CRP cutoff level of 2.3 mg/dl (sensitivity 82.0 %, specificity 75 %). CONCLUSION: Serum PCT can be a useful marker for diagnosing sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS and compares favorably with serum CRP levels."
25831703,[Efficiency of high-volume hemofiltration in patients with severe sepsis and intracranial hypertension].,2014,"We performed a retrospective study in 68 patients (144 procedures) with severe sepsis and intracranial hypertension measured by the pressure in the central retinal vein. The patients underwent high-volume hemofiltration (HV-HF) for extrarenal indications. Increased pressure in the central retinal vein was accompanied by critical points of cerebral perfusion pressure and the growth of neurological deficit with inhibition level of consciousness to coma 1. In this case, IHV-HF may be associated with the formation of the critical points of cerebral perfihsion and severe disorders of microcirculation and the lack of resolution of tissue hypoperfusion. In case of intracranial hypertension IHV-HF is not effective in the category of patients where there is a combination DeltapCO2 > 5.9 mm Hg level and GCS <10 points."
31814964,Next-generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA for rapid noninvasive diagnosis of infectious diseases in immunocompromised hosts.,2019,"Background: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing has emerged as an effective laboratory method for rapid and noninvasive diagnosis in prenatal screening testing, organ transplant rejection screening, and oncology liquid biopsies but clinical experience for use of this technology in diagnostic evaluation of infections in immunocompromised hosts is limited.  Methods: We conducted an exploratory study using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detection of microbial cfDNA in a cohort of ten immunocompromised patients with febrile neutropenia, pneumonia or intra-abdominal infection.  Results: Pathogen identification by cfDNA NGS demonstrated positive agreement with conventional diagnostic laboratory methods in 7 (70%) cases, including patients with proven/probable invasive aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia, Cytomegalovirus and Adenovirus viremia. NGS results were discordant in 3 (30%) cases including two patients with culture negative sepsis who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant in whom cfDNA testing identified the potential etiological agent of sepsis; and one kidney transplant recipient with invasive aspergillosis who had received >6 months of antifungal therapy prior to NGS testing. Conclusion: These observations support the clinical utility of measurement of microbial cfDNA sequencing from peripheral blood for rapid noninvasive diagnosis of infections in immunocompromised hosts. Larger studies are needed."
31889940,The plasma peptides of breast versus ovarian cancer.,2019,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to demonstrate a proof of principle that proteomics has the capacity to analyze plasma from breast cancer versus other diseases and controls in a multisite clinical trial design. The peptides or proteins that show a high observation frequency, and/or precursor intensity, specific to breast cancer plasma might be discovered by comparison to other diseases and matched controls. The endogenous tryptic peptides of breast cancer plasma were compared to ovarian cancer, female normal, sepsis, heart attack, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis along with the institution-matched normal and control samples collected directly onto ice. METHODS: Endogenous tryptic peptides were extracted from individual breast cancer and control EDTA plasma samples in a step gradient of acetonitrile, and collected over preparative C18 for LC-ESI-MS/MS with a set of LTQ XL linear quadrupole ion traps working together in parallel to randomly and independently sample clinical populations. The MS/MS spectra were fit to fully tryptic peptides or phosphopeptides within proteins using the X!TANDEM algorithm. The protein observation frequency was counted using the SEQUEST algorithm after selecting the single best charge state and peptide sequence for each MS/MS spectra. The observation frequency was subsequently tested by Chi Square analysis. The log(10) precursor intensity was compared by ANOVA in the R statistical system. RESULTS: Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as APOE, C4A, C4B, C3, APOA1, APOC2, APOC4, ITIH3 and ITIH4 showed increased observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in breast cancer. Many cellular proteins also showed large changes in frequency by Chi Square (chi(2) > 100, p < 0.0001) in the breast cancer samples such as CPEB1, LTBP4, HIF-1A, IGHE, RAB44, NEFM, C19orf82, SLC35B1, 1D12A, C8orf34, HIF1A, OCLN, EYA1, HLA-DRB1, LARS, PTPDC1, WWC1, ZNF562, PTMA, MGAT1, NDUFA1, NOGOC, OR1E1, OR1E2, CFI, HSA12, GCSH, ELTD1, TBX15, NR2C2, FLJ00045, PDLIM1, GALNT9, ASH2L, PPFIBP1, LRRC4B, SLCO3A1, BHMT2, CS, FAM188B2, LGALS7, SAT2, SFRS8, SLC22A12, WNT9B, SLC2A4, ZNF101, WT1, CCDC47, ERLIN1, SPFH1, EID2, THOC1, DDX47, MREG, PTPRE, EMILIN1, DKFZp779G1236 and MAP3K8 among others. The protein gene symbols with large Chi Square values were significantly enriched in proteins that showed a complex set of previously established functional and structural relationships by STRING analysis. An increase in mean precursor intensity of peptides was observed for QSER1 as well as SLC35B1, IQCJ-SCHIP1, MREG, BHMT2, LGALS7, THOC1, ANXA4, DHDDS, SAT2, PTMA and FYCO1 among others. In contrast, the QSER1 peptide QPKVKAEPPPK was apparently specific to ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: There was striking agreement between the breast cancer plasma peptides and proteins discovered by LC-ESI-MS/MS with previous biomarkers from tumors, cells lines or body fluids by genetic or biochemical methods. The results indicate that variation in plasma peptides from breast cancer versus ovarian cancer may be directly discovered by LC-ESI-MS/MS that will be a powerful tool for clinical research. It may be possible to use a battery of sensitive and robust linear quadrupole ion traps for random and independent sampling of plasma from a multisite clinical trial."
31815280,"Gram-negative bloodstream infections and sepsis: risk factors, screening tools and surveillance.",2019,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Incidence of gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSIs) and sepsis are rising in the UK. Healthcare-associated risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of infection and associated mortality. Current research is focused on identifying high-risk patients and improving the methods used for surveillance. SOURCES OF DATA: Comprehensive literature search of the topic area using PubMed (Medline). Government, professional and societal publications were also reviewed. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: A range of healthcare-associated risk factors independently associate with the risk of GNBSIs and sepsis. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: There are calls to move away from using simple comorbidity scores to predict the risk of sepsis-associated mortality, instead more advanced multimorbidity models should be considered. GROWING POINTS AND AREAS FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Advanced risk models should be created and evaluated for their ability to predict sepsis-associated mortality. Investigations into the accuracy of NEWS2 to predict sepsis-associated mortality are required."
31830702,Ghrelin alterations during experimental and human sepsis.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is a hormone mainly produced by cells of the gastric mucosa, which has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The objective of the study was to investigate ghrelin levels during sepsis, as well as in an experimental sepsis model. METHODS: All consecutive admissions to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in Athens, Greece were screened for eligibility during the study. Thirty four non-septic patients upon ICU admission who subsequently developed sepsis were enrolled. Clinical data and scores were recorded, and blood samples were obtained at baseline (upon ICU admission), and at sepsis development. Total and active ghrelin, leptin, and cytokines were measured. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to mice in order to induce endotoxemia and at specified time points, blood and tissue samples were collected. RESULTS: In patients, serum total and active ghrelin concentrations were significantly elevated in sepsis compared to baseline (553.8 +/- 213.4 vs 193.5 +/- 123.2, p < 0.001; 254.3 +/- 70.6 vs 56.49 +/- 16.3, p < 0.001). Active ghrelin levels at the sepsis stage were inversely correlated with SOFA score and length of stay in the ICU (p = 0.023 and p = 0.027 respectively). In the mouse endotoxemia model ghrelin levels were elevated following LPS treatment, and the same trend was observed for leptin, TNFalpha and IL-6. Ghrelin administration managed to reduce IL-6 levels in mouse serum and in BALF. Pulmonary expression of ghrelin and its receptor GHSR1a was found decreased in LPS-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: In a well-defined cohort of ICU patients, we have demonstrated that active and total ghrelin increase in sepsis. The same is true for the experimental sepsis model used in the study. The inverse correlation of active ghrelin levels with SOFA score and length of ICU stay among septic patients is indicative of a potential protective role of active ghrelin during the septic process."
15887385,Acute necrotising pancreatitis following grain overload in a donkey.,2004,"A donkey developed abdominal discomfort and distension together with cardiovascular collapse and gastric reflux 24 to 36 hours after ingesting a large amount of poultry feed. Rectal findings prompted a laparotomy that identified extensive gastric dilation, an empty, atonic small intestine, dry colonic content and an easily corrected caecal displacement. These findings were not consistent with the severity of the signs, which were attributed to endotoxaemia. The donkey was euthanased during recovery. Necropsy revealed acute necrotising pancreatitis with massive gastric dilation and right dorsal colon impaction. The clinicopathological features of acute equine pancreatitis associated with grain overload are discussed."
25527447,Impact of same-day antibiotic susceptibility testing on time to appropriate antibiotic treatment of patients with bacteraemia: a randomised controlled trial.,2015,"Inadequate therapy in bloodstream infections is suggested to be associated with higher mortality. We evaluated the reduction in inappropriate antibiotic therapy using rapid identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (FAST) compared to standard of care (SOC) testing in patients with bloodstream infections. The FAST method used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification and to detect growth in the presence or absence of antibiotics after only 6 h. For SOC testing, the BD Phoenix system was used. Patients with blood cultures growing Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Enterococcus species or Gram-negative rods were randomised for FAST or SOC tests. A total of 129 patients were randomised for FAST and 121 patients for the SOC group. At the time SOC results became available, 78 patients in the FAST group could have been switched to more appropriate therapy. Although FAST results were highly accurate (agreement with SOC was 94%), they were only implemented in a minority (16) of patients. However, significantly fewer patients in the FAST group used inappropriate therapy at the time of SOC results (p = 0.025). The time to results in the FAST group was reduced by 15.6 h (p < 0.001). In the patients switched after FAST, this was done after a mean of 42.3 h compared to 61.4 h in those switched after SOC tests (p < 0.001). In bacteraemic patients, FAST resulted in significantly more patients using appropriate antibiotic therapy at the time SOC results were available and 15.6 h earlier than SOC tests. However, the implementation of FAST results was not optimal and no benefit on clinical outcome was shown."
32173814,Anguillulosis: circumstances of infestation and evolution towards the malignant form.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Anguillulosis is a ubiquitous digestive parasitosis. Rare in Tunisia, it is due to a round worm, strongyloid stercoralis, whose natural lodging is the duodeno-jejunal mucosa. Its malignant form is rare but it represents a potentially life-threatening disease. AIM: We report a case of malignant anguillulosis occurring in a context of immunosuppression. OBSERVATION: The case we report is about a 46-year-old man treated by a long-term corticosteroid therapy for Takayasu disease. He was hospitalized for an acute digestive syndrome. Biopsies were performed but the evolution was rapidly marked by multiorgan failure, sepsis and death of the patient. Histological analysis of the digestive biopsies concluded to an oeso-gastroduodenal anguillulosis. CONCLUSION: Anguillulosis is a rare parasitosis but it can pose a health problem especially in its malignant form wich can be a life-threatening."
41624750,"The role of artificial intelligence in burn assessment, complication diagnosis, and outcome prediction: a narrative review.",2026,"Burn injury remains a major global health challenge, causing an estimated 180 000 deaths annually. The marked heterogeneity in burn severity, complications, and outcomes highlights the need for more objective and efficient evaluation strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to support clinical decision-making and improve patient care in this field. In this narrative review, we summarize the growing applications of AI in burn care, including the assessment of burn depth and total body surface area, monitoring of wound healing, prediction of postburn complications, and estimation of clinical outcomes. AI-based models have demonstrated strong performance in automating wound assessment, optimizing fluid resuscitation, and predicting complications such as sepsis, inhalation injury, and acute kidney injury. Furthermore, AI-driven prediction of mortality risk and hospital length of stay has shown potential to inform early interventions and improve resource allocation. Despite encouraging progress, most studies to date rely on small, single-center datasets and limited model validation, underscoring the need for larger, multi-institutional efforts, and standardized data sharing. Integrating AI into burn management holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic precision, forecasting outcomes, and personalizing treatment strategies. As these technologies advance, clinician familiarity and collaboration with AI tools will be critical to fully realize their potential in transforming burn care."
31859672,Digital Alerting and Outcomes in Patients With Sepsis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and management of sepsis remain a global health care challenge. Digital technologies have the potential to improve sepsis care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to systematically review the evidence on the impact of digital alerting systems on sepsis related outcomes. METHODS: The following databases were searched for studies published from April 1964 to February 12, 2019, with no language restriction: EMBASE, MEDLINE, HMIC, PsycINFO, and Cochrane. All full-text reports of studies identified as potentially eligible after title and abstract reviews were obtained for further review. The search was limited to adult inpatients. Relevant articles were hand searched for other studies. Only studies with clear pre- and postalerting phases were included. Primary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and intensive care LOS, whereas secondary outcomes were time to antibiotics and mortality. Studies based solely on intensive care, case reports, narrative reviews, editorials, and commentaries were excluded. All other trial designs were included. A qualitative assessment and meta-analysis were performed. RESULTS: This review identified 72 full-text articles. From these, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of these, 8 studies reviewed hospital LOS, 12 reviewed mortality outcomes, 5 studies explored time to antibiotics, and 5 studies investigated intensive care unit (ICU) LOS. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the studies were performed. There was evidence of a significant benefit of digital alerting in hospital LOS, which reduced by 1.31 days (P=.014), and ICU LOS, which reduced by 0.766 days (P=.007). There was no significant association between digital alerts and mortality (mean decrease 11.4%; P=.77) or time to antibiotics (mean decrease 126 min; P=.13). CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that digital alerts can considerably reduce hospital and ICU stay for patients with sepsis. Further studies including randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings and identify the choice of alerting system according to the patient status and pathological cohort."
31814032,"Candida palmioleophila isolation in Italy from two cases of systemic infection, after a CHROMagar and Vitek system mis-identification as C. albicans.",2020,"A correct, fast, reliable identification method is pivotal in nosocomial environments to guide treatment strategies, whereas misidentification might lead to treatment failure. For routine identifications the Vitek system and CHROMagar are widely used but not always reliable, especially now with an increasing number of new emerging fungal pathogens that need careful identification. Here we describe two cases of candidemia, due to Candida palmioleophila previously misidentified as Candida albicans by using the Vitek2 system and CHROMagar. The first case is a 54-year-old man with an infected ulcer in the lower right limb, treated with a targeted therapy using a central venous catheter (CVC). After two months he developed a CVC-related candidemia MDR identified as C. albicans. The second case is a 2-month-old male baby that was admitted to the neonatal unit with acute respiratory failure due to a severe community-acquired bilateral pneumonia; blood cultures were all positive for C. albicans MDR. The isolated strains where re-identified with Maldi-Tof and DNA sequencing as C. palmioleophila. From the identification point of view, CHROMagar can be clearly misleading, especially because CHROMagar types currently available are not designed to discriminate new emerging species, suggesting that systems other than MALDI-TOF and marker sequencing may be inadequate even for routine identification and could contribute to producing misleading identifications and therapeutically wrong practices, leading to failures and patient death."
25971828,Waugh syndrome: a report of 7 patients and review of the published reports.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Waugh syndrome (WS) is the association of intussusception and intestinal malrotation. The association is rarely reported in the literature though intussusception is a commonly encountered problem in pediatric patients as a cause of intestinal obstruction. We present our experience in 7 patients with a review of published reports. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of 7 patients with the diagnosis of Waugh syndrome who were treated at our department between February 1982 to December 2012. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with Waugh syndrome presented to our unit during the period February 1982 to December 2012. The clinical findings and management are presented and discussed. RESULTS: Seven patients (three males and four females) presented with intussusception in association with mal.rotation. The age range was from 4 to 11 months; the patients had bilious vomiting and blood in the stool; the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound (2), Ba enema (2) and intraoperatively (3). All required operative intervention; either manual reduction or bowel resection and Ladd procedure; one patient died of sepsis; recurrence of obstruction was seen in another patient while the rest did well postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The relationship between intestinal malrotation and intussusceptions may be more frequent than is reported; failure of non-operative management of intussusception may be due to this association and hence brings the attention to its existence. A prospective study is needed to look for intestinal malrotation in patient with intussusceptions who undergo abdominal sonographic examination to determine the true incidence of this association. The anomaly is suspected by presence of a reversed anatomic relationship of the superior mesenteric artery and vein and in such cases to perform an upper gastrointestinal contrast study to define the exact location of the duodenojejuonal (DJ)."
20036064,Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) antibody levels in Japanese children.,2010,"Children with burns have a greater risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) than adults. This risk is thought to be associated with colonisation by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus in children with insufficient antibody titers. The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because, in the early stages, its signs and symptoms resemble those of other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly, the mortality rate is high. This study was designed to determine the titers of TSST-1 serum antibody in Japanese children, in order to prevent TSS and facilitate its early diagnosis. Between May 2006 and May 2007, we studied 119 patients who were treated in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of Kanazawa Medical University Hospital. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test the level of the IgG antibody to TSST-1 in the patients' serum samples. The percentage of cases testing for TSST-1 antibody in the patients under 6 months old was 78.6%, and it was lowest (21.3%) in the age group from 6 to 12 months old. The group of patients older than 41 years showed the highest rate of positivity (100.0%) for TSST-1 antibody. Higher titers of TSST-1 antibody were found within the first 6 months after birth, and lower titers were found between 6 months and 2 years old. The titers began to increase again after age three. The high morbidity of TSS in children around 2 years of age was proven to be related to changes in the titers of TSST-1 antibody. Infants under 6 months old are protected from TSS because of the high level of TSST-1 antibody they receive from their mother. Children are at risk of developing staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome when their immune system is immature and they have no protective circulating anti-TSS antibodies."
25494685,"The yield of universal antibody to hepatitis B core antigen donor screening in the Netherlands, a hepatitis B virus low-endemic country.",2015,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, universal antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) donor screening was introduced in July 2011 to intercept potentially infectious donations slipping through hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA minipool screening (HBV DNA MP6). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The yield and donor loss were evaluated after the first 2 years of universal anti-HBc donor screening. A total of 382,173 donors were tested for anti-HBc and, if positive, for antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Anti-HBc-reactive donors with anti-HBs of less than 200 IU/L were deferred, but repeat donors were allowed retesting after 6 months if anti-HBs was less than 10 IU/mL. Anti-HBc false positivity was estimated using the crude anti-HBc signal, family name-based ethnicity scoring, and donor follow-up. RESULTS: Anti-HBc screening identified 13 confirmed or potential HBsAg- and HBV DNA MP6-negative recent HBV infections. In addition, 820 anti-HBc-reactive donors with low anti-HBs titers (<200 IU/mL), potentially harboring occult HBV infection (OBI), were identified and deferred. Overall, 1583 (0.41%) donors were deferred: 1178 (0.31%) during first-time anti-HBc screening, 361 (0.09%) anti-HBc seroconverters, and 44 (0.01%) donors with waning anti-HBs titers. Only 188 of 1583 (12%) deferred donors could be reentered upon retesting. Estimated anti-HBc false positivity was 16%, but varied greatly among anti-HBc-reactive donors with and without anti-HBs (8% vs. 62%). CONCLUSION: Anti-HBc testing has improved the safety of the Dutch blood supply but its exact yield remains difficult to determine, due to the complexity of confirming anti-HBc reactivity and OBI. In a low-endemic country, donor loss associated with anti-HBc screening is sustainable, but adds to the already considerable list of donor exclusions."
41517263,"Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: IL-6 Dynamics, Inflammatory Phenotypes, and Short-Term Organ-Failure Trajectories in a Real-World Cohort.",2025,"Background and Objectives: In severe COVID-19-associated sepsis, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is used as a rescue strategy to modulate cytokine and coagulation derangements, but its biomarker and organ-failure effects remain incompletely characterised. We evaluated peri-procedural changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), other inflammatory markers, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores according to TPE intensity, timing, and inflammatory phenotypes. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study including 102 mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-associated sepsis who received >/=1 TPE session. Patients were grouped by number of sessions (1, 2, >/=3), timing (</=14 vs. >14 days from symptom onset), IL-6 responder status (>/=50% reduction), and two unsupervised inflammatory-thrombotic clusters. Peri-procedural changes (Delta) in biomarkers and SOFA were compared using non-parametric tests, with multivariable logistic and linear regression exploring predictors of IL-6 response and DeltaSOFA. Results: Baseline severity was similar across TPE-intensity groups, with median APACHE II scores of 11-12 and SOFA scores around 7 in all strata. Median IL-6 concentrations declined after TPE in each group (e.g., Delta -59.4 pg/mL after 1 session and Delta -65.1 pg/mL after >/=3 sessions), but between-group differences in DeltaIL-6 were not statistically significant (p = 0.276). By contrast, D-dimer exhibited a marked decline only in the 1-session group (median Delta -1.7 mg/L vs. ~0.0 mg/L in the 2- and >/=3-session groups; p < 0.001). Timing (early vs. late TPE) did not materially affect DeltaIL-6, DeltaCRP, DeltaSOFA (median 0.0 in both), or DeltaD-dimer. Overall, 50% of patients were IL-6 responders; baseline IL-6 was the only independent predictor (adjusted OR 1.9 per doubling, 95% CI 1.3-2.8). A hyperinflammatory-thrombotic cluster (n = 44) exhibited higher baseline IL-6 (612.3 vs. 92.4 pg/mL), more >/=3-session TPE (65.9% vs. 29.3%), and higher IL-6 responder rates (75.0% vs. 31.0%), but similar 28-day mortality (40.9% vs. 29.3%). Conclusions: In this real-world TPE programme, biochemical improvements-particularly IL-6 and D-dimer reductions in hyperinflammatory-thrombotic patients-were not consistently accompanied by short-term SOFA or survival benefits, underscoring the need for phenotype-guided and trial-based use."
25528522,Protective immune response to liposome adjuvanted high potency foot-and-mouth disease vaccine in Indian cattle.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines applied for prophylactic use in endemic areas provide short-lived immunity requiring regular boosters. Indian FMD control program recommends twice a year vaccination. Development of high potency vaccines that provide better immune response can singificantly contribute to control programme by reducing the frequency of vaccination. The present study explores new adjuvants to enhance the protective efficacy of inactivated trivalent FMD vaccines. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VacciMax((R)) is a novel adjuvant which uses a liposome-based oil emulsion platform. Cattle were immunized using VacciMax-A and VacciMax-B FMD vaccines and evaluated for protective efficacy. Similar groups of animals were also boosted after 6 months to study the effect of booster immunisation on protection against homologous challenge. Serum samples from immunized animals were tested by virus neutralization test (VNT) and liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE). After challenge, animals were screened for virus load by real-time PCR and reactivity in non-structural protein (3ABC) antibody detection ELISA to corroborate the protection data. A single dose of VacciMax-A formulation elicited higher percentage protection (63%) in VacciMax-A compared to 25% in VacciMax-B upon challenge at one-year post-vaccination. Upon boosting at 6 months also, VacciMax-A group showed higher levels of protection (100%) compared to VacciMax-B (86%), even though both the groups elicited comparable VNT titre (p=0.4964). The results also demonstrated that intramuscular route was preferrable over subcutaneous route of administration. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that immunization with VacciMax-A-IM adjuvanted FMD vaccine with high antigen payload under boosting regimen could effectively be used as potent vaccine to maintain herd immunity."
41431914,Calcific Uremic Panniculitis: A Rare Form of Calciphylaxis in an Endstage Renal Disease Patient.,2025,"Calcific uremic panniculitis is a rare cutaneous calcinosis on the spectrum of calciphylaxis. It mainly affects patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The mortality rate is high, approaching 50% of cases. We report the case of a patient on chronic hemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism who developed calcific panniculitis. The diagnosis was clinical: bluish subcutaneous nodules in the abdomen with rapid extension to the lower limbs and even the back, which quickly became necrotic. X-rays of the abdomen and lower limbs showed rounded calcifications in the fatty tissue. The evolution was rapidly fatal and the patient died of septic shock following superimposed infection of the lesions. Calcific uremic panniculitis is an increasingly rare fatal complication associated with ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The treatment remains poorly understood and difficult to apply, hence the importance of preventing this complication."
41444527,Prognostic value of the obstetric specific scoring systems and four years' experience of a tertiary center.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Obstetric sepsis is a significant and preventable cause of maternal mortality. The obstetric modified SOFA (omSOFA) score was created to diagnose sepsis in this population, and the sepsis in obstetrics score (SOS) was developed to predict the need for ICU care. This study investigated the prognostic value of these scores in patients treated in the ICU for obstetric sepsis, analyzed the patients' characteristics, and examined the perinatal outcomes associated with sepsis. METHODS: The study was retrospectively designed, and patients hospitalized in the ICU due to maternal sepsis were evaluated. These patients were divided into two groups based on the length of ICU stay. An ICU stay exceeding 72 h is considered a prolonged stay. The data, including demographics, laboratory results and obstetric outcomes, were compared between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to investigate the performance of omSOFA and SOS scores in predicting prolonged ICU stay and septic shock. RESULTS: The study included 25 women with maternal sepsis. Sepsis developed during pregnancy in 40% of patients, after cesarean section in 28%, after abortion in 20%, and after vaginal delivery in 12%. Septic shock developed in 12% (n = 3) of patients during ICU hospitalization. SOS showed better performance in predicting the need for ICU longer than 72 h (cut-off: 3, AUC:0.865, CI:0.721-1.000, sensitivity:75%, specificity:100% PPV:100% NPV:92.7% p = 0.003). At the same time, omSOFA performed better in predicting septic shock (cut-off: 5, AUC:0.985, CI: 0.941-1.000, sensitivity:100% specificity:95%, PPV:73.2%, NPV:100% p = 0.007). DISCUSSION: Considering that prolonged stay in the ICU and development of septic shock are important determinants of morbidity and mortality, SOS and omSOFA scores could serve as valuable prognostic tools in obstetric sepsis cases."
25531235,Role of hemodialysis with high cut-off membranes in a patient with a non-recognized leishmaniasis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: We report here a case of a woman affected by fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, and leucopenia associated with trombocytopenia, transferred to the intensive care unit with acute kidney injury and septic shock. METHODS: Patient was treated with high cut-off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (HCO-CVVHD). RESULTS: During treatment, the patient experienced a stable improvement in the hemodynamic, pulmonary function and tissue perfusion parameters. After 48 h of treatment, significant reductions in SOFA score (from 12, before starting the procedure, to 6) and in serum inflammatory mediators (as IL-6, from 599-568 pg/ml) were observed. Leishmania infection was identified as responsible of the septic condition only 48 h after removing hemodialysis. Antiprotozoal therapy was begun and the patient discharged. CONCLUSIONS: By supporting the renal function and reducing systemic inflammation, HCO-CVVHD could be a useful bridge therapy. This procedure allowed the medical team to gain sufficient time to diagnose the type of infection and begin an etiological therapy."
17021539,Disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulation disorders.,2004,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An update on recent developments in diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation. RECENT FINDINGS: Disseminated intravascular coagulation is defined as a typical disease condition with laboratory findings indicating massive coagulation activation and reduction in procoagulant capacity. Clinical syndromes associated with the condition are consumption coagulopathy, sepsis-induced purpura fulminans, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Consumption coagulopathy is observed in patients with sepsis, aortic aneurysms, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and other disseminated malignancies. Sepsis-induced purpura fulminans is characterized by microvascular occlusion causing hemorrhagic necrosis of the skin and organ failure. Viral hemorrhagic fevers result in massively increased tissue factor production in monocytes and macrophages, inducing microvascular thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Current scoring systems do not distinguish between patients with asymptomatic disseminated intravascular coagulation, consumption coagulopathy and thrombotic syndromes. Patients with sepsis may be identified by activated partial thromboplastin time waveform analysis performed as part of routine coagulation testing. Drotrecogin alpha (activated) reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis with and without disseminated intravascular coagulation and has been used in patients with sepsis-induced purpura fulminans. Tifacogin does not reduce mortality in severe sepsis associated with impaired coagulation. Patients with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation and severe sepsis showed a lower 28-day mortality than patients without this mutation, supporting the assumption that an enhanced level of coagulation activation may be beneficial in patients with severe sepsis. SUMMARY: Whereas antithrombin and tifacogin failed to improve clinical outcome in severe sepsis, drotrecogin alpha (activated) increased the chances of survival of patients with severe sepsis with and without disseminated intravascular coagulation."
31843287,A systematic review and meta-analysis of 30-day readmission rates following burns.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Unplanned hospital readmissions in surgical areas account for high costs and have become an area of focus for health care providers and insurance companies. The aim of this systematic review is to identify the rate and common reasons for unplanned 30-day readmission following burns. METHODS: This study was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Pubmed, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases were searched for publications without date or language restrictions. Extracted outcomes included 30-day readmission rate and reasons for readmission. Pooled 30-day readmission rate was estimated from weighted individual study estimates using random-effect models. Pooled estimates for risk factors are reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included into qualitative analysis and six (four adults, two children) into quantitative analysis. The overall readmission rate was 7.4% (95% CI 4.1-10.7) in adults and 2.7% (95% CI 2.2-3.2) in children. Based on two studies in 112,312 adult burn patients, burn size greater than 20% total body surface area (TBSA) was not a significant predictor of readmission rate (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.64-4.75; NS). The most common reasons were infection/sepsis, wound healing complications, and pain in both adults and children. DISCUSSION: Unplanned readmissions following burns are generally low and appear more common in adults than in pediatric patients. However, only few studies are reporting on 30-day readmission rates following burns. Evidence is limited to support a significant association between greater burn size and higher readmission rates. Since cost effectiveness and utilized hospital capacity are becoming an area of focus for improvement in health care, future studies should assess the risk factors of unplanned readmission following burns. Follow-up assessments and outpatient resources, even if not underlined by this data, could reduce readmission rates. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42019117649."
25716727,Bacterial lipopolysaccharide activates CD57-negative human NK cells.,2014,"NK cells play an important regulatory role in sepsis by induction and augmentation of proinflammatory reactions in early stages of the septic process and by suppression of immune response in later stages of inflammation. The present work was aimed at the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main pathogenic factor of sepsis development, on human NK cells ex vivo. We show that LPS activates immature CD57-negative NK cells, which typically constitute less than half of the normal NK cell population in human peripheral blood. Under conditions of NK cell stimulation with IL-2, addition of LPS provokes an increase in IFN-gamma production. However, LPS both increased and inhibited NK cell cytotoxic activity. It is important to note that the activation of NK cells on LPS addition was observed in the absence of TLR4 on the NK cell surface. These results confirm our previous data arguing for a direct interaction of LPS with NK cells and evidence an atypical mechanism of LPS-induced NK cell activation without the involvement of surface TLR4."
16566696,Acute hepatic failure caused by an acute aortic dissection with cardiac tamponade: a case report.,2004,"An acute cardiac tamponade from any cause may result in rapid deterioration of hepatic function in a previously healthy patient. We describe a case of an acute ascending aortic dissection that presented as acute hepatic failure, due to an acute cardiac tamponade and severe right heart failure. The differential diagnosis of the aetiology of acute liver failure is extensive and includes poisonings, vascular obstruction and sepsis, particularly on the background of decompensated liver disease. Many of these conditions are associated with hypotension. The acute presentation in our patient, combined with the lack of a characteristic history delayed the diagnosis of a proximal (type A) dissection with tamponade and subsequent hepatic failure. Severe right-sided heart failure as a result of conditions such as cardiac tamponade should be excluded in patients presenting with acute hepatic failure of unknown aetiology."
20025903,Monocyte HLA-DR expression as predictor of poor outcome in neonates with late onset neonatal sepsis.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: Down regulation of HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been reported in adult sepsis. The aims of this study were, first to evaluate monocyte HLA-DR expression in late onset neonatal infection and second to investigate the prognostic value of monocyte HLA-DR expression at onset of symptoms for the final outcome. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were taken from neonates, who were classified into three groups: late onset neonatal sepsis group (n=40); non-infective disorders group (n=24) and the control group (n=25). Monocyte expression of HLA-DR was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was lower in neonates with late onset sepsis (p<0.05). Of the 40 septic patients enrolled in the study, 32 survived, while 8 died. The percentage of HLA-DR expressing monocytes was significantly lower in the non-survivor sepsis group (16.6%) compared with that in the survivor sepsis group (45.2%). The optimal cutoff value of HLA-DR for predicting mortality was 30% with 87% sensitivity and 81% specificity. Patients with monocyte HLA-DR expression </=30% had lower survival rate with a 30-fold higher risk of mortality (Odds ratio 30; 95% CI 3-295). CONCLUSION: According to our findings, monocyte HLA-DR expression seems to be an early predictive marker for the prognosis in late onset neonatal sepsis."
25510798,"[Molecular markers: an important tool in the diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis].",2014,"Increase in the incidence of invasive aspergillosis has represented a difficult problem for management of patients with this infection due to its high rate of mortality, limited knowledge concerning its diagnosis, and therapeutic practice. The difficulty in management of patients with aspergillosis initiates with detection of the fungus in the specimens of immunosuppressed patients infected with Aspergillus fumigatus; in addition, difficulty exists in terms of the development of resistance to antifungals as a consequence of their indiscriminate use in prophylactic and therapeutic practice and to ignorance concerning the epidemiological data of aspergillosis. With the aim of resolving these problems, molecular markers is employed at present with specific and accurate results. However, in Mexico, the use of molecular markers has not yet been implemented in the routine of intrahospital laboratories; despite the fact that these molecular markers has been widely referred in the literature, it is necessary for it to validated and standardized to ensure that the results obtained in any laboratory would be reliable and comparable. In the present review, we present an update on the usefulness of molecular markers in accurate identification of A. fumigatus, detection of resistance to antifugal triazoles, and epidemiological studies for establishing the necessary measures for prevention and control of aspergillosis."
20338589,HMGB-1 as a useful prognostic biomarker in sepsis-induced organ failure in patients undergoing PMX-DHP.,2011,"BACKGROUND: High mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) has recently received attention as a late mediator of lipopolysaccharide-induced shock, and is thought to function as a mediator in such a disorder as multi-organ failure (MOF). In Japan, we have access to an immobilized polymyxin B fiber column using a direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) for patients with septic shock to improve hemodynamics and organ dysfunction. In this study, we looked at HMGB-1 levels in each category based on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores to further dissect its importance in specific aspects of organ failure in patients undergoing PMX-DHP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with septic shock (40 survivors and 20 non-survivors). We analyzed HMGB-1 and IL-6 levels before and after PMX-DHP and defined organ failure as two or more SOFA points. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between SOFA score and HMGB-1 level (P<0.05). The HMGB-1 level before PMX-DHP significantly increased as the number of organ failures increased (P<0.01: comparing 2 versus 5 organ failures). IL-6 levels decreased after PMX-DHP (P<0.05 compared with before PMX-DHP), but HMGB-1 levels remained unchanged. HMGB-1 levels of survivors with organ failure in liver decreased after PMX-DHP, but those of non-survivors significantly increased 24h after PMX-DHP compared with before PMX-DHP (P<0.01). In non-survivors with organ failure in liver, HMGB-1 levels were significantly higher than among survivors 24h after PMX-DHP (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HMGB-1 is a useful prognostic biomarker in sepsis-induced organ failure in patients undergoing PMX-DHP."
20028463,"Species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of blood Candida isolates at a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan, 1999-2006.",2011,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of candidaemia, consumption of fluconazole and susceptibility of blood Candida isolates at a tertiary hospital. From January 1999 to September 2006, all candidaemic episodes were identified and available strains were evaluated for the susceptibilities of antifungal agents. Annual defined daily doses of antifungal agents were collected. There had been 909 Candida isolates detected from the bloodstream of 843 patients during the study period. Among them, 740 isolates were available for the susceptibilities of antifungal agents. The incidence density of candidaemia was 28 episodes per 10,000 patient-days. Species distribution of 909 isolates did not vary annually, but varied greatly in the units of the hospital. Candida parapsilosis was the more prominent (30.1%) isolate in the paediatric units, where C. tropicalis and C. glabrata were less common (12.3% and 1.4% respectively). Resistance rates for itraconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole were 6.9%, 3.8% and 3.8% respectively. There were 25 (3.4%) isolates resistant to amphotericin-B. Although fluconazole usage increased over time (r(2) = 0.45; P = 0.07), fluconazole resistance did not increase accordingly (P = 0.33). In our institution in which the incidence of candidaemia was high, fluconazole resistance among blood Candida isolates remained rare."
21067023,"Aetiology, maternal and foetal outcome in 60 cases of obstetrical acute renal failure.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Acute renal failure is a serious complication in pregnancy. Not only does it result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality but also results in significant number of foetal loss. Although incidence of obstetrical acute renal failure has decreased in developed countries but still it is one of the major health problem of developing nations. The objective of this study was to study aetiology, maternal and foetal outcome in obstetrical acute renal failure. METHODS: This study was conducted at Department of Nephrology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar from August 2006 to December 2007. It was a descriptive, case series study. Female patients with pregnancy and acute renal failure, irrespective of age, were included in the study. Patients were thoroughly examined and baseline urea, creatinine, serum electrolytes, peripheral smear, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen degradation products, renal and obstetrical ultrasound were performed on each patient and 24-hr urinary protein and bacterial culture sensitivity on blood, urine or vaginal swabs were done in selected patients. Foetal and maternal outcome were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Mean age of the patients was 29 +/- 5.4 years and duration of gestation was 33 +/- 4.9 weeks. Mean gravidity was 4 +/- 2.2. Sixteen patients (26.66%) were treated conservatively while 44 (73.33%) required dialysis. Postpartum haemorrhage was present in 14 (23.33%), postpartum haemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in 11 (18.33%), eclampsia-preeclampsia in 8 (13.33%), antepartum haemorrhage in 8 (13.33%), antepartum haemorrhage with DIC in 6 (10%), DIC alone in 4 (6.66%), obstructed labour in 3 (5%), septic abortion in 3 (3.33%), HELLP (haemolysis elevated liver enzyme and low platelet) in 2 (3.33%), urinary tract infection with sepsis in 1 (1.66%) and puerperal sepsis in 1 (1.66%). Foetal loss was 40 (66.66%). Maternal mortality was 9 (15%) while 28 (46.66%) fully recovered. Among the rest 6 (30%) had partial recovery and 5 (8.33%) had dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Obstetrical acute renal failure not only results in foetal loss but also causes significant maternal morbidity and mortality."
15636451,Surgical treatment of infective endocarditis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the surgical indication in the treatment of infective endocarditis. SETTING: Retrospective study in a tertiary care--Wessex Cardiothoracic--Centre. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Case records of patients admitted with infective endocarditis for surgical treatment between 1984 to 1994 at Wessex Cardiothoracic Centre were analysed. This analysis includes the age, sex, microbiology results, risk factors, surgical indication and early results. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients was admitted with bacterial endocarditis treated surgically since 1984. The mean age was 51.9 years with male:female ratio of 3:1. The most common causative organism was streptococcus (63%) and staphylococcus (30%). Native valve endocarditis occurred in 111 patients, affecting the aortic, mitral, combined aortic and mitral valve in 69%, 33%, and 8% of cases, respectively. Late prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred in 12 patients. The most common indication for surgery was heart failure (84%), uncontrolled sepsis (8%), and recurrent endocarditis (2.5%). Hospital mortality was 1.6%. Complete heart block and cerebrovascular accident developed in 4% and 2.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure is the main indication for surgery. Valve replacement with mechanical prosthesis is a safe procedure with a low rate of mortality and complication."
32008527,Brain Volumes of very Low Birth Weight Infants Measured by Two-dimensional Cranial Ultrasonography: A Prospective Cohort Study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Cranial ultrasonography is the main neuroimaging technique for very low birth weight infants. Low brain volume is associated with poor neurologic outcome. This study aimed to calculate brain volumes of preterm infants with two-dimensional measurements of cranial ultrasonography. METHODS: Intracranial height, anteroposterior diameter, bi-parietal diamater, ventricular height, thalamo-occipital distance and ventricular index were measured with routine cranial ultrasonographic scanning. Brain considered a spheric, ellipsoid model and estimated brain volume (EBV) was calculated by subtracting two lateral ventricular volumes from the total brain volume. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one preterm infants under a birth weight of 1500 g and 32 weeks of gestational age were included in this study. The mean gestational age of study population was 27.7 weeks, and mean birthweight was 1057 grams. Twenty-two of 121 infants had dilated ventricle, in this group, EBV was lower than normal group (202 +/- 58 cm3 vs 250 +/- 53 cm3, respectively, p<0.01). Advanced resuscitation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and late-onset sepsis were found to be independent risk factors for low brain volume in our data. CONCLUSION: Estimated brain volume can be calculated by two-dimensional measurements with cranial ultrasonography."
32064083,Do we need to adopt antifungal stewardship programmes?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although antimicrobial stewardship programmes are one of the highest priorities in healthcare systems and many articles have been published, few refer to the implementation of antifungal stewardship and highlight specific points on which efforts should be focused. OBJECTIVE: To assess the percentage of patients with confirmed candidaemia in whom de-escalation was conducted, and the economic impact of step-down or step-up antifungal therapy. Additionally, we attempted to estimate the potential increase in drug minimum inhibitory concentrations or to detect resistant strains of Candida species. METHODS: We selected, retrospectively, patients who had received systemic antifungal therapy between 2011 and 2016 for documented candidaemia. Statistical analysis and diagrams were used to assess the results. RESULTS: Of 157 patients with confirmed candidaemia, 58 received azoles, 74 echinocandinsand 18 liposomal amphotericin B for empirical therapy. 51 patients were eligible to step-down to fluconazole but only 23 patients did so. Furthermore, in nine patients unjustified step-up from fluconazole to echinocandins or liposomal amphotericin B was carried out. The additional cost incurred bythe healthcare system due to high prices of echinocandins and liposomal amphotericin B in comparison with fluconazole waseuro211 837. Interestingly, it was found that one strain of C. albicans and two strains of C. glabrata were resistant to echinocandins. CONCLUSION: The presence of a multidisciplinary team, including an infection control specialist and a clinical pharmacist, would limit the prescription of advanced antifungal agents as empirical therapy. Moreover, this team would control the de-escalation process-where applicable-leading to a reduction in costs and, probably, a decrease in the emergence of resistant Candida species. These facts contribute to the broader discussion on the adoption of antifungal stewardship programmes."

20081281,"[Invasive pneumococcal disease in the Malopolska region of Poland, in the year 2002-2008. Is introduction of mass vaccination with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine justified?].",2009,"According to the WHO pneumococcal infections are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence of pneumococcal isolates belonging to serotypes covered by 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (7vPCV) isolated from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the Malopolska region of Poland in the years 2000-2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective clinical and microbiological analysis was performed on invasive, laboratory confirmed pneumococcal cases in the Malopolska region, between 2000-2008. RESULTS: During the study period there were 28 cases of IPD in children under 15 years of age in the Malopolska region. Most of the cases were diagnosed as meningitis, there were also cases of bacteraemic pneumonia and sepsis. The most common serotypes found during the study were: 14, 19F, 6B and 23F. Pneumococcal 7vPCV vaccine coverage among all cases was 78.0% and among children under 5 it was 94.0%. Nine isolates (32.1%) showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin. There were three fatal cases (CFR=10.7%) due to isolates of serotypes 19F, 23 F and 6B. In the six cases of meningitis, serious and lasting sequels were observed. All complicated and fatal cases as well as the cases caused by isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin were caused by serotypes covered by 7vPCV. CONCLUSIONS: The most serious cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in Malopolska region were caused by isolates of serotypes covered by 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. The results of this study prove the advantages of wide usage of the pneumococcal vaccine in the Polish population children."
15593044,Acute renal failure in a young woman with Fisher-Evans' syndrome.,2004,"A young female with Fisher-Evans' syndrome and a previous melanoma developed acute renal failure with generalized lymphoadenopathy and fever. The appearance of renal lesions is common in the course of several hematological disorders, but is unusual in Fisher-Evans' syndrome. Fisher-Evans' syndrome, defined as Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, is more frequently associated with the other autoimmune diseases, but not with renal involvement. In our case report, having excluded amyloidosis, myeloma, interstitial nephritis and sepsis, the rapid involvement of renal function with enlarged renal size seemed to suggest renal lymphoma. However, the lack of a monoclonal T-lymphocyte population in the renal tissue and peripheral blood, along with a clinical course characterized by a rapid reversibility of acute renal failure made this diagnosis rather an unlikely one. Polyclonal lymphocyte infiltration in a patient with a persistent autoimmune disease made us suspect a hyperimmune reaction. This syndrome is a non-neoplastic proliferation of B-cells involving an exaggeration of lymphocyte transformation. However, the clinical course is progressive and fatal, and can trigger a lymphoproliferative systemic disease. In our patient, two elements led us to suspect it was not a typical hyperimmune syndrome: first, polyclonal lymphocytes had massively infiltrated the kidney and, secondly, the clinical outcome was extremely favorable. Therefore, we were faced with an ""atypical"" and ""singular"" hyperimmune reaction with renal involvement, polyclonal proliferation of T-lymphocytes that had exhausted itself over time. Infective or toxic agents or drugs such as cyprofloxacin could have triggered the phenomenon, in the presence of a favorable condition such as Fisher-Evans' syndrome."
19931822,Diagnostic techniques in bloodstream infections: where are we going?,2009,"Rapid and early detection of bacteria in blood has an important role in the diagnosis of a febrile patient for at least three reasons: to establish the presence of an infection, to reassure the clinician about the chosen empirical therapy and to define antibiotic treatment after isolation of the microorganism and determination of its antibiotic susceptibility. We all agree that blood culture is the gold standard for aetiological diagnosis. However, it has limitations: the time required for bacteria to multiply to a detectable number of cells, the inadequate sensitivity of blood culture for fastidious pathogens and in patients who have previously received antibiotics, or when there is a catheter-related bloodstream infection. We must, however, remember that the current blood culture data constitute an important epidemiological tool on which clinicians can base empirical therapy. Over the past few years many new molecular tests have been developed that are now entering mainstream practice. These tests are more rapid, specific and sensitive; however, there are still some problems: antibiotic susceptibility testing is still lacking, and sometimes they are so sensitive that a skilled operator may be necessary for an accurate interpretation of the results. These new methods are promising, and their performance can only get better as they are increasingly used in clinical microbiological laboratories."
41413461,Therapeutic plasma exchange in severe postpartum HELLP syndrome: a promising treatment.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening obstetric complication marked by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia and potentially affecting multiple organ systems. While definitive treatment is typically achieved through delivery, in rare instances, both clinical and laboratory parameters may worsen in the postpartum period. In such critical cases, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) can serve as a potentially life-saving intervention. METHODS: This study analyzed the laboratory and clinical responses of 21 patients diagnosed with severe HELLP syndrome who underwent postpartum TPE between 2010 and 2023. RESULTS: Of the 21 patients, 14 (66.7%) were categorized as class 1 HELLP syndrome, and 7 (33.3%) as class 2. TPE was administered in a single session for 8 patients (38.1%), in two sessions for another 8 (38.1%), and in three sessions for the remaining 5 (23.8%). A significant increase in platelet count and significant decreases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels were observed when compared before and after TPE. Despite intervention, severe complications-including sepsis, pulmonary edema, renal failure, cerebrovascular events, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-developed in 9 patients (42.8%). One patient (4.8%) died due to multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TPE administered in the postpartum period can significantly improve clinical outcomes, hematological and biochemical derangements in patients with severe HELLP syndrome. Early initiation of TPE, ideally within 24-48 h following delivery in patients unresponsive to supportive care, is strongly recommended.

19940028,Noninvasive functional liver blood flow measurement: comparison between bolus dose and steady-state clearance of sorbitol in a small-rodent model.,2010,"Plasma clearance of D-sorbitol, a nontoxic polyol, occurs predominantly in the liver and has been used to measure functional liver blood flow after bolus and steady- state intravenous administration. However, it is not known which of these two administration methods is superior. Therefore, plasma D-sorbitol clearance was studied in an animal model both after a bolus dose and under steady-state (SS) conditions and compared directly with liver blood flow, under normal conditions, and after the induction of endotoxin (LPS) sepsis. Adult male Wistar rats (526 +/- 38 g body wt; n = 27) were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Hemodynamics, hepatic arterial flow, and portal venous flow were measured. Two groups were studied, namely healthy animals that served as controls and a sepsis group that received 5 mg/kg LPS intravenously (Escherichia coli O127:B8). Each animal received either a SS infusion (0.1 mg/100 g body wt per min) or a bolus (3 mg/100 g body wt) of a 5% D-sorbitol solution intravenously in a randomized order. After the initial measurements and a 60-min pause time in between (T(1/2,sorbitol) = 9 min), a crossover was done. The hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol in the control group showed a good correlation between bolus and SS (Spearman's r = 0.7681, P = 0.0004), and both techniques correlated well with total liver blood flow (TLBF) (r = 0.7239, P = 0.0023 and r = 0.7226, P = 0.0023, respectively). Also in the sepsis group there was a good correlation between bolus and SS sorbitol clearance (r = 0.6655, P = 0.0182). In the sepsis group, only the SS clearance correlated with TLBF (r = 0.6434, P = 0.024). In conclusion, in normal and under septic conditions, hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol either by bolus or a SS infusion is comparable. In healthy animals, this also correlated well with TLBF but not in septic conditions. However, this is expected because of the changes in the liver microcirculation, shunting, and decreased hepatocyte function in sepsis."
25657754,Medical closure of patent ductus arteriosus does not reduce mortality and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Although, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity due to hemodynamic instability in preterm infants, the effect of ductus closure on mortality and morbidity is a controversial issue. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of oral and intravenous (IV) ibuprofen treatment on ductal closure and effects on mortality and bronchoplumonary dysplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 292 premature infants treated at Ege University Neonatal Intensive Care Unit were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were classified into 3 groups as; No PDA, hemodynamically insignificant PDA (hiPDA) and hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) according to the presence and hemodynamical significance of PDA by echocardiography. hsPDA group was treated with IV or oral ibuprofen. RESULTS: Patent ductus arteriosus was diagnosed by routine echocardiography in 145 patients, of whom 78 (53.7%) had hsPDA. All 65 infants with hiPDA had spontaneous PDA closure. Echocardiographic measurements were similar to those patients treated with oral or IV ibuprofen, as in the response rate to treatment without serious adverse effects. The presence of respiratory distress syndrome, surfactant therapy, late sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with hsPDA. However, with stepwise logistic regression; 5(th) min Apgar score (odds ratio [OR], 1.321, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.063-1.641, P = 0.012) and gestational age (OR, 1.422, 95% CI, 1.212-1.662, P < 0.001) were the only significant variables associated with mortality. Gestational age (OR, 0.680, 95% CI, 0.531-0.871, P = 0.002) was the only significant variable associated with BPD shown with logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Ibuprofen treatment is effective for hsPDA closure with minimal side effects. HiPDA can close spontaneously; therefore treatment decision should be individualized. However, medical treatment of PDA does not reduce mortality and BPD."

25506564,Congenital candidiasis.,2014,"Congenital candidiasis (CC) is a rare disease with less than 100 cases being reported in the literature. It presents within six days of life with manifestations ranging from localized skin disease to systemic involvement in the form of respiratory distress, sepsis, and death. We report a neonate who presented with diffuse pustular eruption on erythematous background involving face, trunk, and palms within 24 h after birth. Candida albicans was identified in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear and culture from the pustules. Intravenous fluconazole and topical ketoconazole were given and the condition improved completely in two weeks. CC is rare and needs to be differentiated from other conditions presenting with pustular lesions at birth in order to avoid complications. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of this condition is important as untreated cases carry a mortality rate of 8-40%."
32069258,"Evaluation of biochemical, hematological, RIBA and PCR assays in predicting viremia in anti-HCV positive patients.",2019,"INTRODUCTION: The detection of HCV-RNA by PCR assays is considered to be the gold standard for confirming the presence of HCV viremia. However, high costs, long and laborious procedures limit their widespread usage. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the predictive performances of biochemical and hematological parameters, anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratios and RIBA assay for HCV viremia. METHODOLOGY: Medical records of 210 patients with positive anti-HCV results were analyzed. Samples were tested for anti-HCV by the Roche Elecsys assay. RIBA and PCR assays were performed with Inno-Lia HCV Score test, and Roche Cobas TaqMan HCV test, respectively. RESULTS: Anti-HCV positive patients were categorized into two groups: positive HCV-RNA(viremic) group (n = 94) and negative HCV-RNA(non-viremic) group (n = 116). All viremic patients had positive RIBA results, while in the non-viremic group, 80 (69%) patients had negative/indeterminate RIBA results and 36 (31%) patients had positive RIBA results. Compared with the non-viremic group, the viremic group had significantly higher alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width and anti-HCV levels, and significantly lower platelet count and plateletcrit levels (p < 0.05). With multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum ALT and anti-HCV levels were found to be strong predictive factors for HCV viremia. A S/CO ratio of >/= 12.34 was identified as the optimal anti-HCV level to predict viremia. CONCLUSIONS: An anti-HCV S/CO ratio of 12.34 can determine the necessity for PCR assay, when carefully evaluated together with the biochemical and hematological evidence. This approach may reduce the cost of diagnosis particularly in low-resource settings."
31841042,Calprotectin is superior to procalcitonin as a sepsis marker and predictor of 30-day mortality in intensive care patients.,2020,"Sepsis is the most frequent cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU). A rapid and correct diagnosis and initiation of therapy is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of calprotectin with the more widely used sepsis biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) in ICU patients. The performance of calprotectin and PCT as sepsis and prognostic markers for 30-d mortality was compared in a prospective, observational study in an eight-bed ICU. We investigated concentrations of the biomarkers in plasma collected at admission from all ICU patients admitted during a year (2012-2013, n = 271) together with simplified acute physiology 3 scores (SAPS3) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a higher area under the curve (AUC) value for calprotectin (0.79) than for PCT (0.49) when used as a sepsis marker. The calprotectin concentrations at admission were higher in non-survivors than in survivors at day 30. In our study, calprotectin was superior to PCT for distinguishing between ICU patients with sepsis and non-sepsis patients. Calprotectin also had higher predictive ability regarding 30-d mortality."
15724640,Indications for reoperation for valvular prosthesis dysfunction in urgent and elective patients.,2004,"OBJECTIVES: Comparison analysis of indications for operation, early clinical outcomes and hospital mortality between patients reoperated for valvular prosthesis dysfunction urgently and electively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of 94 patients (pts) reoperated for valve prosthesis dysfunction at Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology in Krakow, Poland between January 1999 and December 2002. RESULTS: Valvular reoperation was elective procedure in 69 pts (73.4%)--group A: 46 males (M), 23 females (F), age 23-71 (av. 51.31 +/- 10.2). Urgent operation was performed in 25 pts--group B: 17 M, 8 F, age 29-77 years (av. 5.41 +/- 13.26). In group B: 9 patients underwent reoperation for dysfunction of aortic valve (2 allogenic, 7 mechanical), 13 pts for mitral valve dysfunction and 3 pts for both aortic and mitral valve dysfunction. In group A: 24 pts for mitral valve dysfunction, 37 pts for aortic valve dysfunction (25 allogenic, 12 mechanical) and 8 pts for both aortic and mitral valve dysfunction. In group B: 16 pts (64%) were operated in NYHA class IV; 8 in cardiogenic shock; on which 8 pts with active endocarditis, 3 pts with sepsis and 1 patient in septic shock. Average operative risk calculated as Euroscore was 30.86 in group B and 13.15 in group A (p<0.05). Overall hospital mortality was 12.6% (12 pts). In group B: 7 pts died (28%), 3 pts due to multiorgan failure, 1 patient due to sepsis, 2 pts due to aorta rupture and 1 due to left ventricle rupture during cardiopulmonary rescuscitation. In group B 5 pts died (7.2%). CONCLUSION: Patients reoperated urgently for valve prosthesis dysfunction were in worse preoperative state, had significantly higher preoperative risk and in hospital mortality than patients reoperated electively."
32002083,Sepsis in Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults with Diabetic Ketoacidosis: A Case Report.,2019,"BACKGROUND: This case report intends to highlight the challenge in diagnosing type 1 diabetes on an adult patient. Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adult (LADA) types I diabetes Mellitus, which found in adulthood and characterised by progressive damage to pancreatic beta cells that happened slowly. Incidence of LADA is around 2-12% of the total diabetes population. Sepsis in LADA patients will trigger diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 33-year-old woman patient presents with decreased consciousness accompanied by rapid and deep breathlessness for 1 day. Before, the patient complains of fever and cough. Physical examination found soporous, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 110 x/minute, temperature 38.8 degrees C, breathing 32 x/minute Kussmaul. Bronchovesicular breath crackles in both lower lung fields. leukocytes were 22,100/mm(3), random blood glucose 638 mg/dL, urine ketone +++, HbA1C 17.2%, HOMA IR less than 2 units. C-peptide 0.3 ng/mL and GADAs 16.9 U/mL. Chest Xray indicated bronchopneumonia. Patients were diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, LADA, and sepsis caused by bronchopneumonia. Patient treated with DKA management and sepsis. On the second day, the treatment of DKA was resolved and continued with the administration of short-acting insulin and regular long-acting. CONCLUSION: Sepsis in LADA with DKA requires fast and appropriate management. Further search is needed to diagnose LADA."
31828354,The evaluation of early predictive factors for urosepsis in patients with negative preoperative urine culture following mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,2020,"PURPOSE: To identify early predictive factors for urosepsis secondary to mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) in patients with negative preoperative urine culture (UC). METHODS: A total of 786 patients with baseline negative UC who underwent MPCNL between January 2017 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Urosepsis was defined according to the Sepsis-3 definition. Subsequently, perioperative potential risk factors were compared between non-urosepsis and urosepsis groups. RESULTS: Despite negative UC in all patients, the rate of positive stone culture (SC) was 16.0%; the rate of pelvic urine culture (PUC) was 7.5%; 23 cases (2.9%) developed urosepsis after MPCNL. Univariate analysis showed that urosepsis was associated with the female gender, BMI, stone burden, diabetes mellitus and preoperative urine test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that urine test with positive nitrite and white blood cells and leukocyte esterase (N+WBC+LE+) (OR 17.51, 95% CI 6.75-45.38, P < 0.001) and operative time > 120 min (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.41-8.85, P = 0.007) were independent risk factors for urosepsis. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of N+WBC+LE+ showed that the area under the curve was 0.785 for predicting the occurrence of urosepsis. Further analysis showed that N+WBC+LE+ provided an efficient prediction of SC+/PUC+ (SC+ or PUC+) with 61.7% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the baseline negative preoperative UC, 2.9% of patients developed urosepsis after MPCNL. N+WBC+LE + was determined to be an early and efficient prediction of intraoperative bacterial status and urosepsis following MPCNL. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm the results."
15578362,Prevention of peritransplantation viridans streptococcal bacteremia with early vancomycin administration: a single-center observational cohort study.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Viridans streptococcal bacteremia (VSB) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with substantial mortality. Prevention of this serious complication is therefore a high priority. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of early vancomycin administration on rates and outcomes of VSB. METHODS: We analyzed the effect of early vancomycin on the incidence of VSB in a cohort of 430 consecutive HSCTs performed during the period of 1 January 1998 to 30 September 2002. The primary end point was time to diagnosis of VSB. Early vancomycin was defined as >or=2 doses of vancomycin between days -7 through +7 after HSCT or diagnosis of VSB, whichever occurred first. Risk factors for VSB were identified in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The incidence of VSB in the cohort was 7.4%. The incidence of VSB in patients who did not receive early vancomycin was 24.8%, compared with 0.3% in patients who did (P<.001). Additional risk factors were female sex, conditioning with total body irradiation, and diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The attributable mortality rate for VSB in our cohort was 21%. Early vancomycin was associated with decreased VSB (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.19) after controlling for age, sex, underlying disease, and transplantation variables. The benefits of vancomycin prophylaxis for the prevention of VSB and associated mortality need to be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial."
41615731,Prognostic Value and Potential Mechanism of CD8+ T Subsets Phenotype in ICU Patients with Sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: While CD8+ T-cell subsets play a crucial role in sepsis prognosis, the prognostic value of their dynamic changes and molecular mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Compared to static single-timepoint measurements, the prognostic role of repeated measurements over time remains undetermined. METHODS: The study included 220 intensive care unit patients with sepsis (2023.08-2024.05). K-means clustering analysis based on CD8+CD28+/CD8+%, CD8+CD38+/CD8+%, and CD8+DR+/CD8+% was used to categorize patients into two groups. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for 28-day mortality prediction. Fifteen patients from each group were selected for Olink proteomics analysis to investigate differentially expressed proteins and conduct functional enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Using K-means clustering analysis based on CD8+ T-cell subset phenotypes, patients were divided into group 1 (n = 74) and group 2 (n = 146), with group 2 demonstrating significantly higher 28-day mortality compared to group 1 (32.3% vs. 17.6%, P < 0.001). Further dynamic trend analysis revealed that patients exhibiting continuously decreasing CD8+CD28+/CD8+% and increasing CD8+CD38+/CD8+% had the poorest prognosis, with a 28-day mortality rate of 50%. The combined measurement of CD8+CD28+/CD8+% and CD8+CD38+/CD8+% showed enhanced prognostic value (area under the curve = 0.676) compared to individual measurements, indicating the importance of monitoring multiple T-cell subset markers. Additionally, Olink proteomic analysis identified IL-12Rbeta1 as a key molecular mediator closely associated with CD8+ T-cell function and activation subsets, providing insights into the underlying mechanism of immune dysfunction in sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD8+ T-cell subset phenotypes serve as important prognostic indicators in sepsis, with IL-12Rbeta1 potentially being a key molecule affecting CD8+ T-cell function, providing a new potential target for sepsis monitoring and immunotherapy."
31808441,[A sepsis that you don't expect... Lemierre's syndrome. Description of a clinical case.].,2019,"A healthy 16-year-old boy was hospitalized for fever, septic condition and thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein: The diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome (LS) with positive blood culture for Fusobacterium necrophorum was formalized. He was treated with antibiotics and anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin with complete recovery. Four weeks after discharge, the jugular vein ecodoppler showed complete resolution of the thrombosis. LS is characterized by thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and anaerobic bacteremia often caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. It is a rare disease in the post-antibiotic era, but with an increase in cases over the last twenty years. LS should be suspected in young, healthy patients with persistent pharyngitis followed by sepsis, pneumonia or atypical laterocervical pain. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of jugular venous thrombosis and is further confirmed by the growth of anaerobic bacteria on blood culture. Prolonged antibiotic and anticoagulant therapies are the essential elements of treatment. However, anticoagulant therapy for internal venous thrombosis associated with LS remains a controversy."
41503120,Case Report: A Painful Twist of Fate Due to Intra-abdominal Textiloma.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. CONCLUSION: Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes."
31814044,Effect of magnesium supplementation on lactate clearance in critically ill patients with severe sepsis: a randomized clinical trial.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, changes in lactate clearance following magnesium supplementation were evaluated in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive either magnesium (n = 30) or placebo (n = 28). Patients in the magnesium group received intravenous magnesium sulfate to maintain serum magnesium level around 3 mg/dL for 3 days. The placebo group received the same volume of normal saline. Change in lactate clearance was considered primary outcome of the study. RESULTS: Mean increase in the lactate clearance in the magnesium group was significantly higher than the placebo group on day 2 (27.53% vs. 23.79% respectively, p < 0.001) and day 3 (49.83% vs. 37.02% respectively, p < 0.001). Time to lactate clearance was also significantly shorter in the magnesium group than the placebo group (47.28 +/- 20.59 vs. 61.20 +/- 24.31 h respectively, p = 0.03). Sepsis-related mortality was not significantly different but median length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the magnesium group than the placebo group (8 vs. 15 days respectively, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium supplementation increased lactate clearance in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. Optimizing serum magnesium level near the upper limit of the normal range may improve severe sepsis outcomes."
15690699,[Analysis of the acid glycoprotein heterogeneity in patients with arthritis].,2004,"The concentration measurement of the acute phase proteins in blood serum has been applied in differential diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis since a long time. However, it appeared that the qualitative changes such as the presence of different glycoforms of the acute phase protein that was a glycoprotein, enabled to differentiate acute inflammatory conditions including the chronic ones, and to determine the dynamics of inflammatory process. This phenomenon is defined as a main heterogeneity, whereas the determination of the proportions of particular glycoforms is known as glycosylation profile. The changes of this profile are well known in the course of acute inflammatory conditions such as: bacterial sepsis, skin burns complicated with bacterial infections or acute pancreatitis. Considerably less observations concern the chronic conditions as: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and degenerative joint disease. The examination encompassed 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 21 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 19 with reactive arthritis and 21 patients with degenerative joint disease whose diagnosis was established on the basis of international diagnostic criteria. In all these patient the changes of C-reactive protein (CRP), acid glycoprotein (AGP) as well as glycosylation profile of the AGP were evaluated. For this purpose the electrophoresis method of two affinity directions with concanavalin A was applied, whereas the concentration of particular acute phase protein was determined by Laurell's immunoelectrophoresis method. The variants of glycoprotein resulted from electrophoresis were calculated with aid of planimetric method, and the results were presented as a coefficient of glycosylation. The characteristic patterns of glycosylation profile in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis may be useful in differential diagnosis of the above mentioned diseases."

31899078,Verification of blood volume for blood culture and detection rate in pediatrics.,2020,"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to estimate the blood culture volume that should be collected from pediatric patients to improve diagnostic abilities. METHODS: Blood cultures from neonates and children aged up to 18 years were collected and the volume was measured for over a 1-year period. During the intervention period, examiners were instructed to draw 3 mL of blood for culture, if possible. The pre-intervention period was from June 1 to August 31, 2016. The post-intervention period was from September 1, 2016, to May 30, 2017. The rate of positive detections was calculated and compared between pre and post-intervention periods. RESULTS: We collected 1352 samples and measured 1327 bottles. During the pre-intervention period, 340 cases were collected with a median blood volume of 1.64 mL; 9 cases (2.7%) were true-positive. During the intervention period, 1012 cases were ordered with a median blood volume of 2.41 mL; 19 cases (1.9%) were true-positive. After intervention, blood volume was increased significantly (p < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the rate of positive detections during the study periods (p = 0.254). CONCLUSIONS: In the pediatric clinical setting in a Japanese municipal hospital, the positive detection rate did not improve even when the collected blood volume was increased. One milliliter of blood volume may be adequate for the pediatric bottle in children."
20046118,Sepsis-associated encephalopathy and its differential diagnosis.,2009,"Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, which is associated with increased mortality and is consistent with delirium but can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased in biomarkers of brain injury (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, S-100 beta-protein) and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination that can lead one to perform specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis. Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, at the same time avoiding neurotoxic drugs."
25814111,Essentials of sepsis management.,2015,"Despite remarkable advances in the knowledge of infection and human response to it, sepsis continues to be one of the most common challenges surgeons and critical care providers face. Surgeons confront the problem of infection every day, in treating established infections or reacting to a consequence of surgical intervention. Infections after surgery continue to be a problem despite massive efforts to prevent them. Patients rely on the surgeon's ability to recognize infection and treat it. Also, preventing nosocomial infection and antibiotic resistance is a primary responsibility. This article describes diagnostic and therapeutic measures for sepsis in the perioperative surgical patient."

15576798,Large-scale identification of genes required for full virulence of Staphylococcus aureus.,2004,"Gene products required for in vivo growth and survival of microbial pathogens comprise a unique functional class and may represent new targets for antimicrobial chemotherapy, vaccine construction, or diagnostics. Although some factors governing Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity have been identified and studied, a comprehensive genomic analysis of virulence functions will be a prerequisite for developing a global understanding of interactions between this pathogen and its human host. In this study, we describe a genetic screening strategy and demonstrate its use in screening a collection of 6,300 S. aureus insertion mutants for virulence attenuation in a murine model of systemic infection. Ninety-five attenuated mutants were identified, reassembled into new pools, and rescreened using the same murine model. This effort identified 24 highly attenuated mutants, each of which was further characterized for virulence attenuation in vivo and for growth phenotypes in vitro. Mutants were recovered in numbers up to 1,200-fold less than wild type in the spleens of systemically infected animals and up to 4,000-fold less than wild type in localized abscess infections. Genetic analysis of the mutants identified insertions in 23 unique genes. The largest gene classes represented by these mutants encoded enzymes involved in small-molecule biosynthesis and cell surface transmembrane proteins involved in small-molecule binding and transport. Additionally, three insertions defined two histidine kinase sensor-response regulator gene pairs important for S. aureus in vivo survival. Our findings extend the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms employed by S. aureus to ensure its successful growth and survival in vivo. Many of the gene products we have identified represent attractive new targets for antibacterial chemotherapy."
18470722,The natural elimination rate of procalcitonin in patients with normal and impaired renal function.,2000,"OBJECTIVE: Procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations and its kinetic can be used as a diagnostic tool in critically ill patients and patients with sepsis. Since renal dysfunction is a frequent complication in these patients, and PCT is a protein with a low molecular weight, we have measured the half-life time of PCT after peak concentrations in patients with normal and impaired renal function. We also have analyzed the influence of patients age and gender on PCT elimination kinetics. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. Renal dysfunction was assessed by plasma creatinine. The half-life time of PCT was evaluated 24 and 48 h after acute induction of PCT, when the focus of PCT induction has rapidly been eliminated. SETTING: Intensive care unit of our University hospital, a tertiary health care institution. PATIENTS: 69 patients were included into the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The half-life-time of PCT was not significantly altered during renal dysfunction (26.1-33.1 h, 25-50 percentiles, creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) when compared with normal renal function (22.3-28.9 h). It neither correlated with creatinine clearance (p=0.14), nor age (p=0.99) or gender (p=0.90, Pearson product-moment correlation). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present study demonstrate that assessment of PCT kinetic can also be used for diagnostic and prognostic reasons in patients with renal dysfunction. It may, however, exceed 24 h also in patients with normal renal function. As to the present knowledge, renal secretion does not contribute as a main pathway to PCT elimination."
20168072,[Cryptococcemia with a severe bronchial asthma: case report and review of the literature].,2009,"A 64-year old hospitalized male for severe bronchial asthma began to complain fatigue and appetite loss. His asthma had been treated with oral bethamethasone. The Chest CT at this time revealed a bilateral consolidation of the lower lung. Despite a week of treatment with antibiotics and anti-fungals, the patient expired from DIC progression. His premortem sputum and blood culture grew Cryptococcus Neoformans. We concluded his diagnosis as cryptococcal pneumonia and sepsis. Sepsis by Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare clinical event, and only 20 cases have been reported in Japan. Although 16 of the 20 had preexisting medical conditions, a case with underlying bronchial asthma has never been reported. A comparison of the reported cases of the US and Europe to that of Japan revealed differences in the patients' underlying conditions. We report a case with a brief review of the literature and summarize the 20 cases that have been reported in Japan."
41433510,Incidence and factors associated with rapid blood culture sterilization among patients receiving ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia.,2026,"Ertapenem combination therapy has been shown to expedite the time to blood culture sterilization among patients with MSSA bacteremia. The purpose of this study was to define what proportion of patients sterilizes blood cultures within 72 h of ertapenem combination treatment initiation. This was a retrospective, multicenter study of patients who received ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia. Patients were considered to have rapid blood culture sterilization if blood cultures were negative within 72 h of ertapenem initiation and delayed blood culture sterilization if blood cultures remained positive after 72 h of ertapenem initiation. Of the 304 patients with MSSA bacteremia who received ertapenem for combination treatment, 197 met the inclusion criteria. The median (IQR) time to ertapenem initiation from the time of blood culture obtainment was 4 (3-5) days, and 47% (93/197) had definitive endocarditis. Overall, 85% (167/197) had rapid blood culture sterilization. Patients who had delayed blood culture sterilization had a trend toward a higher Pitt Bacteremia Score at the time of blood culture obtainment (2 [0-4] vs 1 [0-2], P = 0.091) and were more likely to have an oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration of >/=0.5 microg/mL (67% vs 43%, P = 0.015) compared to those with rapid blood culture sterilization. In this large study of patients who received ertapenem combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia, 85% of patients sterilized their blood cultures within 72 h of treatment. These results suggest that a standard 3-day ertapenem course could be a reasonable stewardship strategy for patients initiated on combination therapy for MSSA bacteremia."
25540572,Sclerosing peritonitis with unilateral ovarian luteinized thecoma in a post-menopausal woman: A case report.,2014,"A unique case of unilateral ovarian luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis is reported because the association between these two conditions is extremely rare. Etiology is not clearly known. A 50-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with pain abdomen and huge swelling. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed a heterogenous enhancing mass arising possibly from ovary and adherent to uterus, bowl loops, and omentum. A spindle cell neoplasm without definite features of malignancy was reported in computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Ascitic fluid was negative for malignancy. Her serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (1.1ng/ml) and CA125 (27.6mu/ml) level was within normal limits. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral supracolic omentectomy, resection of part of colon, and supracolic omentectomy was done. Histopathological diagnosis was luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis. Tumor cells were immunoreactive to smooth muscle antigen (SMA) and CD 99 and non- reactive to ER, PR, Calretinine, and Cytokeratin. Patient developed post-operative sepsis and enterocutaneous fistula, which was managed conservatively and was kept in follow-up. According to current concept, in spite of its large size, wide-spread involvement, mitotic activity, and complications due to peritoneal involvement, behavior of this rare clinical entity is benign."
31806943,30-Day Potentially Preventable Hospital Readmissions In Older Patients: Clinical Phenotype And Health Care Related Risk Factors.,2019,"PURPOSE: Early readmission rate has been regarded as an indicator of in-hospital and post-discharge quality of care. Evaluating the contributing factors is crucial to optimize the healthcare and target the intervention. In this study we evaluated the potential for preventing 30-day hospital readmission in a cohort of older patients and identified possible risk factors for readmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes of patients consecutively hospitalized for acute disease in the Geriatrics Unit of the University Hospital of Pisa within a 1-year window were recorded. All the patients had received a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Crossing and elaboration of the DRG codes was performed by the Potentially Preventable Readmission Grouping software (3M() Corporation). DRG codes were classified as stand-alone admissions (SA), index admissions (IA) and potentially preventable readmissions (PPR) within a time window of 30 days after discharge. RESULTS: In total, 1263 SA and 171 IA were identified, with an overall PPR rate of 11.9%. Hospitalizations were significantly longer in IA and PPR than SA (p<0.05). The more frequent readmission causes were acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, sepsis, pneumonia and stroke. In acute heart failure a nonlinear U-shaped readmission trend (with nadir at 5 days of hospitalization) was observed while, in all the other DRG codes, the PPR rate increased with increasing length of hospitalization. Comprehensive geriatric assessment showed a significantly lower degree of disability and comorbidity in SA than IA patients. At stepwise regression analysis, a high degree of disability and comorbidity as well as the diagnosis of sepsis emerged as independent risk factors for PPR. CONCLUSION: Addressing PPR is crucial, especially in older patients. The adequacy of treatment during hospitalization (especially in cases of sepsis) as well as the setting of a comprehensive discharge plan, accounting for comorbidity and disability of the patients, are essential to reduce PPR."
24741715,SERAC1 Deficiency.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The phenotypic spectrum of SERAC1 deficiency comprises MEGD(H)EL syndrome (3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness-dystonia, [hepatopathy], encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome), juvenile-onset complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (in 1 consanguineous family), and adult-onset generalized dystonia (in 1 adult male). MEGD(H)EL syndrome is characterized in neonates by hypoglycemia and a sepsis-like clinical picture for which no infectious agent can be found. During the first year of life feeding problems, failure to thrive, and/or truncal hypotonia become evident; many infants experience (transient) liver involvement ranging from undulating transaminases to prolonged hyperbilirubinemia and near-fatal liver failure. By age two years progressive deafness, dystonia, and spasticity prevent further psychomotor development and/or result in loss of acquired skills. Affected children are completely dependent on care for all activities of daily living; speech is absent. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SERAC1 deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and metabolic (3-methylglutaconic aciduria) findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SERAC1 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of MEGD(H)EL syndrome is supportive. Care is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including a metabolic pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, dietician, and physical therapist when possible. Some individuals have experienced (temporary) improvement of spasticity with oral or intrathecal baclofen treatment. Respiratory problems resulting from excessive drooling improve with botulinum toxin injection in the salivary glands, extirpation of salivary glands, and/or rerouting of glandular ducts. An age-appropriate diet given via nasogastric tube or gastrostomy can greatly improve overall clinical condition. Surveillance: Neurologic and orthopedic evaluations as needed based on individual findings are appropriate. GENETIC COUNSELING: SERAC1 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SERAC1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."
20036093,Fistula formation to the bladder and to a corpus alienum as a rare complication of diverticulitis: a case report.,2012,"BACKGROUND: Fistula formation is a known complication of diverticulitis. Treatment of a diverticular fistula depends on the comorbidity of the patient and the severity of the disease. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with chronic lower back pain that was being treated with a neurostimulator. He presented with severe sepsis, and an abscess formation near the neurostimulator. An abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan revealed diverticulitis complicated by fistula formation to the neurostimulator and bladder. He was successfully treated by a two-stage procedure: first, exploration and drainage of the abscess, with removal of the foreign body, followed by a sigmoid resection 1 week later. CONCLUSION: In rare but severe presentations of diverticular disease, it is very important to limit initial treatment to the most threatening disorder."
16573481,Iodine induced thyrotoxicosis following povidine-iodine dressings: a case report.,2003,"A 40-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit after a radical resection of a recurrent abdominal malignancy. Her postoperative course was complicated by sepsis requiring numerous abdominal operations with the abdomen being left open for drainage and dressings. Use of povidone-iodine soaked abdominal packs to reduce secondary infection led to development of thyrotoxicosis, which resolved following the cessation of the iodine dressings. A high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of this condition in intensive care patients as the usual haemodynamic signs of thyrotoxicosis may be misinterpreted as being caused by sepsis."
41399305,Diagnostic accuracy and safety of image-guided transperineal versus transrectal prostate biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the diagnostic performance and complication profiles of transperineal biopsy (TPBx) versus transrectal biopsy (TRBx) for prostate cancer, incorporating recent randomized and large observational studies. METHODS: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched till April 2025. Studies directly comparing TPBx and TRBx were included. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2.0 for randomized trials and the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and a GRADE assessment were performed to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (n = 90,621) were included. TPBx showed higher PCa detection (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02) and csPCa detection (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.24; p = 0.001), though the certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Heterogeneity was moderate to high. TPBx also showed lower infection-related complications and comparable overall events, though procedure-related pain was slightly higher. CONCLUSION: TPBx offers improved diagnostic yield and lower infection risk compared with TRBx, with comparable safety. However, given the moderate heterogeneity and limited high-quality RCTs, further confirmatory trials are necessary. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO identifier is CRD420251035763."
41557542,Mortality and associated factors in post-stem cell transplant patients: a two-year cohort in a public hospital in Peru.,2025,"OBJECTIVE. To determine mortality and associated factors in patients who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, between January 2017 and December 2022. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 2017 and 2022. Death at one hundred days and two years, and its associated factors, were evaluated. Proportional Cox regression models were used. RESULTS. 342 post-HSCT patients were included, with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range: 10 to 39), of whom 53.5% were women. The most frequent diagnosis for the transplant was acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 54.1%. Mortality in the first 100 days post-HSCT was 8.2%, and at two years was 30.4%. In the multivariate regression at one hundred days, factors associated with a higher risk of mortality were age over 50 years (HRa: 6.97; 95% CI: 1.18-41.23), being a recipient of a haploidentical transplant (HRa: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.13-11.24), and sepsis as a complication (HRa: 68.78; 95% CI: 19.32-244.84). In the two-year analysis, acute myeloid leukemia (1.72; IC 95%: 1.08-2.74), haploidentical transplant (HRa:1.81; 95%CI: 1.21-2.72), and disease relapse (HRa: 4.17; 95%CI%: 2.75-6.31) were associated with a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS. The mortality found was low and similar to that of countries with higher incomes; however, it is necessary to formulate interventions that reduce the incidence of modifiable factors such as sepsis."
15599149,Assessment of preemptive treatment to prevent severe candidiasis in critically ill surgical patients.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a preemptive antifungal therapy in preventing proven candidiasis in critically ill surgical patients. DESIGN: Before/after intervention study, with 2-yr prospective and 2-yr historical control cohorts. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine hundred and thirty-three patients, 478 in the prospective group and 455 in the control group, with SICU stay > or =5 days. INTERVENTIONS: During the prospective period, systematic mycological screening was performed on all patients admitted to the SICU, immediately at admittance and then weekly until discharge. A corrected colonization index was used to assess intensity of Candida mucosal colonization. Patients with corrected colonization index > or =0.4 received early preemptive antifungal therapy (fluconazole intravenously: loading dose 800 mg, then 400 mg/day for 2 wks). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: End points of this study were the frequency of proven candidiasis, especially SICU-acquired candidiasis. During the retrospective period, 32 patients of 455 (7%) presented with proven candidiasis: 22 (4.8%) were imported and 10 (2.2%) were SICU-acquired cases. During the prospective period, 96 patients with corrected colonization index > or =0.4 of 478 received preemptive antifungal treatment and only 18 cases (3.8%) of proven candidiasis were diagnosed; all were imported infections. Candida infections occurred more frequently in the control cohort (7% vs. 3.8%; p = .03). Incidence of SICU-acquired proven candidiasis significantly decreased from 2.2% to 0% (p < .001, Fisher test). Incidence of proven imported candidiasis remained unchanged (4.8% vs. 3.8%; p = .42). No emergence of azole-resistant Candida species (especially Candida glabrata, Candida krusei) was noted during the prospective period. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted preemptive strategy may efficiently prevent acquisition of proven candidiasis in SICU patients. Further studies are being performed to assess cost-effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on selection of azole-resistant Candida strains on a long-term basis."
32110528,Case of internal jugular vein thrombosis and fever: Lemierre's syndrome or Trousseau's syndrome?,2020,"Internal jugular vein thrombosis is a rare critical cardiovascular emergency, which has potential catastrophic clinical outcomes by resulting in stroke and pulmonary embolism. Several etiologies have been reported; however, there are limited data on Lemierre's and Trousseau's syndromes, which are both rare conditions with advanced disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Lemierre's syndrome may present with typical progressively infectious symptoms and signs, including sore throat, neck mass, and fever, whereas Trousseau's syndrome may present with thrombophlebitis and painful edema. Without antibiotic agents controlling the infection, the condition of patients with Lemierre's syndrome may progress to sepsis or septic shock. The infection pattern plays an important role for differential diagnosis. Herein, we describe the case of a 46-year-old woman presenting with atypical symptoms of Trousseau's syndrome mimicking Lemierre's syndrome. Laboratory analysis including protein C, protein S, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody ruled out hypercoagulopathy and autoimmune vasculitis. Abdominal computed tomography and panendoscopy revealed ulcerative tumor at the antrum. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma. We highlight the clinical features and etiologies of internal jugular vein thrombosis, especially in Lemierre's syndrome and Trousseau's syndrome, to aid physicians in making an early diagnosis and providing timely management."
15729019,[Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia: description of a new case].,2004,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is an only recently recognised syndrome. We present a case whereby a month after an episode of fever, a 17-year-old boy was recovered with liver enzyme elevation and circulating platelet reduction. All the acute viral hepatitis markers were negative. After bone marrow aspiration a severe aplastic anemia was diagnosed and all the findings were consistent with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. The disorder was initially treated with glucocorticoids and platelet transfusion, obtaining the normalization of the liver enzymes but worsening of the aplastic anemia. An HLA-identical related marrow donor was not found. The patient responded to immunosuppressive treatment but died of multi-organ failure due to severe sepsis."
15666255,Infections and severe sepsis in solid-organ transplant patients admitted from a university-based ED.,2004,"The objective was to provide a descriptive analysis of infectious processes in transplant patients admitted from the emergency department (ED). A database of all adult transplant patients at a university medical center was cross-referenced with a computerized record of all ED visits over an 18-month period. ED charts, inpatient records, and microbiology data were retrospectively reviewed. Final diagnoses and outcomes were analyzed. There were 352 ED visits by transplant patients (kidney 66%, kidney/pancreas 15%, liver 13%, lung 3%, heart 3%). Infections were the most common indications for admission (77/217, 35%). Urinary tract infection and pneumonia were the most common infections. Nine of 77 patients (11.7%) with documented infections developed severe sepsis, which was the most common reason for ICU utilization. Thirty-five percent of transplant patients admitted from the ED had acute infections, and 11.7% of these patients had severe sepsis. The emergency physician must have a high index of suspicion for infections when evaluating organ transplant recipients."
16163464,Experimental confirmation of Serratia marcescens contamination in multiple-dose vials of heparin-saline solution.,2004,"The initial contamination of heparin-saline solution (HS) in multiple-dose vials (MDVs) by Serratia marcescens was experimentally investigated using various isolates. Isolates I2 and S1 were from blood specimens from patients with a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). Isolates I13 and FHSM9043 were from urine and blood specimens, respectively, from patients without HAI. Isolate I124, with a pulsed-field get electrophoresis pattern identical to that of isolate I2, was from the hospital environment. Viable cells of isolate I2 were carried over into the HS of MDVs when the contaminated rubber septum was pierced with a syringe needle. When the outside surface of the septum was contaminated by inoculating it with wet-cell suspensions in HS or Muller-Hinton broth, the viable cells carried over were detected at a minimum inoculum size (MIS) of 10(3) s cfu/ml. However, when the surface was contaminated by inoculating it with dry-cell suspensions, the viable cells carried over were detected at an MIS of 10(7) s cfu/ml. The viable cells in the internal lumen of the needle much more than those on its outside surface spread to the HS of MDVs. For exposures of 24 h and 72 h at 4 degrees C to HS with 1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative in MDVs, viable cells of all isolates tested were detected at MIS values of 1 s and 10 s cfu/ml, respectively, increases three orders of magnitude smaller than those of reference strain IFO3736. These results suggest that S. marcescens isolates are readily carried over into the HS of MDVs by piercing a wet, contaminated rubber septum with a syringe needle. Also, despite the sterilization action of 1% benzyl alcohol, the organism persistently survived at 4 degrees C, even when initial contamination was with a small amount of inoculum."
31812215,The Prognostic Value of Endotoxemia and Intestinal Barrier Biomarker ZO-1 in Bacteremic Sepsis.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal barrier dysfunction exerts a pivotal pathophysiological role in the development of multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential role of serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) levels as biomarkers of intestinal barrier dysfunction in bacteremic sepsis. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with bacteremic sepsis of abdominal origin (n = 34) or nonabdominal origin (n = 41) and 12 healthy controls were retrospectively studied. Blood samples collected upon sepsis diagnosis were analyzed for serum ZO-1, I-FABP and endotoxin levels. Prognostic scores Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), quickSOFA and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) were determined over the first 24 hours after sepsis diagnosis and patients' outcome in terms of 28-day mortality was recorded. RESULTS: Serum ZO-1 levels were significantly higher in bacteremic septic patients as compared to controls with no difference between patients with abdominal or extra-abdominal source of infection. Serum I-FABP levels were significantly lower in septic patients as compared to control and this reduction was more evident in patients with bacteremic abdominal sepsis. Serum ZO-1 and endotoxin concentrations were found significantly higher in patients who did not survive from sepsis. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, both endotoxin and ZO-1 predicted 28-day mortality. In addition, ZO-1 and endotoxin were correlated with the prognostic scores of qSOFA, SOFA and APACHE II. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that serum ZO-1 might be a reliable biomarker of gut barrier dysfunction in sepsis, not affected by the abdominal or extra-abdominal site of infection. ZO-1, measured early at sepsis diagnosis, might represent a valuable additional prognostic tool for patients' outcome."
31843286,The role of concomitant alcohol and drug use in increased risk for burn mortality outcomes.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Burn injuries are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, with high rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. The risks may be heightened for persons who present with concomitant use of alcohol and illicit substances, which increase the risk for injury and severely compromise prognosis following injury. METHODS: This study utilised a national dataset on hospitalised burns in South Africa to explore the risk for mortality relative to morbidity. To assess the influence of alcohol and drugs in mortality outcomes, the analysis was restricted to adult cases, 18 years and older (N = 918). The primary statistical procedures used in the analysis were logistic regression models. FINDINGS: The results indicate that burn victims with full thickness and partial thickness burn degree and more than 30% TBSA had a significantly increased risk of mortality. In addition, the risk for mortality was increased ten times when concomitant alcohol and drugs were indicated compared to cases where these were absent. The length of stay in hospital diminished the risk for mortality by about 10%. INTERPRETATION: The findings may be explained by the role of skin as the main barrier against infections and the concurrent increase in risk of infection based on the degree and extent of any damage. The combined presence of both alcohol and drugs may predispose towards more severe burns and greatly compromise liver function with heightened risk for sepsis and death."
20575312,Intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria to prevent low birth weight in newborns in a cohort of pregnant women from a malaria endemic area.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To determine and describe the patterns of low birth weight in newborns of a cohort of mothers given intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) for malaria prevention in a malaria endemic area of Kenya. DESIGN: A longitudinal prospective cohort study. SETTING: Got Agulu Health Centre in Usigu Division, Bondo District, Nyanza Province. SUBJECTS: Pregnant women of all parities attending antenatal care services. Only women who gave informed consent for themselves and their newborns after birth were eligible to participate in the study. RESULTS: Parity was highly predictive of birth weight in the study subjects. Primigravidae and secondigravidae had a significantly lower mean birth weight (2952g) than women of higher gravidity (3214g) p-value <0.0001. Regardless of IPT administration, women who became positive for malaria infection at any point during pregnancy delivered 73.7% of the LBW infants. There was no significant difference in mean birth weights between primigravidae and multigravidae who had parasitaemia at baseline and at delivery (means 2906g and 3062g respectively, p=0.11). However, there was a significant difference between the parasitaemia negative primigravidae and multigravidae at baseline and at delivery (means 2952g and 3204g respectively, p=0.006). Infection with helminths did not have an effect on birth weight. Overall, low birth weight was observed in 9% of the newborns and was most commonly found in primigravidae and secondigravidae (14.8% and 13.1% respectively). CONCLUSION: Although many factors have been known to play a role in the causation of low birth weight (LBW <2500g), parity status and malaria infection in malaria endemic areas still play a major role regardless of IPT administration."
41477408,Diagnostic Challenges in Capnocytophaga canimorsus Sepsis: A Case Report.,2025,"Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections, though rare, can be severe. Diagnosis is straightforward with a known dog-bite history, but is challenging otherwise. A 67-year-old woman with no immunodeficiency or alcohol abuse history presented with high fever (41.5 degrees C), vomiting, and altered consciousness. No neck stiffness or peritoneal irritation was observed. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzymes, creatine kinase, inflammatory markers, and lactate. Computed tomography suggested strangulated ileus, which was ruled out during emergency laparotomy. Postoperatively, she experienced shock and was treated with vasopressors, corticosteroids, and ampicillin-sulbactam. Her condition improved, and blood culture showed Gram-negative rods. On day 3, her husband mentioned a recent dog bite, and a Capnocytophaga infection was suspected. Continued treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam improved her symptoms, and she was discharged. Blood cultures confirmed C. canimorsus on day 10. In severe sepsis with delayed bacterial identification, C. canimorsus should be considered. Repeated history-taking and empirical beta-lactamase inhibitor treatment are crucial."
25518291,The efficacy of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone iodine in reducing blood culture contamination in pediatric patients.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis of septicemia. However; false-positive blood cultures are associated with increased health care costs due to unnecessary treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone iodine in reducing blood culture contamination inpediatricpatients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a prospective study of pediatric patients who were admitted at a tertiary-care hospital. Pediatric patients who neededpercutaneous blood cultures were recruitedfrom two general pediatric wards and the pediatric intensive care unit. The authors used 10% povidone iodine as an antiseptic in odd months and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol as an antiseptic in even months in obtaining the blood culture samples. RESULTS: There were 1,269 blood culture specimens taken from 821 patients. 654 specimens used 10%povidone iodine as an antiseptic and 619 specimens used 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol as an antiseptic. The 10% povidone iodine group and the 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol group had the risk of blood culture contamination of 3.21% (95%CI: 2.00%-4.87%) and 2.28% (95% CI: 1.25%-3.79%) respectively. The risk difference ofblood culture contamination was 0.93% (95% confidence interval: 0. 86-2.72%) with p = 0.31. The most common contamination organism was Coagulase negative staphylococci (68.57%). No adverse skin reactions were observed in both antiseptic solutions groups. CONCLUSION: Use of2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol as an antiseptic seems to reduce the risk of blood culture contamination compared to use of 10% povidone iodine. In addition, neither of the antiseptic solutions resulted in adverse skin reactions."
20151527,[Lung transplant in patients with sarcoidosis: 2 case reports and a pathophysiologic review].,2009,"Lung transplantation is an appropriate therapeutic option for patients with advanced sarcoidosis that has not responded to medical treatment. The causes of sarcoidosis are unknown and the course of disease and prognosis are highly variable. As it is difficult to determine the ideal timing for a transplant or the type of transplant to perform, this may influence the high perioperative mortality in these patients. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are high when pulmonary hypertension is present before the transplant or when primary graft failure, acute rejection, infection, or other complications develop afterwards. We describe 2 patients with a diagnosis of end-stage sarcoidosis who received a lung transplant and a heart-lung transplant. The outcomes were different in each case. We analyze factors related to morbidity and mortality that determined the outcomes."
25526004,Crusted scabies of the scalp in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Crusted scabies is a severe, hyperkeratotic, psoriasiform disorder associated with immune suppression. Affected individuals typically present with crusted hyperkeratotic lesions in a variety of locations. This condition can lead to severe complications: institutional outbreaks and secondary bacterial infections associated with sepsis and high mortality. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: A 37-year-old woman with a 12-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus treated with prednisone, methotrexate, and plaquenil presented with a three-week history of a painful scalp rash with adherent yellow scale. Skin biopsy and tissue culture were consistent with a diagnosis of crusted scabies with superficial bacterial infection. The patient was treated with oral ivermectin and permethrin cream, as well as ciprofloxacin for the bacterial infection. At one-week follow-up, the scalp was no longer tender and hyperkeratotic plaques had significantly improved. At one-month follow-up, the affected scalp demonstrated further improvement with decreasing erythema and alopecia with follicular ostia. CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the atypical presentation of crusted scabies with primary scalp involvement and need for vigilance in recognizing and appropriately treating this condition to prevent the consequences of longstanding infection. Combination treatment with ivermectin and permethrin is appropriate management for this condition."
31892631,Intracranial vessel occlusion preceding the development of mycotic aneurysms in patients with endocarditis.,2019,"Mycotic aneurysms (MA) are an uncommon complication of infectious endocarditis. Septic emboli are thought to be the precipitating event in their development, but the evidence for this is sparse. We present three cases in which septic embolic occlusion preceded MA development at the occlusion site, suggesting that documented angiographic emboli in patients with infectious endocarditis and bacteremia constitute a risk factor for MA formation. Two adult patients with a history of intravenous drug use and one child with congenital heart disease are described. They were all diagnosed with infectious endocarditis and developed neurological symptoms during their hospital course. Initial catheter-based cerebral angiograms demonstrated vascular occlusions, which were followed by the development of MA at the same sites within 1 month. Septic emboli, documented on cerebral angiogram, in patients with infectious endocarditis may precede the appearance of MA. Patients with angiographic occlusions in the setting of endocarditis warrant close follow-up."
41430584,The value of pathogen DNA load in evaluating the efficacy of bloodstream infection: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is increasingly being applied in clinical practice, with absolute quantification as one of its key advantages. This study aims to explore the significance of pathogen DNA load in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of bloodstream infection (BSI). METHODS: A total of 25 hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection were enrolled as research subjects. These patients were confirmed by ddPCR testing in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Fuyang People's Hospital, and admitted between November 2024 and April 2025. All patients showed clinical improvement after treatment and were discharged. Based on ddPCR results, they were divided into the Escherichia coli (E. coli) group (n=15) and the Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) group (n=10). Each patient underwent consecutive ddPCR testing three times, and data including general clinical information, laboratory test results, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were collected and analyzed. The study further aimed to investigate the value of dynamic changes in pathogen DNA load for evaluating efficacy of treatment in BSI and other potential clinical implications. RESULTS: Among the baseline data of two groups, the alanine aminotransferase（ALT）level in the K. pneumoniae group (52.8 U/L) was higher than that in the E. coli group (21.0U/L), and the medianl DNA load in the K.pneumoniae group(8329.2 copies/mL,[IQR]: 291.8-47722.4 copies/mL) was higher than that in the E. coli group (310.2 copies/mL,[IQR]: 129.0-1838.0 copies/mL). Meanwhile, Pearson correlation analysis showed no strong correlation between the initial DNA load and SOFA score in patients of the two groups. Dynamic observation indicated that the pathogen DNA load of BSI patients in both groups showed a decreasing trend; at the same time, the proportion of patients with normalized body temperature increased in each group. Further verification demonstrated a strong correlation between the changing trend of DNA load and C-reactive protein(CRP) as well as procalcitonin(PCT)(r ＞0.9).In addition, the rate of reduction in pathogen DNA load in the two groups was comparable to CRP and PCT. Finally, in the K. pneumoniae group, it was found when the DNA load cut-off value was set at 8329.23 copies/mL, it exhibited high sensitivity and high specificity for identifying the formation of secondary abscesses(AUC=1). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that DNA load levels of BSI vary significantly among different pathogens. More importantly, the dynamic changes in pathogen DNA load closely correlate with clinical outcomes, serving as a reliable and objective indicator to directly evaluate therapeutic efficacy in BSI patients. This highlights the practical clinical value of pathogen DNA load monitoring for real-time assessment of treatment response and optimization of clinical management strategies. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."
41561118,The multifaceted role of kallistatin in human diseases: mechanistic insights and translational potential.,2025,"Kallistatin, a multifunctional serine protease inhibitor, is widely distributed with tissue-specific effects. It may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human diseases. Through binding to its two structural elements and specific receptors, it regulates differential signaling cascades, and thus has a wide spectrum of biological functions. In cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure, it exerts protective effects by improving endothelial function, anti-inflammation, and regulating lipid metabolism. In liver diseases, high hepatic expression correlates with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, while decreased serum levels indicate severe cirrhosis or liver fibrosis. In metabolic diseases, it regulates insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammation. In inflammatory diseases, its role is dual: it attenuates inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, etc., but exacerbates chronic rhinosinusitis and autoimmune uveitis by promoting inflammatory cytokines secretion. In cancer, it inhibits tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, with lower tumor tissue expression linked to cancer development. Kallistatin also serves as a potential biomarker for chronic kidney disease, preterm birth, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on kallistatin's mechanisms in organ injury and repair, emphasizes its therapeutic potential across disease contexts, and discusses challenges and future directions for clinical translation, including organ-targeted strategies and combination therapies."
41404251,"A Comparison of Clinical, Neonatal, and Maternal Factors Between Early- and Late-Onset Group B Streptococcal Disease.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Universal group B streptococcus (GBS) screening in pregnant people and maternal antibiotic prophylaxis have reduced the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcus (EOGBS) infection. Despite a lower incidence, there is still a high risk of morbidity and mortality without treatment, and there is limited knowledge about late-onset group B streptococcus (LOGBS) infection. Using statewide neonatal sepsis surveillance and hospital admission data, this study describes factors associated with EOGBS and LOGBS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study combined statewide surveillance data for infants with GBS through Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) data between 2006 and 2020. Cases were defined as EOGBS (>7 days of age) or LOGBS (7-89 days of age). Chi-square tests and the Mann-Whitney test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 322 identified cases, 106 (32.9%) were EOGBS, and 216 (67.1%) were LOGBS. LOGBS had a higher rate of meningitis (n = 65, 30.1%) compared to EOGBS (n = 11, 10.4%) (p > 0.001) and had a higher percentage of diagnosis via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 51, 23.6%) compared to EOGBS (n = 5, 4.7%; p < 0.001). LOGBS were more likely to receive maternal antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis (n = 129, 61.1%) compared to EOGBS (n = 49, 46.2%; p = 0.012) and more doses of maternal antibiotics (3.39 doses) compared to EOGBS (1.59 doses, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in epidemiology and clinical manifestations of EOGBS and LOGBS support different approaches to prevent each entity. Strategies for EOGBS prevention include maternal antibiotic prophylaxis and maternal screening. The transmission and pathogenesis of LOGBS are likely different than EOGBS, creating a need for different preventative strategies. Potential mechanisms to prevent LOGBS include maternal vaccination."
41466958,Immunosuppression Masking a Urological Emergency: A Case Report of Bilateral Infected Obstructed Kidneys.,2025,"An infected obstructed kidney is a urological emergency with the potential to cause life-threatening sepsis. It is often due to ureteric calculi and requires urgent decompression by ureteric stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. We present a patient who presented with bilateral obstructed kidneys secondary to ureteric stones while on immunosuppressive therapy. A middle‑aged woman with prior bilateral lung transplants on tacrolimus and prednisolone presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Clinical examination was unremarkable, and blood tests showed normal inflammatory markers and renal function. CT imaging revealed a 6 mm right distal ureteric calculus and a 4 mm left vesicoureteric junction calculus with subtle obstructive features. Despite atypical findings, urological intervention was pursued, given ongoing sepsis and absence of alternative pathology. The patient underwent bilateral ureteric stenting and was admitted to intensive care, recovered well, and was discharged. Elective ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy achieved stone clearance six weeks later, with no recurrence at six‑month follow‑up. She has been discharged from urology follow-up. The case underscores the challenges in diagnosis and management of immunosuppressed patients, where atypical clinical presentations may cause diagnostic uncertainties. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential to achieve optimal outcomes in such complex scenarios."
41676054,Use of LVAD HeartMate 3 and Impella RP in the management of advanced heart failure in an elderly patient: a case report.,2026,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."
20084910,[Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection in respiratory intensive care unit].,2009,"Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter boumannii is a challenge in the treatment and control of nosocomial infections. This retrospective study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of multidrug resistant A. boumannii in a respiratory intensive care unit (ICU), related risk factors and its impact on disease prognosis. Of 218 patients who were hospitalized in our ICU during the last two years; 37 (17%) patients (21 males, mean age 61.6 +/- 19.8 years) developed pneumonia and/or bacteremia due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Previous antibiotic therapy was detected in 51.4% and hospitalization in 70.3% of the cases. Pneumonia (59.5%) was the most frequent cause of hospitalization and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.6%) was the second one; 81.1% of patients had co-morbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation was performed in 31 (83.7%) patients during the follow-up. Ventilator-associated pneumonia developed in 22 (59.5%) patients and bacteraemia in 9 (24.3%) patients. Multidrug-resistance was observed in 23 (62.2%) of patients. Highest rates of resistance (100%) was detected against piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam and ciprofloxacin, followed by imipenem and cefepime (78%), meropenem and ceftazidime (55%), cefoperazone-sulbactam (43%) and netilmicin (35.1). The rates of re-intubation and tracheotomy were higher in patients infected with A. boumannii compared to the control group (59.5% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.0001 and 21.6% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of mortality, however, durations of ICU and hospital stays were longer in patients with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infection than without infection (24.2 +/- 18.3 vs. 8.2 +/- 8.3 days, p < 0.001 and 33.3 +/- 19.8 vs. 15.4 +/- 11.4 days, p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, due to the high rates of drug-resistance in nosocomial A.baumannii isolates, the use of invasive procedures and durations of ICU and hospital stays exhibit an increasing trend."
31852650,[Efficacy and safety of early physical therapy for acute gastrointestinal injury during mechanical ventilation in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled pilot trial].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of early physical therapy for acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in septic patients receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital from May, 2017 to March, 2018. The patients diagnosed with sepsis complicated by AGI during mechanical ventilation were recruited and block-randomized into intervention group and control group. Both groups received standard therapy of sepsis, and the patients in the intervention group also received physical therapy as soon as they were hemodynamically stable. The outcome measures included the recovery of AGI, ICU mortality, duration and outcomes of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were initially included, and 34 of them completed the study, including 16 in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. After physical rehabilitation, the number of patients with a cure of AGI did not significantly differ between the two group (P > 0.05). Nonetheless, the reduction of AGI scores after the treatments differed significantly between the intervention group and the control group (-1.9+/-2.1 vs 0.9+/- 1.6, P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the two groups in ICU mortality, duration and outcomes of mechanical ventilation, or the length of ICU stay (P > 0.05). In the intervention group, the incidence of exercise-related adverse events was 3.33%, and severe organ injury or death occurred in none of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early rehabilitation therapy does not reduce the incidence of AGI but can lower AGI scores and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with sepsis during mechanical ventilation. The results still await further verification by welldesigned multicenter clinical trials with large sample sizes."
41457758,Revolutionizing non-traumatic acute care: review of the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in triaging and diagnosis.,2025,"Acute care settings, including emergency medicine and intensive care units, comprise a substantial portion of healthcare and are essential in the prompt management of conditions that can prove fatal. Critical care conditions require timely management that can be delayed by high patient volumes and the need for complex clinical decision making. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been created to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflow to improve patient care. This narrative review discusses the current status of AI in acute care, with a focus on its applications in triaging and diagnosis. AI-enhanced electrocardiogram analysis, identification of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure risk stratification led to better patient-specific management and improved results. AI models successfully determined and aided in the timely management of various acute conditions, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The AI algorithms used accurately determined sepsis onset and course, superseding traditionally used clinical tools and leading to early diagnosis and reduced sepsis mortality. These models showed high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing and triaging neurological conditions, including altered levels of consciousness, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhages. AI that involved advanced machine learning imaging software led to faster and more accurate stroke diagnosis. Diagnostic tools assisted by AI improved the detection and classification of acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. AI has shown promising results in optimizing management in acute care settings. However, critical issues in data standardization, ethical considerations, and clinical workflow integration need to be addressed to enable clinical implementation."
15621899,Operative treatment of hip fracture in haemodialysed patients.,2004,"PURPOSE: To study operative treatment and postoperative clinical outcomes of hip fracture in haemodialysed patients. METHODS: In 12 patients (8 men and 4 women) undergoing haemodialysis, 14 hip fractures were treated. Of these, 8 hips were treated with bipolar hip arthroplasty, one hip with total hip arthroplasty, 4 hips with a compression hip screw, and one hip with a gamma nail. The mean duration of dialysis treatment until fracture was 7 years. During a mean postoperative follow-up period of 17 months (range, 1-44 months), the patients' renal condition, type of fracture, and level of activities of daily living before and after surgery were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 7 patients who died during a mean follow-up period of 17 months, 2 died from myocardial infarction, 2 from sepsis, and one each from gastric cancer, pulmonary oedema, and liver failure. Five of the 8 patients with diabetic nephropathy died, whereas 6 of the 8 patients who underwent bipolar hip arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty died. Most of the patients had declined level of activities of daily living postoperatively. CONCLUSION: For haemodialysed patients with fractures, it is essential to select the most suitable operating method and to conduct vigilant management before and after the operation."
20000057,Diagnosis of malaria by community health workers in Nigeria.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: The introduction of primary health care made Nigeria, a developing country, train and retrain community health workers to work all over the country especially in the rural communities where there is dearth of doctors. Despite their training and experience many people are skeptical of their competence to diagnose accurately what more treating endemic disease like malaria. The need to find out the diagnostic competence of the health workers in malaria control programme now in Nigeria necessitated this study. METHOD: A rural primary health centre, the sentinel site for malarial control programme investigation in Imo State of Nigeria was selected. The community health technician (CHT) was the health worker in charge. Those who were diagnosed as malaria patients by CHT were examined by a medical laboratory scientist (who was engaged specifically for this job) for malaria parasitaemia. The laboratory examination was Giamsa - stained thick blood from fingerprint. Those with positive parasite density count at 1000/microL and above were regarded as malaria patients. The study was from March - October 2007. RESULTS: The number diagnosed as malaria patients on clinical grounds by CHT was 2512 while the number diagnosed by both clinical and laboratory basis was 2490. The number of patients with wrong diagnosis of malaria by CHT was 22 (0.875%). CONCLUSION: The CHT is useful in the diagnosis and by extension in the control of such endemic disease as malaria where there is no laboratory facilities. Both the employers and populace should repose confidence in their services and in the area where they have been trained and acquired experience"
31927395,The stressed vascular barrier and coagulation - The impact of key glycocalyx components on in vitro clot formation.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A functional vascular barrier controlling leukocyte recruitment into the perivascular space relies on an intact endothelial glycocalyx (EGX). Critical disease states such as sepsis or trauma can induce massive shedding of EGX components into the blood stream. Previous studies have shown that high blood levels of EGX components are correlated with bleeding in patients. The mechanism behind that observation remains to be fully elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The EGX components syndecan-1 (S1), hyaluronic acid (HA) and heparan sulfate (HS) were added to blood samples of 10 healthy male volunteers separately in three distinct concentrations to mimic three severity levels of in vitro EGX shedding. We analyzed spiked blood samples for leukocyte derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as a measure for innate immune activation and evaluated the impact on coagulation using clinical standard coagulation tests (SCTs) as well as rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM(R)). RESULTS: Whereas ROS formation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was unaltered by all three substances, high concentrations of HS showed prolonged aPTT and TT compared to controls and S1 or HA. Changes in ROTEM(R) were discrete and mostly within normal range of values but analyses showed a significant reduction of clot firmness and formation by all EGX components compared to controls. Furthermore, alterations by HA and HS were dose dependent. Only HS showed a heparin like effect supporting the findings of SCTs. CONCLUSIONS: All EGX components interfere with clot formation and strength. HS mimics heparin effects in ROTEM(R) that confirm detectable alterations of standard coagulation tests."
41408176,Neonatal fungemia: a case series highlighting the threat posed by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species and a yeast-like filamentous fungus.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal fungemia represents a substantial contributor to morbidity and mortality in 25-30% of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), particularly affecting preterm or low-birth-weight infants. The immune systems of neonates, particularly those who are preterm, are underdeveloped, making them highly susceptible to infections like fungemia. CASES: In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), bloodstream infections (BSIs) were identified in 18 out of 72 cases, accounting for 25% of the total. Of these, five cases were attributed to fungal infections, constituting 27.7% of all infections over the past three months. This report concentrates on these five neonatal cases, which were diagnosed with fungemia, a form of bloodstream infection caused by Candida and yeast-like filamentous fungi, particularly affecting newborns. The non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, specifically Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida pelliculosa, as well as the arthroconidial yeast-like filamentous fungus Saprochaete capitata, have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. A significant proportion of these cases were outborn, with potential associations to risk factors such as maternal vaginal candidiasis or lapses in infection control measures during childbirth. All cases were identified within the first week of life and were consequently classified as early-onset neonatal sepsis. In addition to maternal risk factors, several neonates were delivered preterm, exhibited low birth weight, experienced respiratory distress, and required ventilatory support. Unfortunately, only two cases resulted in recovery and discharge, while the remaining three did not survive. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The prompt identification and management of conditions are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. This study highlights the critical role of non-albicans Candida species and other yeast-like invasive fungi as key factors in the onset of early neonatal sepsis within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)."
15684796,Safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in surgical patients with severe sepsis.,2004,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the overall safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in surgical patients with severe sepsis enrolled in PROWESS. METHODS: A blinded Surgical Evaluation Committee (SEC) verified surgical patients as having undergone a significant operative procedure within 30 days prior to enrollment. Serious and treatment-emergent bleeding events, both during the study drug infusion period (120 h) and the entire 28-day study period were analyzed by surgical status and by treatment assignment. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Serious bleeding rates during infusion in the surgical patients were 3.1% (7/228) and 0% (0/246) in the drotrecogin alfa (activated) and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.006). Treatment-emergent bleeding rates during infusion in the surgical patients were 16.7% (38/228) and 7.7% (19/246) in the drotrecogin alfa (activated) and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.003). None of the treatment-emergent bleeding events was fatal. Of seven drotrecogin alfa (activated) serious bleeding events, six were procedure-related. The serious bleeding rates within each treatment group were statistically indistinguishable between the medical and surgical patients. However, the medical patients had numerically higher treatment-emergent bleeding rates than the surgical patients within each treatment group. Despite this observation, overall surgical patients received more transfusions of red blood cells, of platelets, and of fresh frozen plasma than their medical counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment of surgical patients with drotrecogin alfa (activated) for severe sepsis is associated with a higher incidence of serious bleeding and subsequent treatment- emergent bleeding events, the magnitude of this increase is small and clinically acceptable."
41472734,Identification and validation of core biomarkers for sepsis: a comprehensive analysis using bioinformatics and machine learning.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to infection, requires timely and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Despite advances in medical research, identifying reliable biomarkers for sepsis remains a challenge. This study aims to identify and validate key biomarkers for sepsis, addressing the limitations of current diagnostic methods like the SOFA score, PCT, and CRP, particularly in terms of specificity and early detection. METHODS: We recruited 23 sepsis patients and 10 healthy controls, collecting peripheral blood samples for mRNA sequencing. Public datasets (GSE134347, GSE167363, and GSE220189) were also utilized for differential gene expression analysis. The expression and functions of these biomarkers were systematically verified through GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network construction, ROC curve analysis, AUC values of machine-learning models, survival analysis, and immune cell subset localization analysis. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified four core biomarkers-CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163-as significantly differentially expressed in sepsis patients. ROC curve and AUC analyses of machine-learning models showed AUC values exceeding 0.9 for these biomarkers across seven models, indicating superior diagnostic performance. Survival analysis revealed significant associations of KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 with sepsis prognosis. Specifically, higher expression levels of RETN and CD163 were linked to increased mortality risk, whereas higher KLRB1 levels were associated with decreased mortality risk. Immune cell-specific expression localization showed CD27 expression in T cells, KLRB1 in NK cells, RETN in monocytes and neutrophils, and CD163 in monocytes, indicating a cell-type-based immune regulatory network. CONCLUSION: CD27, KLRB1, RETN, and CD163 form a dynamic immune network that reflects the pathological progression of sepsis from hyper-inflammatory to immunosuppressive phases. Monitoring the expression changes of these biomarkers can accurately assess patients' immune status and guide clinical interventions, such as anti-inflammatory or immunostimulatory therapies. This study offers new directions for early diagnosis and individualized treatment of sepsis."
15686687,Cost efficiency in the prospective diagnosis and follow-up of polyomavirus allograft nephropathy.,2004,"Evaluation of urine cytology (UC) for decoy cells and quantitative determinations of viruria (urine viral load [UPCR])and viremia (viral load in blood [VLB]) have been proposed as surrogate markers of polyomavirus allograft nephropathy (PVAN). In this study, we present the experience with the concurrent evaluation of UC, UPCR, and VLB in 349 patients (940 sets of samples). Results were correlated with each other and with a previous, concurrent, or subsequent biopsy diagnosis of PVAN. Patients were followed up for a mean of 27 months posttransplantation. We conclude that both UC and UPCR are useful for screening of renal transplant recipients. Simultaneous performance of both UC and UPCR does not add useful clinical information. In patients with positive UC, performance of UPCR, however, can allow for the distinction between BK and JC polyoma viruses. Quantitative measurement of viremia is not indicated in patients lacking viruria because no patients with PVAN present with this combination of findings. In patients with viruria, a positive viremia strongly correlates with PVAN. Rationale selection of screening protocols based on the current knowledge of the infection and tailored to the available laboratory capabilities in each transplantation center can optimize the use of resources."
25575851,Impact of obesity on sepsis mortality: A systematic review.,2015,"PURPOSE: Sepsis and severe sepsis are the most common cause of death among critically ill patients admitted in medical intensive care units. As more than one-third of the adult population of the United States is obese; we undertook a systematic review of the association between obesity and mortality among patients admitted with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify pertinent studies using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies reporting mortality in obese patients admitted with sepsis were identified. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 183 studies of which 7 studies met our inclusion criteria. Three studies reported no significant association between obesity and mortality, 1 study observed increased mortality among obese patients, whereas 3 studies found lower mortality among obese patients. CONCLUSION: Our review of the current clinical evidence of association of obesity with sepsis mortality revealed mixed results. Clinicians are faced with a number of challenges while managing obese patients with sepsis and should be mindful of the impact of obesity on antibiotics administration, fluid resuscitation, and ventilator management. Further studies are needed to elicit the impact of obesity on mortality in patients with sepsis."
20013577,Baseline illness severity does not alter accuracy of neonatal sepsis screen.,2010,"We investigated the relationship between illness severity and accuracy of neonatal sepsis screen. Consecutive neonates with clinically suspected early onset sepsis (EOS) were enrolled and blood culture and sepsis screen [C-reactive protein, absolute neutrophil count, immature to total ratio (ITR) and microerythrocyte sedimentation rate] were performed. Exclusion criteria were prior antibiotic exposure, nonavailable reports, and contaminated cultures. Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE-II) was used to categorize neonates into ""mild to moderate"" (score <or=40) and ""severe"" (score >40) illness. Sepsis was defined as positive blood culture, and positive screen as >or=2 parameters positive. Of 125 subjects, 86 had mild to moderate and 39, severe illness. Twenty-eight (22%) subjects had sepsis. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, likelihood ratio of positive test, and likelihood ratio of negative test of the sepsis screen and screen parameters were similar between the two groups. The sensitivity of the screen was 37.5% and 25% for mild to moderate illness and severe illness, respectively. Only ITR values correlated with SNAPPE-II scores in patients with ""sepsis"" (rho 0.4; P = 0.036). The severity of underlying illness does not alter the performance of the sepsis screen in diagnosing culture-positive EOS."
41412563,Interferon regulatory factor 1 promotes pyroptosis and inflammation in mouse sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.,2026,"Although pyroptosis is involved in sepsis and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanims of myocardial pyroptosis in the progression of SIC. We first identified differentially expressed genes and hub pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in SIC using bioinformatics analyses and then constructed in vitro and in vivo SIC models to reveal the specific mechanisms of hub PRGs in SIC development. In this study, we confirmed eight hub PRGs (caspase-1, IRF1, IL-6, GSDMD, caspase-6, IL-1beta, caspase-8, and ZBP1) as potential candidate biomarkers for SIC and their expression change in cardiac tissue and myocardial cells in sepsis was fully validated through a serials of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, KEGG analysis displayed that these hub PRGs were enriched for NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways and IRF1 is an upstream regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. SIC mice treated with IRF1 inhibitor, N-acetyl- l-cysteine (NAC), showed notable amelioration of cardiac histological injury, reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, and decreased expression of NLRP3, pyroptosis-related markers, and pro-inflammatory factors. The IRF1-knockdown H9C2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory factors and pyroptosis-related markers. Overall, these findings suggest that IRF1 deficiency attenuates sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting pyroptosis and inflammation. Therefore, targeting IRF1 in cardiomyocytes may be a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing SIC."
32377252,METHIMAZOLE-INDUCED AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND SEPSIS: WAS THYROID STORM PRESENT OR JUST BEING MIMICKED?,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Agranulocytosis induced by thioamides is rare, occurring only in 0.2-0.5% of cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 45-year-old woman previously diagnosed with Graves' disease that discontinued the use of methimazole on her own. She attended the Emergency Department presenting fever (40.5 C), agitation and diaphoresis. A thyroid storm diagnosis was initially thought, but after laboratory results showing neutrophil count near 0.06x109/L, sepsis due to neutropenia seemed the most logical hypothesis. Cephepime was promptly initiated. For thyrotoxicosis management, cholestyramine and atenolol were prescribed. In her second day of hospitalization, subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was started for an earlier medullar response. The patient was discharged after 7 days with atenolol 50mg/day and instructed to have a definite treatment for Graves disease as soon as possible. CONCLUSION: Such case purpose is to remember clinicians that sepsis diagnosis can be challenged, especially when a thyroid storm is a possible diagnosis as well. In this particular case, both conditions should be treated, but life-threatening sepsis should have the focus for a quick therapeutic approach."
32166281,Circulating Gasdermin-D in Critically Ill Patients.,2019,"The key to further improving outcomes in sepsis lies in understanding and abrogating the dysfunctional immune response that leads to organ failure. Activation of gasdermin-D, a pore-forming protein within the inflammasome cascade, has recently been recognized as the critical step in pyroptosis and organ dysfunction. In this study, we sought to investigate the presence of gasdermin-D in critically ill subjects. DESIGN SETTING AND PATIENTS: Prospective pilot study comparing microparticulate active gasdermin-D levels in critically ill patients admitted to the medical ICU at The Ohio State University Medical Center to healthy donors and clinical outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma was collected from subjects upon consent and microparticles were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Proteins of interest were identified by immunoblot analysis of microparticle lysates. Quantification was accomplished by densitometry using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Investigators were then unblinded and compared microparticulate active gasdermin-D levels to physician adjudicated clinical diagnoses and outcomes. No appreciable levels of active gasdermin-D were observed in microparticles from healthy volunteers and nonseptic critically ill patients. However, elevated levels of gasdermin-D were noted in microparticles from the septic cohort of critically ill patients. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation by linear regression was noted when microparticulate active gasdermin-D levels were compared with microparticulate levels of CD63, an exosomal marker, CD14, a monocyte marker, and CD69, a marker of monocyte activation (R (2) = 0.37, p = 0.0011, R (2) = 0.85, p < 0.0001, and R(2) = 0.43, p = 0.0003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate circulating active gasdermin-D in septic patients in the intensive care setting. Our findings also suggest that active gasdermin-D in septic patients is encapsulated in exosomes derived from activated monocytes. Further characterization in the clinical setting is warranted."
15679235,"[Retrospective study of bacteremia diagnosed in an emergency department: frequency, susceptibility of microorganisms, and impact on therapeutic management].",2004,"OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to determine the prevalence of bacteremia diagnosed in an emergency department (ED), the susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics, and the impact on therapeutic management. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was made on patient features, microbiological ecology, susceptibility to antibiotics, and modalities of antimicrobial therapy in the Georges Pompidou European hospital ED of Hopital, between 1 November 2001 and 30 June 2002. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and thirty two blood cultures were obtained from 1069 patients. The rate of positive cultures was 12%, but only 8.7% (n = 125) were proved as true bacteremia. The most frequently identified organisms were: Enterobacteriaceae (n = 63, 39.4%) with a predominance of Escherichia coli (n = 48, 30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 16, 10%). Forty two cases of pyelonephritis and 34 of prostatitis both due to E. coli were diagnosed. 76.5% of these were resistant to amoxicillin, 64.7% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 11.8% to ciprofloxacin, and 44% to cotrimoxazole. No resistance to third generation cephalosporin was detected in E. coli isolates. Fourteen S. pneumoniae pneumonia cases were diagnosed. 57.1% of isolates presented with a decreased susceptibility to penicillin (CMI > 0.1 mg/l). Susceptibility to amoxicillin and cefotaxim was 85.7% and 92.9% respectively. Blood culture was the only exam available for bacterial diagnosis in 51.5% of true bacteremia. 1.6% of blood cultures from ED samples had an impact on therapeutic management. CONCLUSIONS: Blood culture is a relevant exam for the diagnosis of infection in patients admitted to the ED."
20146954,[Exsudative pleurisy revealing an infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta].,2010,"INTRODUCTION: The development of a sero-sanguinous pleural effusion is a rare, often overlooked, manifestation of a ruptured infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. CASE REPORT: A man of 84years was referred for management of a left-sided pleural effusion associated with symptoms of infection. He had presented two months previously with methicillin resistant staphylococcal septicaemia, the origin of which was a plantar ulcer. The patient was apyrexial and had no abdominal pain. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan without contrast showed a peri-aortic abdominal mass suggesting a tumour. A contrast enhanced scan and peri-aneurysmal aspiration showed that it was an infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta that had ruptured into the left pleural cavity. The progress was unfavourable despite double antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In the face of a sero-sanguinous pleurisy, particularly if associated with unexplained symptoms of infection, a search should be made for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Surgical treatment of the aneurysm should be undertaken if the general condition of the patient and the localisation and morphology of the aneurysm permit."
41602321,Risk factors for hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and ibuprofen treatment failure in premature twins: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Premature twins face a dual challenge: a high incidence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and a poor response to ibuprofen. Current management, derived from singleton data, fails to address this population's unique risks. Our study specifically investigates risk factors for hsPDA development and ibuprofen treatment failure in preterm twins to enable personalized prevention and therapy. Thus, the potential biomarkers for the occurrence of hsPDA and ibuprofen closure failure were examined. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective case-control study. 736 twin infants born at </=34 weeks of gestation were included, of which 70 were exposed to hsPDA and 66 were exposed to ibuprofen. Clinical data were obtained from the Electronic Medical Record system. For the occurrence of hsPDA and failure of ibuprofen treatment, multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the independent risk factor and the potential biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: 1. When compared to the non-hsPDA group, the hsPDA group demonstrated markedly higher incidences of low birth weight, lower gestational age, male gender, low 5 min Apgar scores, selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), use of pulmonary surfactant, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), >/=grade III intraventricular hemorrhage, and early-onset sepsis (p < 0.05). The hsPDA group had a notably higher rate of sIUGR (28.6%) relative to the non-hsPDA group (15.2%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, in twins with sIUGR, the larger infant exhibited a higher hsPDA incidence than the non-hsPDA group (p < 0.05). 2. Univariate analysis revealed that vaginal delivery, birth weight, gestational age, male gender, 5 min Apgar score, early-onset sepsis, RDS, and sIUGR were associated with the occurrence of hsPDA (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression identified sIUGR [odds ratio (OR) = 3.337, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.301-8.560] as an independent risk factor (IRF), while a higher birth weight (OR = 0.537, 95% CI 0.437-0.660) was noted to be a protective factor (p < 0.05). 3. Compared with the successful treatment group, the treatment failure group showed higher rates of premature rupture of membranes (PROMs) > 18 h, postnatal surfactant use, and monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins (p < 0.0167, Bonferroni correction). The treatment failure group included 11 MCDA cases (73.3%), markedly more than the successful treatment group (33.3%, p = 0.006). 4. Univariate regression analysis identified gestational age, birth weight, MCDA, 5 min Apgar score, and PROMs > 18 h as factors associated with ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression revealed MCDA (OR = 4.686, 95% CI 1.070-20.530) and PROMs > 18 h (OR = 15.198, 95% CI 2.377-97.178) as IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure (p < 0.05). 5. In the pharmacological closure group, MCDA twins exhibited markedly lower closure rates after both the first and total two courses compared to dichorionic diamniotic twins (p < 0.05). MCDA twins required higher cumulative drug doses (40.21 +/- 1.27 vs. 32.21 +/- 0.53, p < 0.05), although no significant difference in the frequency of administration was detected. The MCDA group also had a higher rate of surgical interventions (39.29% vs. 10.53%, p < 0.05). 6. The NT-proBNP, Hs-cTn, PGE2, Cortisol, and TXA2 levels in the sIUGR group were markedly elevated versus those in the non-sIUGR group, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In preterm twins </=34 weeks, sIUGR is an IRF for hsPDA. In addition, MCDA and PROMs > 18 h are IRFs for ibuprofen treatment failure. Meanwhile, elevated levels of NT-proBNP and Hs-cTn may play a role in the development of hsPDA in preterm infants with sIUGR."
32514461,Survival benefit associated with early detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in veteran inpatients with cirrhotic ascites.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is common in hospitalized cirrhotic patients with ascites and carries high mortality. This study aimed to determine whether early diagnostic paracentesis (EDP) <12 h of hospitalization conveys an intermediate-term (6-month) survival benefit in cirrhotic patients diagnosed with SBP. METHODS: Consecutive US veterans with cirrhosis diagnosed with SBP over 13 years at a single VA medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Kaplan-Meyer analyses assessed the effects of EDP on survival. RESULTS: A total of 79 cirrhotic patients were diagnosed with SBP (61.8 +/- 8.8 years, n = 77 male, n = 52 [66.8%] Caucasian, n = 23 [29.1%] African-American). Underlying liver diseases included hepatitis c viral infection (HCV) (17.5%), alcohol (28.6%), alcohol and HCV (30.1%), and cryptogenic/metabolic (15.9%). Median baseline model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was 12 (range 6-34), and median MELD at presentation was 18. Seven subjects had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (11.1%), and 26 (41.3%) presented with sepsis. Thirty-three (52.4%) subjects died within 6 months after the SBP admission. Of the subjects, 41 (65.1%) underwent EDP, of which 23 (56.0%) survived at least 6 months, compared to only 7 of the 22 patients (31.8%) undergoing paracentesis >12 h from presentation (P = 0.057). The maximal benefit of EDP on survival was observed beyond days 14 and 30; at these time points, no statistical difference in mortality was discernable (P = 0.55 and 0.71). In a multivariate model including age, MELD at admission, hepatocellular cancer, and sepsis criteria, EDP (p 0.034) positively impacted patient survival at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: EDP is associated with improved 6-month mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In this veteran cohort, EDP was as important as MELD as a predictor of intermediate-term survival."
25552279,Concentrated parenteral nutrition solutions and central venous catheter complications in preterm infants.,2015,"Standardised, concentrated neonatal parenteral nutrition (PN) regimens can overcome early nutritional deficits in very preterm infants. A PN regimen with increased macronutrient content (standardised, concentrated, added macronutrients parenteral (SCAMP)) has been shown to improve early head growth in a randomised controlled trial. Line complications including late onset sepsis were secondary outcomes of this study. Infants were started on standardised, concentrated PN at birth and randomised at 2-5 days to either switch to SCAMP or remain on control PN. Central venous catheter (CVC), blood culture (BC) and inflammatory marker data were collected for the 28-day intervention period. 150 infants were randomised with mean (SD) birth weight (g) of 900 (158) versus 884 (183) in SCAMP (n=74) and control (n=76) groups, respectively. There were no differences in CVC use/type or duration or in positive/negative BC with/without associated C reactive protein rise in SCAMP versus control groups. Increasing the macronutrient content of a standardised, concentrated neonatal PN regimen does not increase CVC complication rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 76597892."
25495277,Differential detection of classical swine fever virus challenge strains in C-strain vaccinated pigs.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Control of classical swine fever (CSF) by vaccination ideally requires that field strain infection can be detected irrespective of the vaccination status of the herd. To inform on the usefulness of molecular tests compatible with genetic Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) principles when using live-attenuated vaccines, tonsil homogenates from a vaccination-challenge experiment were analyzed using a differential real-time qRT-PCR for the C-strain vaccine or real-time qRT-PCR assays developed to specifically detect the challenge strains used. RESULTS: In animals with high or moderate levels of blood viraemia, which were not, or not fully, protected by vaccination, challenge virus RNA was readily detected in tonsil homogenates. In three out of the seven vaccinated animals that had high or moderate viraemia, the vaccine strain RNA also could be detected but at lower levels. Lower but varying levels of challenge and/or vaccine virus RNA were detected in tonsil homogenate samples from animals with no or low-level viraemia, and in groups solely consisting of such animals, no transmission of infection to naive in-contact animals occurred. In one group of animals that were vaccinated 3 days prior to challenge, viraemia levels varied from high to absent and transmission of challenge virus to naive in-contact animals occurred. The DIVA assay revealed challenge virus in all tonsil homogenates from this group, even in those animals that did not have viraemia and were protected from clinical disease by vaccination. Such animals, particularly in a low biosecurity/informal farm setting, could constitute a risk for disease control in the field. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic DIVA testing is useful for detecting the presence of field virus infection especially in non-viraemic animals without overt clinical signs but which are incompletely protected by vaccination. Such tests could particularly be useful to inform decisions prior to and during cessation of a control strategy that employs vaccination."
15588429,Endotoxin signaling in human macrophages: signaling via an alternate mechanism.,2004,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signals through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the course of sepsis, resulting in the release of inflammatory factors. In cell lines and murine models, parts of the signaling pathways involved have been elucidated with MyD88, Mal/TIRAP and IKK2 playing an important role in the induction of NF-kappaB. By focusing on primary human cells, we have shown that there are fundamental signaling differences between human and murine macrophages and between cells of myeloid and non-myeloid origins. In primary human cells, there are no available knockouts so we employed the use of dominant negatives to investigate the signaling cascades. We show that in primary human macrophages MyD88, Mal/TIRAP and IKK2-independent alternative pathways activate NF-kappaB and induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas in non-myeloid synovial fibroblasts MyD88 and/or Mal/TIRAP are essential adaptors for LPS signaling."
33995575,The multidisciplinary care of a woman presenting with lymphoma in pregnancy whose delivery was also complicated by placenta accreta spectrum.,2021,"We report the case of a 44-year-old presenting with breathlessness in her second trimester of pregnancy diagnosed with pulmonary diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) which was further complicated by a placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorder. In pregnancy, she was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisolone, which was associated with neutropenic sepsis requiring admissions to the intensive care unit with respiratory compromise. She safely delivered an infant at 31 weeks but required a hysterectomy at the time for PAS and seven days ventilation on the intensive care unit post-operatively. It is the first case report of DLBCL and PAS in pregnancy."
31851882,Usefulness of Early C-Reactive Protein Kinetics in Response and Prognostic Assessment in Infected Critically Ill Patients: An Observational Retrospective Study.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: The ideal biomarker to assess response and prognostic assessment in the infected critically ill patient is still not available. The aims of our study were to analyze the association between early C-reactive protein kinetics and duration and appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and its usefulness in predicting mortality in infected critically ill patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have carried out an observational retrospective study in a cohort of 60 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia at an intensive care unit. We have collected C-reactive protein consecutive serum levels for eight days as well as duration and appropriateness of initial antibiotic therapy. C-reactive protein kinetic groups were defined based on the levels at days 0, 4 and 7. With a follow-up of one year, we have evaluated mortality at different time-points. RESULTS: We have obtained three different C-reactive protein kinetic groups from the sample: fast response, delayed but fast response and delayed and slow response. We did not find statistically significant associations between C-reactive protein kinetics and early (intensive care unit, hospital and 28-days) or late (six months and one year) mortality and antibiotic therapy duration (p > 0.05). Although there were no statistically significant differences between the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and the defined groups (p = 0.265), no patient with inappropriate antibiotic therapy presented a fast response pattern. DISCUSSION: Several studies suggest the importance of this protein in infection. CONCLUSION: Early C-reactive protein kinetics is not associated with response and prognostic assessment in infected critically ill patients. Nevertheless, a fast response pattern tends to exclude initial inappropriate antibiotic therapy."

25705419,A validation of presepsin levels in kidney dysfunction patients: four case reports.,2014,"Here, we measured presepsins (PSPs) in four patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) and discuss the relationship between PSP and kidney dysfunction. Case 1: an 83-year-old man was admitted to the ICU to manage postoperative respiratory failure with AKI. He had undergone resection for rectal cancer and ileal conduit replacement. On day 1 in the ICU, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was isolated by urine culture. PSP level (pg/ml) on day 2 was 2,745 without elevation of other conventional biomarkers. On day 6, the patient was diagnosed with severe sepsis, and E. coli was isolated by blood culture. By then, PSP had risen to 3,977, along with elevation of other conventional biomarkers. His kidney function recovered gradually after continuous administration of hemodiafiltration; however, PSP continued to rise up to 6,051, along with high systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II values. The patient expired on day 13 due to multiple organ failure. Case 2: a 78-year-old woman with CKD on hemodialysis (HD) was admitted to the ICU after cardiovascular surgery. Continuous HD was administered postoperatively, and PSP ranged from 1,473-1,870 without signs of sepsis. Temporary elevation of other conventional biomarkers was observed postoperatively. Case 3: a 74-year-old woman with CKD on HD was admitted to the ICU after neurosurgery. She underwent intermittent HD postoperatively, and PSP ranged from 1,240-1,935 without sepsis symptoms. Temporary elevation of other conventional biomarkers was observed postoperatively. Case 4: a 62-year-old man with CKD was admitted to the ICU to control gastrointestinal bleeding. PSP was 606 without signs of infection or elevation of other conventional biomarkers. In cases 2, 3, and 4, bacteria were not isolated in blood cultures. Patients' clinical prognoses were good, with low or moderate SIRS and APACHE II scores. PSP in kidney dysfunction patients will be high despite non-infectious conditions. Therefore, evaluation of PSP in kidney dysfunction patients will be difficult. Further investigation is needed to clarify the relationship between PSP and kidney dysfunction."
31837190,CT findings in five dogs with surgically confirmed colonic torsion.,2020,"Colonic torsion is a life-threatening condition that results in colonic ischemia, necrosis, perforation, sepsis, and eventual death. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective case series study was to describe the CT findings in dogs with surgically confirmed colonic torsion. Medical records were searched for dogs with surgically confirmed colonic torsion following abdominal CT. Five dogs met the inclusion criteria. Three had a history of chronic intermittent diarrhea prior to presentation. Two dogs presented with acute vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and one dog presented with acute vomiting and lethargy. Computed tomographic findings in all dogs with surgically confirmed colonic torsion include: ""whirl sign,"" displacement and distension of the cecum and colon, focal narrowing of the colon, and distension of the mesenteric vasculature in all dogs (5/5); streaky peritoneal fat and peritoneal effusion (4/5), pneumatosis coli (2/5), small intestinal distension (2/5), portal vein thrombosis (1/5), and reduced colonic wall contrast enhancement (1/5). In all dogs (5/5), the torsion site was the descending colon and demonstrated an anticlockwise rotation. At surgery, three of the five dogs had a partial colonic torsion with hyperemia at the site of obstruction and two of the five dogs had a complete torsion with marked necrosis of the colonic wall. Displacement of the colon and cecum, segmental distension and focal narrowing of the colon, the presence of a ""whirl sign"" and distension of the mesenteric vasculature are CT findings highly suggestive of colonic torsion."
41430347,"Plasmodium knowlesi gametocyte carriage and load among malaria patients at Kapit Hospital in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.",2025,"The number of human infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite typically found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, have increased and P. knowlesi has become the sole cause of indigenous cases of malaria in Malaysia since 2018. The reasons for the increase are multifactorial and could include human-to-human transmission through mosquito bites. Such transmission would require viable gametocytes circulating in the blood of infected individuals as this is the only parasite blood stage transmissible to mosquitoes. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of P. knowlesi malaria patients with viable gametocytes and to determine the association between gametocyte load and duration of illness prior to hospital admission, and with total parasitaemia. The mRNA transcripts of pks25, a gene expressed in mature female P. knowlesi gametocytes, were measured by a real-time PCR assay in blood samples from 295 patients at Kapit Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo with PCR-confirmed single infections of P. knowlesi. Viable gametocytes were present in 67.5% (199/295) of patients. A positive correlation was seen between gametocyte load and total parasitaemia (rho = 0.32, p = 0.01), whereas there was no statistically significant association between gametocyte carriage and duration of illness prior to hospitalisation (rho = 0.28, p = 0.7). Forty (20%) of 199 gametocyte-positive samples had fewer than 500 pks25 transcript copies/microL, but 25 (12.5%) of 199 gametocyte-positive patients had elevated levels of gametocytes; 13 (10.8%) had between 10,001 and 100,000 and 12 (6%) had > 100,000 pks25 transcript copies/microL. Our findings demonstrate the presence of viable gametocytes in a substantial proportion of patients, including some with relatively high densities. This observation, taken together with other findings, underscores the potential of humans to serve as infectious hosts of P. knowlesi, but they do not constitute direct evidence of human-to-human transmission. Significant gaps still remain in our understanding of P. knowlesi gametocyte biology and infectivity. Addressing these gaps is essential to ascertain whether human-to-human transmission of P. knowlesi, which was experimentally demonstrated in the 1960s, occurs in natural settings. Continued surveillance of human P. knowlesi infections together with studies on gametocyte biology, vector bionomics, and monitoring of macaque host populations in relation to environmental alterations are vital to understand changes in the dynamics of P. knowlesi malaria transmission, and to inform strategies for its control and prevention."
26357787,Hemolysis-Associated Nitric Oxide Dysregulation during Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.,2014,"Acute intravascular hemolysis during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) leads to increased levels of cell-free hemoglobin (FHb). Our aim was to investigate whether FHb levels are associated with nitric oxide (NO) consumption and clinical outcomes. A prospective observational study was performed involving pediatric patients on ECMO. Blood samples were collected before, during, and after the ECMO run, and plasma was evaluated for FHb, oxyhemoglobin, and NO consumption. Clinical data were collected including baseline patient characteristics, indications for ECMO, circuit changes, and mortality. Correlations between laboratory measures and associations between laboratory measures and clinical observations were evaluated. Twenty-three patients (11 male, 17 neonates) were enrolled with a median weight of 3.1 kg (interquartile range, 2.8-14.0 kg) and median ECMO run of 12 days (interquartile range, 5-19 day). There was a significant increase in FHb over time on ECMO (p = .007), and significant correlations were present between NO consumption and both FHb (r = .41, p = .01) and oxyhemoglobin levels (r = .98, p < .0001). Patients on ECMO for sepsis (n = 6) had lower average levels of oxyhemoglobin (mean [standard deviation SD] 14.5 [4.4] versus 19.0 [5.0] muM, p = .07) and NO consumption (mean [SD] 15.8 [4.1] versus 19.8 [3.7] muM, p = .04) during ECMO than patients with other indications. In the 3 days leading up to a circuit change, there were increases in mean total cell-free hemoglobin levels (24%/day, p = .08), oxyhemoglobin (37%/day, p = .005), and NO consumption (40%/day, p = .006) (n = 5). There were no significant associations identified between peak or average plasma measures of hemolysis and type of ECMO (venovenous versus venoarterial) or mortality. For children on ECMO, we observed a strong correlation between increased levels of plasma FHb and elevations in oxyhemoglobin and NO consumption; however, these changes were not associated with increased mortality. Increased hemolysis before circuit changes may be both a marker and a contributor to circuit failure."
25694763,Alpha1-microglobulin as an early biomarker of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective cohort study.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis emerges as the leading risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) development in critically ill patients. Much effort has been invested so far on early diagnosis of AKI using promising biomarkers. This study aimed to determine whether urine alpha1-microglobulin (alpha1m), a lipocaline member previously used as an indicator of proximal tubular dysfunction, can early predict the development of sepsis-associated AKI (SAAKI) in critically ill patients. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in a single center Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patients with normal renal function admitted to the ICU followed for sepsis and AKI development. Urine alpha1m levels were analyzed in pooled samples from 24-hour urine collections on sepsis onset and at various time points thereafter. The diagnostic performance of urine alpha1m was assessed using thenonparametriccalculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Among 286 critically ill patients admitted to our ICU in a year, 45 patients with sepsis met the inclusion criteria. SAAKI developed in 16 septic patients (35.6%). Urine alpha1m levels were significantly elevated in all septic patients (average value of all samples on the day of sepsis: 46.02 +/- 7.17 mg/l) and showed a trend to increase in patients who finally developed SAAKI. The AUC for SAAKI prediction according to alpha1m urine levels 24-hours before SAAKI onset was 0.739 (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 62.07%, cutoff level 47.9 mg/l). Urine alpha1m 24-hours before SAAKI, serum creatinine on sepsis onset and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score on sepsis onset emerged as the most powerful independent predictors of SAAKI. The combination of these three parameters improved the AUC for SAAKI prediction to 0.944. CONCLUSION: Urine alpha1m levels might help in the early prediction of SAAKI development and may prove useful biomarker. The pathogenetic implications of alpha1m in sepsis and SAAKI need further investigation. Hippokratia 2014; 18 (3): 262-268."
19934917,Outcome of salvage surgery for ileal pouches referred with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Technical complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis may be mislabeled as Crohn's disease. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with a potential misdiagnosis of Crohn's disease who have undergone redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. METHODS: We evaluated a historical cohort of patients, initially referred from outside institutions with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch, who subsequently had redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (redo pouch or pouch revision for pouch failure) at our institution. With the use of validated questionnaires, the functional outcomes and quality of life of this cohort were compared with a control group of patients who underwent primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to assess whether a change in the diagnosis from Crohn's disease to technical complications was appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent a redo pouch procedure for a previous diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch. Precolectomy diagnosis included ulcerative colitis (31 patients) and indeterminate colitis (2 patients). Findings on our further evaluation and subsequent indications for repeat pouch surgery included pouch fistula (20 patients), pelvic sepsis or anastomotic leak (17 patients), stricture (4 patients), refractory pouchitis (2 patients), long exit conduit (1 patient), and retained rectal stump (1 patient). All patients had medical treatment for Crohn's disease before referral. Median time between primary and redo pouch was 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.8-4.9). Median follow-up was 1.7 years (interquartile range, 1.0-3.5). Pouch retention rate was 84.8%. Five patients (15.2%) had pouch failure. Seven patients (21.2%) ultimately had pathology consistent with Crohn's disease. Comparison of the redo pouch and control groups revealed that functional outcomes and quality of life were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Patients identified as having Crohn's disease need to be carefully reevaluated because some of these patients may actually have surgery-associated complications and can have a favorable long-term outcome after redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis."
25499195,A newly developed kit for the measurement of urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein as a biomarker for acute kidney injury in patients with critical care.,2015,"In recent years, it has been reported that the urinary level of Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) serves as a useful biomarker for diagnosing acute kidney injury (AKI) or sepsis complicated by AKI. However, because the urinary level of L-FABP is currently measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), several days may elapse before the results of the measurement become available. We have newly developed a simplified kit, the Dip-test, for measuring the urinary level of L-FABP. The Dip-test was measured at 80 measurement points (22 points in noninfectious disease, 13 points in SIRS, 20 points in infectious disease, and 25 points in sepsis) in 20 patients. The urinary L-FABP levels as determined by ELISA in relation to the results of the Dip-test were as follows: 10.10 +/- 12.85 ng/ml in patients with a negative Dip-test ([-] group), 41.93 +/- 50.51 ng/ml in patients with a +/- test ([+/-] group), 70.36 +/- 73.70 ng/ml in patients with a positive test ([+] group), 1048.96 +/- 2117.68 ng/ml in patients with a 2 + test ([2+] group), and 23,571.55 +/- 21,737.45 ng/ml in patients with a 3 + test ([3+] group). The following tendency was noted: the stronger the positive Dip-test reaction, the higher the urinary L-FABP level. Multigroup comparison revealed a significant differences in the urinary L-FABP levels between the Dip-test (-) group and each of the other groups. In this study, the usefulness of the Dip-test, our newly developed simplified kit for measuring the urinary L-FABP level, is suggested."
41607523,"Epidemiological characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens isolated from blood cultures in southern Jiangxi, China, 2020-2024.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the distribution characteristics and dynamic trends of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens isolated from blood cultures of adult patients at a large tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi Province, China, from 2020 to 2024, in order to provide evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of bloodstream infections. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of non-repetitive isolates from blood cultures of adult patients at a large tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi Province between 2020 and 2024. Statistical analysis was performed using WHONET 5.6 and SPSS Statistics 30 software. RESULTS: This study included a total of 3,695 pathogenic bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria predominating (61.92%,2,288/3,695). Among Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (28.99%,1,071/3,695) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.72%,544/3,695) were the most prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance analysis revealed that the detection rate of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) surged sharply from 1.2% (1/82) in 2020 to 21.8% (26/119) in 2024; the detection rate of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) increased from 33.3%(5/15) in 2020 to 76.5% (13/17) in 2024. In contrast, the detection rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decreased significantly from 24.3% (17/73) in 2020 to 13.5% (10/74) in 2024. Among Enterococci, the rate of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR, defined as resistance to 500 microg/ml gentamicin) in Enterococcus faecium increased significantly, from 10% (1/10) in 2020 to 66.7% (14/21) in 2024, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) was detected at a rate of 9.5% (2/21) in 2024. CONCLUSION: In a tertiary hospital in southern Jiangxi, China, Gram-negative bacteria predominate among Patients with positive blood cultures, with sharply rising detection rates of CRKP, CRAB, and VREfm posing a public health threat. Meanwhile, the declining prevalence of MRSA indicates that infection control measures are effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, continuous surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is essential, and antimicrobial stewardship measures must be implemented immediately to curb their spread. A limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single center, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other regions."
41459929,Pharmacokinetics and safety of fosfomycin and flomoxef administered as part of neonatal sepsis treatment (NeoSep1 Part 1).,2026,"Neonatal doses for the off-patent antibiotics fosfomycin and flomoxef, which offer coverage against many extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, are based on limited data. We performed a pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study of fosfomycin and flomoxef to confirm proposed neonatal dosing before further investigation in a trial (NeoSep1, ISRCTN48721236). Neonates with suspected sepsis, weighing more than 1,000 g, were sequentially enrolled into three antibiotic treatment cohorts: fosfomycin and amikacin (Cohort 1), flomoxef and amikacin (Cohort 2), and flomoxef and fosfomycin (Cohort 3), and followed for 28 days. Plasma samples were taken for PK assessment, with population PK modeling and simulations performed. Sixty-two neonates (48/62 [77%] preterm; 48/62 [77%] </=7 days postnatal age [PNA]) received at least one dose of study antibiotics. Fosfomycin and flomoxef plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment and a one-compartment model, respectively, with postmenstrual age and PNA significantly influencing clearance. The probability of target attainment for fosfomycin was 100% for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of up to 8 mg/L, and for flomoxef, it was 100% for MICs of up to 0.5 mg/L. Adverse events (AEs) were common in this critically ill cohort. Thirteen (21%) neonates developed 19 trial antibiotic-related AEs (17 with grade </=2, and 2 of grade 3), none of which required modification or discontinuation of allocated treatment. Seven neonates (11.6%) died. In this predominately preterm population, fosfomycin and flomoxef were safe, with drug exposures similar to published studies supporting the proposed doses for the larger, randomized NeoSep1 trial.This study is registered with ISRCTN48721236."
15735769,[Mitral valve repair in children for acquired valvular disease].,2004,"BACKGROUND: Valve surgery in children is aimed at restoring correct hemodynamics with few reoperations and limited resort to prostheses, which would imply early deterioration or definitive hypocoagulation. OBJECTIVES: Report a series of paediatric pts with acquired mitral valve disease, mostly due to rheumatic disease, in whom it was possible, for the great majority, to repair the damaged valve. DEMOGRAPHICS: Fifty children with predominant mitral valve disease, 47 rheumatic (94%) and 3 after endocarditis were consequently operated by the same surgical team over the last five years. Ages were 12.5+/-3.1 yrs and weights 33.2+/-8.4 Kg, 30 pts presented with predominant mitral regurgitation and 20 pts had significant stenosis. In 8 pts there also moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and in 2 pts severe tricuspid regurgitation was present. Patients were not operated during the acute phase of the disease. Five pts were reoperations and from those, all but one received mechanical prosthesis. RESULTS: In all operations the intention was to repair the mitral valve. In 46 pts complex mitral valvuloplasties were performed extended comissurotomies, shortening of chordae, chordal replacement with PTFE, and reconstruction of valve leaflefts by direct patching or pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet (78.2% cases), plus reshaping of the annulus by using a fixed prosthetic CE ring (sizes 26 to 32) in every case. Ring sizes correlated poorly with body weights, but correlation was close and positive for the use of pericardial advancement of the posterior leaflet (p<0.01). There was no operative mortality, but one pt died early from sepsis and there was no late mortality. Maximum follow up extends now to 50 months (median 28 months) and functional evaluation, at latest follow up, as assessed by Doppler Echocardiography, showed residual mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate in 4 pts and LA-LV gradients mild in 5 and moderate in 2 pts. NYHA functional class, at present follow-up is class I for 43 pts (88%) and class II in the remaining 6 pts. Along the follow-up period 2 pts had to be reoperated for early repair failures and other three for late failures, presently freedom for reoperation is 91.8% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair in children with rheumatic lesions can be achieved for the great majority of cases by using different techniques. Pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet allowed the use of a bigger size prosthetic ring. Intermediate functional results are good with fair functional classes and few reoperations but follow-up is short and does not allow us to draw conclusions about the long-term results of the repair in these rheumatic patients."
20015219,Persistence of CCR5 usage among primary human immunodeficiency virus isolates of individuals receiving intermittent interleukin-2.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of intermittent interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on HIV-1 entry co-receptor use. METHODS: Primary HIV-1 isolates were obtained from 54 HIV-1-positive individuals at baseline and after 12 months using co-cultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with activated PBMC of HIV-negative healthy donors. HIV-1 co-receptor use was determined on U87-CD4 cells. RESULTS: Fourteen out of the 21 (67%) IL-2-treated individuals harbouring a primary CCR5-dependent (R5) HIV-1 isolate at baseline confirmed an R5 virus isolation after 12 months in contrast to 3 out of 7 (43%) of those receiving cART only. After 12 months, only 1 R5X4 HIV-1 isolate was obtained from 21 cART+IL-2-treated individuals infected with an R5 virus at entry (5%) vs. 2/7 (29%) patients receiving cART alone, as confirmed by a 5-year follow-up on some individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent IL-2 administration plus cART may prevent evolution towards CXCR4 usage in individuals infected with R5 HIV-1."
32875867,Predictors of Failure for Nonoperative Management of Spinal Epidural Abscess.,2021,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to identify predictive factors associated with failure of nonoperative management of spinal epidural abscess (SEA). METHODS: Between January 2007 and January 2017, there were 97 patients 18 years or older treated for SEA at a tertiary referral center. Of these, 58 were initially managed nonoperatively. Details on presenting complaint, laboratory parameters, radiographic evaluation, demographics, comorbidities, and neurologic status (Frankel grades A-E) were collected. Success of treatment was defined as eradication of infection with no requirement for further antimicrobial therapy. Diagnosis of SEA was made via evaluation of imaging and intraoperative findings. Patients with repeat presentation of SEA, children, and those who were transferred for immediate surgical decompression were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients initially treated nonoperatively were included. Of these, 21 failed nonoperative management and required surgical intervention. The mean age was 60 years, 66% male, and 19% of Maori ethnicity. Abscess location was predominantly dorsal, and in the lumbar region (53%). Multivariate analysis identified Maori ethnicity, multifocal sepsis, and elevated white cell count as predictors of failure of nonoperative management. With 1 predictor the risk of failure was 44%. In the presence of 2 predictive variables, failure rate increased to 60%, and if all 3 variables were present, patients had a 75% risk of failure. CONCLUSION: Thirty-six percent of patients treated nonoperatively failed nonoperative management-the failure rate was significantly increased in patients with multifocal sepsis, in patients with elevated white cell count, and in patients of Maori ethnicity."
15765014,[Participation of procalcitonin in inflammatory response after cardiovascular surgery].,2004,"Cardiovascular surgery is associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and these patients are recognized to be at increased risk for delayed infectious complications. There is a need for effective and accurate biological and biochemical tests to support, or exclude, the diagnosis of infection. Inflammatory response involves the release of a wide array of mediators, which has led to the suggestion that some of these mediators could be used as markers of infection or sepsis severity. Recently, plasma procalcitonin (PCT) concentration has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of infection. The aim of this work is to review state-of-the-art knowledge about PCT and the role of this peptide as a regulator of immune response after cardiovascular surgery."
41551848,Survival after cardiopulmonary arrest due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis: A case successfully managed using plasma exchange.,2026,"Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis is potentially fatal, even in immunocompetent hosts. This report describes a case involving a 57-year-old woman, who developed fever after a dog bite and initially presented without an evident focus. On the day of admission, she deteriorated to pulseless electrical activity during transport and achieved return of spontaneous circulation after approximately 23 minutes of resuscitation. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials (meropenem) were initiated for septic shock, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus subsequently grew in both the pre-admission and admission blood cultures. Peripheral discoloration suggested purpura fulminans. A precipitous decline in platelet count, schistocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and acute kidney injury fulfilled the criteria for thrombotic microangiopathy, whereas ADAMTS13 activity was normal. Intensive care consisted of red blood cell and platelet transfusions, continuous hemodiafiltration transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, and therapeutic plasma exchange once daily for three sessions. Hematological abnormalities resolved, schistocytes disappeared, organ dysfunction improved, and she was ultimately removed from ventilation and dialysis with full neurological recovery. This report describes survival after cardiopulmonary arrest due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis and suggests that plasma exchange may be a useful adjunct for secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in this setting. Early diagnosis, prompt antibiotic treatment, and multidisciplinary critical care are essential."
15621148,Lethal infection by Candida (Torulopsis) incospicua complicating orthotopic liver transplantation.,2004,"We report here an uncommon case of deep infection by Torulopsis incospicua, associated with multibacterial sepsis and complicated by several mycotic aneurysms of hepatic artery, liver graft necrosis, and hepatic acute failure in a liver orthotopic transplant recipient. Two successive emergency liver transplants were needed, but fast relapses of infection and mycotic aneurysms were experienced. The patient died soon after the third liver transplant; disseminated mycosis was demonstrated by post mortem examination. In conclusion, fungal infection should be considered in cases of spontaneous hepatic artery rupture."
15672716,Widespread and invasive Trichophyton rubrum infection mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with AIDS.,2004,"Opportunistic fungal infections are commonly encountered in AIDS patients. Candidiasis, tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and deep mycotic infections have been the fungal infections most frequently reported in these patients. Dermatophyte infections can appear to be atypical and aggressive in these patients and may lead to a misdiagnosis. We report a Trichophyton rubrum infection in a 44-year-old man with AIDS that presented as a widespread and multiple tumor-like appearance. After the patient was treated with terbinafine for 21 weeks, the lesions cleared completely. We think that this type of dermatophyte infection is very unusual in patients with AIDS and could lead to inappropriate diagnostic processes and treatments."
31810640,Obesity is Associated With Mortality and Complications After Trauma: A State-Wide Cohort Study.,2020,"BACKGROUND: With rising obesity rates in the United States, knowledge of obesity's impact on trauma outcomes is essential to providing high-quality care. The interaction between body mass and outcomes is unclear, with existing literature demonstrating conflicting results. We hypothesized that in a broad cohort of trauma patients, obesity would be associated with in-hospital mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 2014-2015 Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS) registry, a state-wide registry to which all accredited Pennsylvania trauma centers are required to report. We included nonburn adult trauma patients admitted to level I and II centers. Because PTOS lacks height data, weight thresholds of 111.75 kg for men and 95.05 kg for women were used, which correspond to BMI = 30 kg/m(2) at the 99th height percentile in the United States. We tested the association of obesity with in-hospital mortality using logistic regression to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: We included 46,329 patients in a complete case analysis. In univariate logistic regression analysis, injury mechanism, presence of a complication, age, sex, need for blood transfusion, Revised Trauma Score, and Injury Severity Score were associated with mortality. On multivariate analysis, including these factors, obesity was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.69). Respiratory, thromboembolic, and infectious complications, as defined by PTOS, were more common in obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for patient and injury characteristics, obesity is associated with increased mortality following trauma. This information may help resolve previous conflicting evidence and guide providers in caring for the obese patient."
41438687,Updates on the role of miR-193b in the pathogenesis of human cancers and other diseases.,2026,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, fundamentally influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Among these, miR-193b has garnered significant attention as a potent tumor suppressor in some contexts, while functioning as an oncogene in other situations. Its frequent loss in some types of cancers such as gastric and cervical cancers as well as osteosarcoma positions it not only as a valuable prognostic indicator but also as a potential tool for gene therapy. On the other hand, it has been found to be up-regulated in esophageal and bladder cancers. Meanwhile, data regarding its expression pattern in some types of cancers, such as colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers is conflicting. Moreover, its influence extends beyond oncology, implicating it in a diverse range of human diseases, including systemic sclerosis, aortic dissection, osteoarthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis and allergic rhinitis. However, miR-193b does not have a single, unified function; instead, its role is highly context-dependent, acting as either a protective molecule or a pathogenic driver depending on the specific tissue and disease. This review aims to consolidate the current updates on the role of miR-193b, detailing its molecular mechanisms, validated target genes, and its burgeoning potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in cancer and other pathological conditions."
15763731,Characterization of streptococci and enterococci associated with septicaemia in broiler parents with a high prevalence of endocarditis.,2004,"Increased mortality due to septicaemia, where 29% of the affected birds had developed valvular endocarditis, was observed in a flock of broiler parents affected by myelocytomatosis. Bacterial investigations resulted in isolation of streptococci, the classification of which was unknown according to present taxonomy. Strains were isolated from the liver, spleen, heart and salpinx in clinical cases of septicaemia from the affected flock of Ross broiler parents aged between 26 and 56 weeks. Phenotypic characterization followed by genotypic investigation by ribotyping with HindIII and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI demonstrated three ribotypes and six different PFGE profile types, respectively. Ribotype A with variant A1, together with the PFGE profile type represented by the three subtypes Ia, Ib and Ic, dominated the outbreak constituting 85% of the strains investigated, indicating clonality. 16S rRNA sequencing of strains representing this genotype demonstrated the occurrence of a recently described new Streptococcus sp., Streptococcus gallinaceus. Sequence analysis of the other genotypes demonstrated in the outbreak, resulted in identical 16S rRNA sequences to the type strain of Enterococcus faecalis. S. gallinaceus appears to represent a new opportunistic pathogen within the poultry industry."
15604130,Involvement of CB1-receptors and beta-adrenoceptors in the regional hemodynamic responses to lipopolysaccharide infusion in conscious rats.,2005,"A possible involvement of endocannabinoids in a chronic model of endotoxemia was assessed by measuring the regional (renal, mesenteric, hindquarters) hemodynamic responses to continuous 24-h LPS infusion (150 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) in conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats, in the absence or presence of the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist AM-251 (3 mg/kg). AM-251 inhibited the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS, but did not influence the other hemodynamic changes. In subsequent experiments, it was shown that the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were also inhibited by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In addition, the late (at 24 h) hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were inhibited by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551. Against the background of our previous work showing beta-adrenoceptor involvement in the cardiovascular effects of exogenous cannabinoids, we conclude that AM-251 may have been inhibiting endocannabinoid-modulated, sympathoadrenal-mediated activation of vasodilator beta-adrenoceptors in LPS-infused rats rather than suppressing a direct vasodilator action of endocannabinoids."
25600574,Procalcitonin-guided therapy may reduce length of antibiotic treatment in intensive care unit patients with secondary peritonitis: A multicenter retrospective study.,2015,"PURPOSE: Because procalcitonin (PCT) might be surrogate for antimicrobial discontinuation in general intensive care units (ICUs), this study explored its use for secondary peritonitis in 4 surgical ICUs (SICUs). METHODS: A retrospective study including all consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis, controlled infection source, requiring surgery, and at least 48-hour SICU admission was performed (June 2012-June 2013). Patients were divided following notations in medical records into PCT-guided (notation of PCT-based antibiotic discontinuation) and non-PCT-guided (no notation) groups. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients (52 PCT-guided, 69 non-PCT-guided) were included. No differences in clinical scores, biomarkers, or septic shock (30 [57.7%] PCT-guided vs 40 [58.0%] non-PCT-guided) were found. Length of intra-SICU (median, 5.0 days; both groups) or in-hospital (median, 20.0 vs 17.5 days) stay, and mortality intra-SICU (9.6% vs 13.0%), 28-day (15.4% vs 20.3%), or in-hospital (19.2% vs 29.0%) were not significantly different (PCT-guided vs non-PCT-guided). In septic shock patients, no mortality differences were found (PCT-guided vs non-PCT-guided): 16.7% vs 22.5% (intra-SICU), 26.7% vs 32.5% (28-day), and 33.3% vs 42.5% (in-hospital). Treatment was shorter in the PCT-guided group (5.1 +/-2.1 vs 10.2 +/- 3.7 days, P < .001), without differences between patients with and without septic shock. CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin guidance produced 50% reduction in antibiotic duration (P < .001, log-rank test)."

15679627,Role of gamma interferon and T cells in congenital Toxoplasma transmission.,2004,"In the BALB/c mouse model, primary infection with Toxoplasma gondii during the second third of gestation leads to a high percentage of infected foetuses. However, immunity induced by infection contracted before pregnancy prevents parasites from crossing the placenta and completely protects the foetuses, as well as the pregnant women. In order to clarify the roles of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes and IFN-gamma in this protection, pregnant BALB/c mice were treated with depleting monoclonal antibodies against CD4, CD8, IFN-gamma, or control antibody. Only the foetuses of the groups treated with anti-CD8 and anti-IFN-gamma antibodies developed congenital toxoplasmosis. The maternal production of IFN-gamma was depressed in the mice depleted of CD4 and CD8 cells (P < 0.001). Determination of the blood parasite load demonstrated that materno-foetal transmission of T. gondii correlates with maternal parasitaemia. Together, these results show that CD8+ T lymphocytes and IFN-gamma play an important role in protection against congenital toxoplasmosis during reinfection."
31898563,[Experimental study of cardiac function by high-resolution ultrasound in sepsis rats with cecal ligation and puncture].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiac function of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced sepsis rats with high-resolution ultrasound. METHODS: According to the method of random number table, 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal control group and sepsis 6, 12, 24, 30, 48 hours groups, with 8 rats in each group. The sepsis model was produced by CLP, and the rats in the normal control group were only anesthetized and resuscitated. The general situation after modeling in each group was observed, and the left ventricular function was assessed by high-resolution echocardiography at all the time points. The abdominal aorta blood of rats was collected, and the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The myocardial tissue was harvested, and the pathological changes in myocardial tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. RESULTS: The rats challenged to CLP displayed symptoms of sepsis, such as depression, ruffled fur, decreased diet and activity, and the symptoms became more obvious with the extension of time. High-resolution echocardiography could clearly show the structure of left ventricle in each group and obtain satisfactory M-mode echocardiography of left ventricle. The heart rate (HR) of rats in all sepsis groups was elevated with the increase in model time as measured by high-resolution ultrasound, and it was significantly higher than that in the normal control group at 12, 24, 30 hours (bpm: 359.66+/-23.33, 361.35+/-12.85, 392.67+/-11.33 vs. 306.24+/-29.79, all P < 0.05). Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) in sepsis rats were decreased with the increase in model time, while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were increased first and then decreased, and SV and LVEF in sepsis 48 hours group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group [SV (muL): 78.43+/-17.52 vs. 122.61+/-15.88, LVEF: 0.763+/-0.018 vs. 0.902+/-0.011, both P < 0.05]. Left ventricular weight (LVW) in all sepsis groups was increased to different degrees as compared with that in the normal control group, as well as the left ventricular anterior and posterior wall thickness increased in diastole and systole. Compared with the normal control group, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness was increased significantly at the end of diastolic and systolic period in the sepsis 12 hours group, and the left ventricular anterior wall thickness was also increased significantly at the end of diastolic period in the sepsis 48 hours group. The serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and CK-MB in sepsis rats were increased first and then decreased with the extension of model making time. The above parameters in the sepsis 48 hours group were still significantly higher than those in the normal control group [TNF-alpha (ng/L): 61.59+/-3.99 vs. 16.87+/-4.89, IL-1beta (ng/L): 255.03+/-13.23 vs. 119.59+/-10.43, CK-MB (mug/L): 1.27+/-0.15 vs. 0.52+/-0.15, all P < 0.05]. HE staining showed that the myocardial striations of the rats in the normal control group were clear and complete, with normal morphology and orderly arrangement of cardiac cells. However in the sepsis groups, myocardial cells were swollen, ruptured and necrotic, and inflammatory cells were infiltrated, with myocardial fibers ruptured and necrosis dissolved, and the above pathological manifestations gradually increased with the extension of the model making time. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution ultrasound can evaluate the cardiac function of CLP induced sepsis rat model more comprehensive, and the consequence of evaluation index is consistent with the expression level of myocardial enzyme and histopathologic manifestations."
19954920,Infectious complications after elective vascular surgical procedures.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the rates of postoperative infectious complications and death after elective vascular surgery, define vascular procedures with the greatest risk of developing nosocomial infections, and assess the effect of infection on health care resource utilization. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2006) was used to identify major vascular procedures by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Infectious complications identified included pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), postoperative sepsis, and surgical site infections (SSI). Case-mix-adjusted rates were calculated using a multivariate logistic regression model for infectious complication or death as an outcome and indirect standardization. RESULTS: A total of 870,778 elective vascular surgical procedures were estimated and evaluated with an overall postoperative infection rate of 3.70%. Open abdominal aortic surgery had the greatest rate of postoperative infections, followed by open thoracic procedures and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass. Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) infectious complication rates were two times greater than after EVAR (P < .0001). Pneumonia was the most common infectious complication after open aortic surgery (6.63%). UTI was the most common after TEVAR (2.86%) and EVAR (1.31%). Infectious complications were greater in octogenarians (P < .0002), women (P < .0001), and blacks (P < .0001 vs whites and Hispanics). Nosocomial infections after elective vascular surgery significantly increased hospital length of stay (13.8 +/- 15.4 vs 3.5 +/- 4.2 days; P < .001) and reported total hospital cost ($37,834 +/- $42,905 vs $11,851 +/- $11,816; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Elective vascular surgical procedures vary widely in the estimated risk of postoperative infection. Open aortic surgery and endarterectomy of the head and neck vessels have, respectively, the greatest and the lowest reported incidence for postoperative infectious complications. Women, octogenarians, and blacks have the highest risk of infectious complications after elective vascular surgery. Disparities in the development of infectious complications on a systems level were also found in larger hospitals and teaching hospitals. Hospital infectious complications were found to significantly increase health care resource utilization. Strategies that reduce nosocomial complications and target high-risk procedures may offer significant future cost savings."
32166228,Heterogenous Renal Injury Biomarker Production Reveals Human Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Subtypes.,2019,"To identify mechanisms associated with sepsis-acute kidney injury based on the expression levels of renal injury biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule-1 in renal biopsies which may allow the identification of sepsis-acute kidney injury patient subtypes. DESIGN: Prospective, clinical laboratory study using ""warm"" human postmortem sepsis-acute kidney injury kidney biopsies. SETTING: Research laboratory at university teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Adult patients who died of sepsis in the ICU and control patients undergoing tumor nephrectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining were used to quantify messenger RNA and protein expression levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 in the kidney of sepsis-acute kidney injury patients and control subjects. Morphometric analysis was used to quantify renal and glomerular neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 protein levels. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 messenger RNA and protein levels were increased in kidneys of sepsis-acute kidney injury patients compared with control kidney tissue. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was localized in the distal tubules, collecting ducts, the adventitia of the renal arterioles, and in the glomerular tufts of renal biopsies from sepsis-acute kidney injury patients. In contrast, kidney injury molecule-1 was localized at the brush border of the proximal tubules. There was no correlation between neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 levels. Furthermore, renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 levels were not associated with the extent of renal injury, the severity of critical illness, or serum creatinine levels at either ICU admission or day of expiration. By laser microdissecting glomeruli, followed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we identified heterogenous glomerular neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin production in the kidney of sepsis-acute kidney injury patients. CONCLUSION: We found differences in the expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 in patients with the same syndrome ""sepsis-acute kidney injury"" meaning there is no single pathway leading to sepsis-acute kidney injury. This underscores the beliefs that there are many/different pathophysiological pathways that can cause sepsis-acute kidney injury. Hence, patients with criteria that meet the definitions of both acute kidney injury and sepsis can be divided into subtypes based on pathophysiological features."
31805466,"Muscle wasting associated co-morbidities, rather than sarcopenia are risk factors for hospital mortality in critical illness.",2020,"BACKGROUND: Low skeletal muscle mass on intensive care unit admission is related to increased mortality. It is however unknown whether this association is influenced by co-morbidities that are associated with skeletal muscle loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for hospital mortality in critical illness in the presence of co-morbidities associated with muscle wasting. METHODS: Data of 155 patients with abdominal sepsis were retrospectively analyzed. Skeletal muscle area was assessed using CT-scans at the level of vertebra L3. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from electronic patient files. Sarcopenia was defined as a muscle area index below the 5th percentile of the general population. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between sarcopenia and hospital mortality, correcting for age and comorbidities. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in patients that did not survive until hospital discharge. However, it appeared that this relation was confounded by the presence of chronic renal insufficiency and cancer. These were independent risk factors for hospital mortality, whereas sarcopenia was not. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with abdominal sepsis, muscle wasting associated co-morbidities rather than sarcopenia were risk factors for hospital mortality."
25503728,IL-1 receptor blockade alleviates endotoxin-mediated impairment of renal drug excretory functions in rats.,2015,"The aim of our study was to investigate whether two potent anti-inflammatory agents, dexamethasone and anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, may influence acute kidney injury (AKI) and associated drug excretory functions during endotoxemia (LPS) in rats. Ten hours after LPS administration, untreated endotoxemic rats developed typical symptoms of AKI, with reduced GFR, impaired tubular excretion of urea and sodium, and decreased urinary excretion of azithromycin, an anionic substrate for multidrug resistance-transporting proteins. Administration of both immunosuppressants attenuated the inflammatory response, liver damage, AKI, and increased renal clearance of azithromycin mainly by restoration of GFR, without significant influence on its tubular secretion. The lack of such an effect was related to the differential effect of both agents on the renal expression of individual drug transporters. Only dexamethasone increased the urinary clearance of bile acids, in accordance with the reduction of the apical transporter (Asbt) for their tubular reabsorption. In summary, our data demonstrated the potency of both agents used for the prevention of AKI, imposed by endotoxins, and for the restoration of renal drug elimination, mainly by the improvement of GFR. The influence of both drugs on altered tubular functions and the expression of drug transporters was differential, emphasizing the necessity of knowledge of transporting pathways for individual drugs applied during sepsis. The effect of anakinra suggests a significant contribution of IL-1 signaling to the pathogenesis of LPS-induced AKI."
25549679,[Risk factors and prognosis of hypotension in postoperative sedation patients].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors and prognosis of hypotension in postoperative sedation patients. METHODS: A total of 175 patients with postoperative sedation at our department from May 2013 to March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with age <18 years, cardiac surgery, pheochromocytoma surgery, hemorrhagic shock, septic shock or cardiogenic shock were excluded. APACHE II, dosage and duration of sedative drug, mean arterial pressure at baseline and after sedation, central venous pressure, fluid balance, dosage and duration of norepinephrine, endotracheal intubation time and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were recorded. RESULTS: Blood pressures decreased significantly after administration of sedation (77.2 +/- 11.2 vs 82.6 +/- 9.3 mmHg, P = 0.000). Compared to those with lower disease severity (APACHEII </= 10), the patients with APACHEII.>10 required higher norepinephrine dosage and longer time of infusion. A longer time of norepinephrine infusion was needed for patients with coronary heart disease. Patients undergoing thoracic, abdominal or pelvic surgery, or those with hepatic dysfunction had a higher norepinephrine dosage. Decrement of blood pressure and norepinephrine duration were independent risk factors of endotracheal intubation time. And dosage and duration of norepinephrine were independent risk factors of ICU time. CONCLUSION: Disease severity, past history of heart disease, surgical site and liver function are risk factors of hypotension in postoperative sedation patients. It is important to pay attention to dosage and administrative route of sedative drug. Norepinephrine duration after sedation is an independent risk factor of endotracheal intubation time and ICU time."
21138672,[Use of the fluorescent in situ hybridization technique for the rapid identification of staphylococcus aureus in blood cultures].,2009,"BACKGROUND: The technique of reference for the detection of bacteriemia is the blood culture. One of the most frequent bacteria responsible of bacteriemia is Staphylococcus aureus (SAU). The presence of Gram positive cocci (CGPR), in blood culture give the suspicious of bacteriemia, although the relevance of the finding depends on the correct identification of the microorganism. The definitive typification it demands from 24 to 48 hours. The technique of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), is a rapid method for the identification of bacteria in blood culture. AIMS: The aims of this work was to establish the FISH technique directed to the 16S RNA of SAU in samples of blood cultures with CGPR to the Gram staining, to determine the concordance with the method of reference, and to evaluate the possibility to use as standard method in the laboratory of microbiology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The blood cultures analyzed in the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Hospital Privado Cordoba from 01.01.2009 to 31.12.09 were included in this study. To each positive blood culture which showed CGPR was applied simultaneously biochemical identification and FISH. RESULTS: From 496 positive samples, 32 showed CGPR, 24 of them were identified as SAU. A concordance of 100% (IC95% 99 to 100) between both methods of diagnosis, with a value of k<0.01 was observed. DISCUSSION: The excellent concordance opens the prospect for a study in order to determine the predictive value of FISH, its sensibility and specificity. Furthermore, it will be possible to evaluate its clinical impact being incorporated in a laboratory of clinical bacteriology."
32197746,"The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic.",2020,"Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura."
31830996,Elevated MR-proANP plasma concentrations are associated with sepsis and predict mortality in critically ill patients.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mid-regional pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) is an established biomarker for heart failure, based on its key role in regulating homeostasis of water balance and blood pressure. The aim of the study was to determine the value of MR-proANP as a clinical biomarker in critical illness and/or sepsis. Upon admission to the medical intensive care unit (ICU), we investigated MR-proANP plasma concentrations in 217 critically ill patients (144 with sepsis, 73 without sepsis). Results were compared with 65 healthy controls. RESULTS: MR-proANP plasma levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, when compared to healthy controls. Notably, MR-proANP levels were significantly higher in ICU patients with sepsis. MR-proANP levels were not associated with metabolic comorbidities like diabetes or obesity. In critically ill patients, MR-proANP plasma concentrations correlated with inflammatory cytokines, markers of organ dysfunction and several adipocytokines, such as resistin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and adiponectin. Importantly, high MR-proANP plasma levels were associated with mortality, as MR-proANP levels above 227.0 pmol/l indicated a particularly increased mortality risk in ICU patients. The association between MR-proANP and mortality was independent of single organ failure and inflammation markers. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the role of circulating MR-proANP as a biomarker in critically ill patients, in which high MR-proANP indicates organ dysfunction, sepsis and mortality risk. The association between high MR-proANP and inflammatory as well as adipose tissue-derived endocrine mediators warrants further pathophysiological investigations."
25519998,Screening and treatment for Staphylococcus aureus in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance for screening and treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis and colonized by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. The literature search involved the following databases: the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, SciELO, and PubMed/Medline. The descriptors were ""Staphylococcus aureus"", ""MRSA"", ""MSSA"", ""treatment"", ""decolonization"", ""nasal carrier"", ""colonization"", ""chronic kidney disease"", ""dialysis"", and ""haemodialysis"" or ""hemodialysis"". Five randomized controlled trials that exhibited agreement among reviewers as shown by a kappa value of >0.80 were included in the study; methodological quality was evaluated using the STROBE statement. Patients who received various treatments (various treatments group) or topical mupirocin (mupirocin group) were compared with those who received either no treatment or placebo (control group). The outcomes were skin infection at the central venous catheter insertion site and bacteremia. RESULTS: In total, 2374 patients were included in the analysis, 626 (26.4%) of whom were nasal carriers of S. aureus. The probability of S. aureus infection at the catheter site for hemodialysis was 87% lower in the mupirocin group than in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.34; p<0.001). The risk of bacteremia was 82% lower in the mupirocin group than in the control group (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.42; p<0.001). No statistically significant difference in bacteremia was observed between the various treatments group (excluding mupirocin) and the control group (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.51-1.15; p=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six percent of patients undergoing hemodialysis were nasal carriers of S. aureus. Of all treatments evaluated, topical mupirocin was the most effective therapy for the reduction of S. aureus catheter site infection and bacteremia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis."
20037107,Hirudin for management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II in a patient with biventricular assist device support.,2009,"A patient with severe dilated cardiomyopathy developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) after implantation of a biventricular assist device (biVAD). Because the patient showed mild renal dysfunction but severe hepatic impairment, the management of anticoagulation was switched from heparin to the direct thrombin inhibitor hirudin, which was administered by continuous infusion of 0.6 to 1 mg/h. This protocol was monitored by measuring the plasma hirudin level, which ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 microg/mL. Unfortunately, the patient died on day 22 after implantation from fulminant sepsis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Neither thromboembolic events nor thrombocytopenia was observed after hirudin administration. The explanted biVAD showed no thrombotic material in the arterial/venous lines or on the polyurethane valves. We discuss the challenges posed by HIT II complicating VAD support as well as its clinical management with direct thrombin inhibitors."
41429144,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs in sepsis treatment: principles, impact, and future directions.",2026,"Sepsis continues to be a serious global health concern with increasing mortality rates owing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have emerged as critical tools for optimizing antibiotic use and reducing AMR. This review examines the applications of ASPs in sepsis treatment, highlights their role in improving patient outcomes, and addresses the challenges posed by multidrug-resistant organisms. The review begins by exploring the global AMR crisis and its implications for sepsis therapy and then evaluates the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's guidelines and their limitations in the context of growing AMR. The core principles of ASPs in sepsis treatment are also discussed. Data from international and Korean studies indicate that effective ASPs may improve patient outcomes; reduce the length of hospital stay; and reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated adverse events, healthcare costs, and AMR. However, diagnostic delays, staffing shortages, and inconsistent ASP implementation remain significant barriers. Furthermore, robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of ASPs in various patient populations with sepsis is required. This review concludes with the future directions for integrating rapid diagnostics, individualized treatment planning, and informatics. To ensure responsible antibiotic use in sepsis care in increasing resistance, investment in and engagement with ASPs must be increased."
31915722,"SIRS Triggered by Acute Right Ventricular Function, Mimicked Septic Shock.",2019,"BACKGROUND: The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a complex immune response which can be precipitated by non-infectious aetiologies such as trauma, burns or pancreatitis. Addressing the underlying cause is crucial because it can be associated with increased mortality. Although the current literature associates chronic heart failure with SIRS, acute right ventricular dysfunction has not previously been reported to trigger SIRS. This case report describes the presentation of acute right ventricular dysfunction that triggered SIRS and mimicked septic shock. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old male presented to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with elevated inflammatory markers and refractory hypotension after a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical choledochectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy. Septic shock was misdiagnosed, and he was later found to have a pulmonary embolus. Thrombectomy and antimicrobials had no significant efect on lowering the elevated inflammatory markers or improving the persistent hypotension. Through Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS), right ventricular dysfunction was diagnosed. Treatment with intravenous milrinone improved blood pressure, normalised inflammatory markers and led to a prompt discharge from the ICU. CONCLUSION: Acute right ventricular dysfunction can trigger SIRS, which may mimic septic shock and delay appropriate treatment."
41422470,Meningococcal Disease in Older Adults: Challenges in Diagnosis and Management.,2026,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in older adults frequently presents with atypical clinical manifestations, including bacteremic pneumonia, often without classical meningeal signs or sepsis, which presents clinicians with diagnostic challenges, and may delay treatment, which contributes to the high mortality observed in older adults. Within the broader resurgence of IMD observed since relaxation of quarantine measures introduced to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable increase in reporting of such atypical cases. The aim of this review is to summarize epidemiological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of non-meningeal forms of IMD in older patients, with a focus on meningococcal pneumonia. By convention, laboratory confirmation requires N. meningitidis detection by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or antigen detection. In most cases, presentation of meningococcal pneumonia is similar to that of other forms of community-acquired pneumonia, and cerebrospinal fluid sampling may be non-informative. This places a premium on early blood culture for N. meningitidis, allied with testing of respiratory samples (e.g., broncho-alveolar washes). Many cases are linked to isolates of serogroups Y and W. When confirmed, treatment with third-generation cephalosporins is generally preferred. Chemoprophylaxis and vaccination of close contacts is essential for controlling onward meningococcal disease transmission and prevention of further cases."
20061679,Trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood in Jakarta from 2002 to 2008.,2009,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream to antimicrobials with the aim of providing information relevant to the guidance of therapy. METHODOLOGY: Blood specimens received by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. RESULTS: During the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of Gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. The eight most frequent species found were Acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (8%), Salmonella Typhi (7.5%), Escherichia coli (6.2%), Alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). At 80% susceptibility or greater, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime were active only on E. coli and S. Typhi. Cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except K. pneumonia while Amikacin showed activity against five species, A. faecalis, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and S. Typhi. Gentamycin was active against three species: E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and S. Typhi. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while Ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and S. Typhi ), Levofloxacin was similar to Cefepime and was active against all eight species except K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Since antimicrobials are broadly used in Jakarta, it is important that the information captured in this study be disseminated."
31864802,Unusual extra-podal fungal mycetoma with black grains in a Senegalese child.,2020,"Mycetoma remains endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of the ""mycetoma belt"" including Senegal. It affects more commonly young men in the age group of 20 to 40 years. The foot represents the most commonly affected site. The most common extra-podal localizations are leg, knee, buttocks, hand and arm. We report an exceptional case of cervical fungal mycetoma that occurred in a 13-year-old Senegalese child. He consulted for a cervico-submandibular tumefaction with multiple sinuses and black grains discharge evolving since 6 years, associated to laryngeal dyspnoea. Mycological examination with culture isolated Madurella mycetomatis. Cervical CT Scan showed bone and soft tissue invasion. Terbinafine alone was administered. During the evolution, tracheotomy was performed following the aggravation of the laryngeal disorders. Death from severe sepsis occurred after 8 months of evolution. The particularities of our case are the occurrence of fungal mycetoma in a child, the cervical localization and the difficulties of therapeutic management largely due to the diagnostic delay."
25503977,"VWF excess and ADAMTS13 deficiency: a unifying pathomechanism linking inflammation to thrombosis in DIC, malaria, and TTP.",2015,"Absent or severely diminished activity of ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with a ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13) resulting in the intravascular persistence and accumulation of highly thrombogenic ultra large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers is the pathophysiological mechanism underlying thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Reduced VWF-cleaving protease levels, however, are not uniquely restricted to primary thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), e. g. thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, but also occur in other life-threatening thrombocytopenic conditions: severely decreased ADAMTS13 activity is seen in severe sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and complicated malarial infection. The clinical relevance of these secondary thrombotic microangiopathies is increasingly recognised, but its therapeutic implications have not yet been determined. The presence of a secondary TMA in certain diseases may define patient groups which possibly could benefit from ADAMTS13 replacement or a VWF-targeting therapy. This short-review focuses on the role of UL-VWF multimers in secondary TMA and discusses the potential of investigational therapies as candidates for the treatment of TTP. In conclusion, prospective clinical trials on the effectiveness of protease replacementin vivo seem reasonable. Carefully selected patients with secondary TMA may benefit from therapies primarily intended for the use in patients with TTP."
25499413,"Combination of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, early lactate area, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide levels as a predictor of mortality in geriatric patients with septic shock.",2015,"BACKGROUND: Given the high mortality rates in elderly patients with septic shock, the early recognition of patients at greatest risk of death is crucial for the implementation of early intervention strategies. Serum lactate and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels are often elevated in elderly patients with septic shock and are therefore important biomarkers of metabolic and cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that a risk stratification system that incorporates the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and lactate and NT-proBNP biomarkers would better predict mortality in geriatric patients with septic shock than the APACHE II score alone. METHODS: A single-center prospective study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2013 in a 30-bed intensive care unit of a triservice hospital. The lactate area score was defined as the sum of the area under the curve of serial lactate levels measured during the 24 hours following admission divided by 24. The NT-proBNP score was assigned based on NT-proBNP levels measured at admission. The combined score was calculated by adding the lactate area and NT-proBNP scores to the APACHE II score. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate which variables and scoring systems served as the best predictors of mortality in elderly septic patients. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients with septic shock were included in the study. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 67.0%. When compared to survivors, nonsurvivors had significantly higher lactate area scores, NT-proBNP scores, APACHE II scores, and combined scores. In the multivariate regression model, the combined score, lactate area score, and mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors associated with death. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the combined score had significantly greater predictive power when compared to the APACHE II score or the NT-proBNP score (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A combined score that incorporates the APACHE II score with early lactate area and NT-proBNP levels is a useful method for risk stratification in geriatric patients with septic shock."
33086954,Erosive polyarthritis caused by sepsis due to a novel species of Streptobacillus notomytis.,2020,"Rat-bite fever (RBF) is characterized by fever, rash and arthritis, mainly caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis. We present a case of inflammatory erosive polyarthritis with sepsis caused by Streptobacillus notomytis, a novel species isolated from S. moniliformis. A 67-year-old man presented with fever, purpura and peripheral arthritis. After blood cultures were performed, loxoprofen administration was initiated. Arthritis partially improved, but left first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) arthritis persisted. A gram-negative rod was detected in the blood culture, and meropenem administration was started that improved arthritis. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed bone erosion in the left first MTP joint, leading to the diagnosis of septic arthritis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that this strain was S. notomytis. Further questioning revealed the patient may have had contact with rats. It is essential to consider Streptobacillus infection in the differential diagnosis of erosive polyarthritis."
25657603,"Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of cirrhosis-associated cardiomyopathy in liver transplant candidates: advanced echo imaging, cardiac biomarkers, and advanced heart failure therapies.",2014,"Patients with end-stage liver disease in need of liver transplantation increasingly are older with a greater burden of cardiac disease and other co-morbidities, which may increase perioperative risk and adversely affect long-term prognosis. Cirrhosis of any etiology manifests hemodynamically as a state of low systemic vascular resistance, with high peripheral, but low central blood volume, leading to a state of neurohormonal activation and high cardiac output, which may adversely affect cardiac reserve under extreme perioperative stress, aptly termed cirrhosis-associated or cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Evidence of asymptomatic cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may be found in subtle electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes, but may progress to severe heart failure under the demands of bleeding and transfusions, vasopressors, rebounding peripheral vascular resistance, withdrawal of cardioprotective beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists, exacerbated by sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This review will add to the current body of literature on cirrhotic cardiomyopathy by focusing on the role of advanced echocardiographic imaging techniques, cardiac biomarkers, and advanced heart failure therapies available to manage patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy while waiting for liver transplant and during the perioperative period."
25867578,Clinical Factors Associated with Morbidity and Mortality in Patients Admitted with Sickle Cell Disease.,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical factors associated with the length of hospitalization and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: All patients with SCD admitted to the medical wards of the University Hospital of the West Indies, Jamaica, over a five-year period, January 1 to December 31, 2010, were reviewed. Data were extracted from hospital charts and comprised demographic and clinical information, investigations, interventions, duration of stay, pathological data and outcomes. RESULTS: There were 105 patients reviewed; 84% were genotype Hb SS. Females accounted for 59% and males 41%. Overall mean age was 32.5 years (SD 13.7, range 12-66 years). The mean length of hospitalization was 10.2 days (SD 10.9, range 1-84 days). The main admission diagnoses were painful crisis, acute chest syndrome, severe anaemia, sepsis, hepatic sequestration, congestive cardiac failure and renal failure. The mean value for the following laboratory investigations were: haemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (SD 2.8), total white blood cell count 21.7 x 109/L (SD 14.2), platelet count 320 x 109/L (SD 191.9), blood urea 9.8 mmol/L (SD 11.9) and serum creatinine 198 umol/L (SD 267.9). Medical interventions included: blood transfusions in 20.9%, 55% received antibiotics and 74% received narcotic analgesia. There were 40 deaths with four autopsies done. The mortality rate for SCD was 38%. There were 189 repeat SCD admissions. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease still carries a high morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to hospital. Recurrent admissions are a concern, as they impact on patient's morbidity and quality of life."
41431373,How to screen and provide rapid initial treatment for sepsis in adult patients.,2026,"Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition in which a dysregulated host response to infection causes organ dysfunction, potentially leading to death. It is a time-critical condition, so early recognition of deterioration potentially due to sepsis, escalation to a senior clinician and rapid initial treatment are key for improving outcomes and saving lives. Nurses screening patients for sepsis must have the knowledge and skills required to do so effectively, working within their level of competence. * Sepsis is a life-threatening and time-critical condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. * To ensure comprehensive and accurate screening, it is recommended to use an early warning score observation chart and a sepsis screening tool. * The 'sepsis six' is a bundle of six activities that must be carried out to improve patient outcomes when sepsis is suspected. REFLECTIVE ACTIVITY: 'How to' articles can help to update your practice and ensure it remains evidence-based. Apply this article to your practice.

20003096,Predicting the advent of ascites and other complications in primary biliary cirrhosis: a staged model approach.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Current survival models for primary biliary cirrhosis have limited precision for medium and long-term survival. Aim To describe a prognostic model for the advent of complications in primary biliary cirrhosis as the first approach to a staged prognostic model. METHODS: From an established database of 289 consecutive primary biliary cirrhosis patients referred to Royal Free Hospital over 12 years (mean follow-up of 4.1 years), baseline characteristics at referral were evaluated by Cox-proportional hazards regression modelling. RESULTS: The following complications occurred de novo: 85 ascites/peripheral oedema, 40 oesophagogastric varices, 63 encephalopathy, 29 spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or septicaemia, 59 symptomatic urinary tract infections. Age, albumin, log(10)(bilirubin), presence of ascites at referral, variceal bleeding within 6 weeks before referral, detection of oesophagogastric varices at or before referral were significant at multivariate analysis with different combinations and coefficients for each complication. The model for predicting ascites and/or peripheral oedema best fitted the observed data (ROC = 0.7682, S.E. = 0.0385). CONCLUSIONS: The known prognostic factors in primary biliary cirrhosis also model the advent of complications. In view of the prognostic importance of ascites and its more robust statistical model, ascites and/or peripheral oedema could represent, following validation, the most suitable staged model in primary biliary cirrhosis to improve precision in survival modelling."
15650866,A 12-month clinical survey of incidence and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in Shanghai intensive care units.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate incidence, causes, and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) in Shanghai. DESIGN: A prospective 12-month survey during 2001-2002 of the predispositions, clinical management strategies, complications, and 90-day survival rates of patients with ARDS. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Fifteen ICU in 12 university hospitals in Shanghai. All ICU admissions >/=15 years of age in the 12-month period were assessed. Patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria of ARDS, as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference, and having a continuous treatment period >/=24 h, were recruited. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of 5320 adult patients admitted to ICUs, there were 108 (2%) with ARDS. At inclusion, ARDS patients had a mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) value of 111.3+/-40.3 mmHg and a mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score (APACHE II) of 17.3+/-8.0; 33 patients had a lung injury score >2.5. Forty-one and 67 patients had ARDS associated with diseases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin, respectively. The most common predisposing factors for ARDS were pneumonia (34.3%) and nonpulmonary sepsis (30.6%). The overall ICU mortality was 10.3%. In-hospital and 90-day mortalities of ARDS patients were 68.5 and 70.4%, respectively, and accounted for 13.5% of the overall ICU mortality. For ARDS patients, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was a major risk factor associated with death (59.5%). CONCLUSION: The high morbidity and mortality of ARDS in the ICUs in Shanghai require reassessment of respiratory and intensive care management and implementation of effective therapeutic interventions."
25672219,Diagnostic accuracy of delirium diagnosis in pediatric intensive care: a systematic review.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Delirium is common in adult intensive care, with validated tools for measurement, known risk factors and adverse neurocognitive outcomes. We aimed to determine what is known about pediatric delirium in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for and review of studies of the accuracy of delirium diagnosis in children in the PICU. Secondary aims were to determine the prevalence, risk factors and outcomes associated with pediatric delirium. We created screening and data collection tools based on published recommendations. RESULTS: After screening 145 titles and abstracts, followed by 35 full-text publications and reference lists of included publications, 9 reports of 5 studies were included. Each of the five included studies was on a single index test: (1) the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED; for ages 1 to 17 years), (2) the Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (p-CAM-ICU; for ages >/= 5 years), (3) the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAP-D; a modification of the PAED designed to detect hypoactive delirium), (4) the revised Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAP-D(R)) and (5) clinical suspicion. We found that all five studies had a high risk of bias on at least one domain in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Sample size, sensitivity, specificity, and effectiveness (correct classification divided by total tests done) were: PAED 144, 91%, 98%, <91% (>16% of scores required imputation for missing data); p-CAM 68, 78%, 98%, 96%; CAP-D 50, 91%, 100%, 89%; CAP-D (R) 111, and of assessments 94%, 79%, <82% (it is not clear if any assessments were not included); and clinical suspicion 877, N/A (only positive predictive value calculable, 66%). Prevalence of delirium was 17%, 13%, 28%, 21%, and 5% respectively. Only the clinical suspicion study researchers statistically determined any risk factors for delirium (pediatric risk of mortality, pediatric index of mortality, ventilation, age) or outcomes of delirium (length of stay and mortality). CONCLUSION: High-quality research to determine the accuracy of delirium screening tools in the PICU are required before prevalence, risk factors and outcomes can be determined and before a routine screening tool can be recommended. Direct comparisons of the p-CAM-ICU and CAP-D(R) should be performed."
41462176,Maternal mortality in Ethiopia (2015-2025): a systematic review of recent evidence and determinants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Despite major policy reforms and improvements in healthcare coverage, maternal mortality remains a critical public health burden in Ethiopia. While progress has been made since the Millennium Development Goals era, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) still exceeds national and global targets. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from the past decade (2015-2025) to describe the magnitude, determinants, and regional disparities of maternal mortality in Ethiopia, highlighting persistent challenges and future priorities. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)), we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and African Journal Online(AJOL), supplemented with grey literature from World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health. Studies published in English between January 2015 and September 2025 was included. Data extraction followed standardized templates, and study quality was appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tools. Given methodological heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis approach was applied. RESULTS: A total of 61 studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing all Ethiopian regions. The pooled MMR was estimated at 366.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, showing only modest progress from previous decades. The leading causes of maternal death were obstetric hemorrhage (29.6%), hypertensive disorders (22.1%), sepsis (14.8%), obstructed labor (11.3%), and unsafe abortion (8.5%). Determinants aligned with the three-delay model: (1) delayed decision-making from low awareness and sociocultural barriers; (2) delayed access due to distance, transport, and cost; and (3) delayed care from health-system shortages and weak referral mechanisms. Socioeconomic inequality, inadequate antenatal care (< 4 visits), rural residence, and low maternal education consistently increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality in Ethiopia remains unacceptably high yet preventable. Persistent inequities, poor service quality, and health-system gaps continue to drive maternal deaths. Despite national initiatives such as the Health Sector Transformation Plan II (2015-2025) and the Maternal and Child Health Roadmap, progress is uneven. Achieving the SDG 3.1 target of < 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 demands stronger referral systems, equitable resource distribution, and quality-focused maternal health interventions. Targeted regional interventions and stronger Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) readiness are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3.1 target. Future research should integrate longitudinal, spatial, machine learning and Bayesian models to pinpoint high-risk areas and evaluate the impact of health-system reforms."
31830394,[Economic impact of kidney patients with sepsis in hospital setting].,2019,"Introduction: Over the last decades, sepsis has become a real medical emergency, with a high mortality rate and often requiring admission to an intensive care unit. An increasing number of CKD patients contracts sepsis due to several clinical risk factors (use of catheters, immunosuppressive therapy, comorbidity, etc.) and is treated in Nephrology wards, generating additional costs that are not covered by hospital Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) reimbursement. The aim of the study is to evaluate the costs of sepsis in one Nephrology Unit and to detect the mortality rate of CKD patients with sepsis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of CKD patients admitted into one Nephrology Unit in 2017. CKD inpatients were divided in two groups: patients with sepsis (SP) and without (control group). Socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic data, as well as routine biochemistry, were collected through a ""sepsis form"". SP were identified thanks to hospital discharge records (HDR). The hospital-related costs of a SP were obtained by summing up: (1) the average cost of an inpatient day of care for the average length of stay in the Nephrology Unit; (2) the average cost of the antimicrobial therapy, as recorded on the clinical folder. Results: Among the 408 CKD inpatients, 61 were septic. The overall average cost of a SP was 23.087,57 euro; the average cost of the hospital stay and of the antimicrobial therapy was 19.364,98 euro and 3.722,60 euro respectively. The average length of stay in the Nephrology Unit was 16.7 days. The in-hospital mortality rate was 41.7%, with a 312% additional mortality rate. Conclusions: SP had an overall average cost three times higher than CKD inpatients without sepsis (9.290,79 euro). This additional cost was due to a longer hospital stay (8.7 days more on average) and a higher cost of antimicrobial therapy per case (euro 221,24). A national multi-centre study is needed to confirm our data and to promote an adjustment of reimbursement tariff for DRG-sepsis, which is now applicable only to an ICU setting."
20044628,"Docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin (DIP) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin have all shown activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The optimal combination of the three drugs is, however, unknown. Considering the favorable results of taxane-containing triplets as induction chemotherapy in locally advanced (LA) SCCHN, DIP (docetaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin) was studied in this setting as part of a phase I dose- and sequence-exploring study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: D (60 or 75 mg/m(2)) was given by 60-min infusion on day 1, I (1000 mg/m(2)/day), with mesna until 12 hours after I, by 24-h infusion days 1-5, and P (50 or 75 mg/m(2)) by 24-h infusion on days 1 or 5. The cycles were repeated every 21 days. Toxicities according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 (NCI-CTC2) were evaluated weekly and response was evaluated every 2 cycles according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Thereafter, radiotherapy (RT, cumulative dose 70 Gy) or chemoradiation (CRT), both with conventional fractionation, were planned. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (18 male, 4 female; age 41-66 years, performance status 0-1, 2 T4N0, 3 T3N2, 11 T4N2, 3 T unknown N3, 1 T1N3 and 2 T4N3) received a median of 4 DIP cycles (range 1-5). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 18 patients, grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia in 5 and 1 patients, respectively, and grade 3 anemia in 5 patients. Gastrointestinal and mucosal toxicities were generally mild/moderate. Vascular complications (probably not DIP-related) precluded local treatment in two patients. Moreover, one patient died on day 13 of the first DIP (neutropenic sepsis and myocardial infarction). The remaining patients received RT (n=2) or CRT (n=17; 16 of these with gemcitabine). The response to 2 x DIP was 95% (1 complete response, 19 partial responses, 1 stable disease); the complete response rate increased to 42% after 4 x DIP. No dose or sequence effect was evident. The minimum follow-up of the surviving patients was 51 months, with median relapse-free survival of 13.8 months and median overall survival of 18.8 months. Only four patients relapsed at distant sites. CONCLUSION: DIP is highly active in previously untreated LA SCCHN, however, toxicity of DIP in this population is substantial."
16206969,Deep venous thrombosis in children and adolescents.,2004,"OBJECT: The objective of this retrospective review was to identify patients on the pediatric neurosurgical ward with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) to develop diagnostic and treatment-related guidelines. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all cases of DVT presenting to the Children's Hospital between March 1986 and February 1997. Of 32 patients identified, 14 were followed by the neurosurgical service. Current records were additionally evaluated to assess follow-up condition in the patients as well as outcome. Variables included diagnosis, race, age, follow-up duration, outcome, presenting signs/symptoms, involved vessel(s), concurrent disease, diagnostic modalities, and treatment. Patient age ranged from 1 to 16 years (mean 12.6 years, median 15 years). There were five girls and nine boys. Eight DVTs were right sided and six were left sided. Presenting symptoms included swelling of the affected extremity in 11 patients, pain in five, erythema in one, and cardiopulmonary arrest in two. Comorbidities included previous orthopedic procedures in three, brain tumors in two, and sepsis, fracture, pulmonary disease, preexisting coagulation disorders, and brain abscess in one patient each. Eight patients presented with a history of trauma. Two patients had undergone chemotherapy. Diagnostic studies included ultrasonography and venography in one, venography alone in two, computerized tomography (CT) scanning and venography in one, tagged red blood cell studies in one, ultrasonography and CT scanning in one, and ultrasonography alone in eight. In one patient an inferior vena cava filter was placed and one patient was treated with oral warfarin alone. One patient with a brain tumor died while hospitalized. In four patients there was evidence of rheumatological disease in the group of patients not treated neurosurgically. Two patients suffered recurrences during the follow-up period (mean 20 months) In the entire series of 32 patients there were five total deaths. Of these, two patients experienced six recurrences each, and one other patient suffered four recurrences. Of note, none of the recurrences was observed in patients with underlying coagulation disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Children with DVT can experience serious complications in the form of both morbidity and mortality. Although most thrombotic complications have been found in patients with femoral lines, prolonged treatment involving a central line has been found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Multiple treatment modalities currently exist for children with DVT. Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy has many benefits over unfractionated heparin agents and may be more appropriate for the prophylaxis or treatment of children and adolescents with DVT because of its acceptable safety and efficacy. Clinical data for neonates and young children remain incomplete."
15684803,Clostridium septicum bacteremia without gas gangrene as a late consequence of a contaminated wound.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium septicum is an unusual human pathogen associated with colorectal malignancy and gas gangrene. METHODS: A case compilation and literature review are presented. RESULTS: We report the case of an individual with a comminuted tibial fracture complicated by a superficial surgical site infection with C. septicum nine weeks after the original injury and internal fixation, which was complicated by a secondary bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case in the literature, but it is suggested that the use of cephalosporins as prophylaxis for contaminated wounds may be inferior to penicillins to prevent clostridial infections."
19940554,The complications of septic arthritis in the elderly.,2010,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An epidemiological analysis of cases of spontaneous community acquired septic arthritis in an elderly population at a university teaching hospital. METHODS: Confirmed cases of spontaneous septic arthritis in the over-65 population were studied. Patients with prosthetic joint infections were excluded from the study. Analysed data included initial presenting complaint and clinical examination, hematological and microbiological tests together with ultimate patient outcome. RESULTS: There were 7 confirmed cases of spontaneous septic arthritis in the over 65 population in the past 6 months (2 hips, 5 knees). The mean age was 72.14 (range 65-82) with a mean length of stay of 49 days. Those with septic arthritis of the knee presented with swelling, pain and immobility. Hip cases presented with pain and immobility. All patients were systemically well at the time of presentation, with no other foci of infection detected after septic screening. All patients had confirmed aspirate and arthroscopic/arthrotomy infection. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 6 joint aspirations and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa from one patient. Complications of treatment included acute renal failure, cardio/respiratory failure, disseminated infection, and death (1 case). CONCLUSION: Septic arthritis must be considered as a differential diagnosis in all patients with joint pain, swelling and immobility. This diagnosis is not confined to the pediatric population. A background of degenerative disease and occult presentation in the elderly may delay diagnosis. Sepsis must be considered in the elderly with joint pathology, and treatment must be initiated in a prompt and aggressive manner, to prevent sequelae."
25555659,Antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term premature rupture of membranes: metaanalysis of randomized trials.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in women with term or near-term premature rupture of membranes. STUDY DESIGN: Searches were performed in MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, ScienceDirect.com, MEDSCAPE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the use of a combination of key words and text words related to antibiotics, premature rupture of membranes, term, and trials from inception of each database to September 2014. We included all randomized trials of singleton gestations with premature rupture of membranes at 36 weeks or more, who were randomized to antibiotic prophylaxis or control (either placebo or no treatment). The primary outcomes included maternal chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis. A subgroup analysis on studies with latency more than 12 hours was planned. Before data extraction, the review was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42014013928). The metaanalysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. RESULTS: Women who received antibiotics had the same rate of chorioamnionitis (2.7% vs 3.7%; relative risk [RR], 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.12), endometritis (0.4% vs 0.9%; RR, 0.44, 95% CI, 0.18-1.10), maternal infection (3.1% vs 4.6%; RR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.19-1.21), and neonatal sepsis (1.0% vs 1.4%; RR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.34-1.39). In the planned subgroup analysis, women with latency longer than 12 hours, who received antibiotics, had a lower rate of chorioamnionitis (2.9% vs 6.1%; RR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.27-0.91) and endometritis (0% vs 2.2%; RR, 0.12, 95% CI, 0.02-0.62) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term premature rupture of membranes is not associated with any benefits in either maternal or neonatal outcomes. In women with latency longer than 12 hours, prophylactic antibiotics are associated with significantly lower rates of chorioamnionitis by 51% and endometritis by 88%."
25506497,Acute osteomyelitis as cause of late sepsis in a nigerian neonate.,2014,"Neonatal osteomyelitis (NO) is said to be rare and uncommonly reported in the sub-region. Although this may be true, either because the cases are under-diagnosed, unreported or under-reported. The diagnosis is clinical and supported with blood culture or the aspiration of pus with radiological findings. We report a case of a neonate with acute osteomyelitis of the right femur, diagnosed at 10(th) day of life, which was confirmed with blood culture and radiogram findings of the right upper thigh of the baby. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented reported case of NO from the south-eastern Nigeria. It is imperative to recognize the clinical presentation necessary to raise the suspicion of NO and other focal infection in the newborn. With thorough examination and selected investigation the focus of infection in the neonate can be detected."
41421176,The diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin for sepsis in critically ill adults. A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Procalcitonin (PCT) has been a blue-eyed-boy in diagnosing sepsis in previous years. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis, according to the recent Sepsis-3 criteria, in adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We searched several electronic databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from the inception of the Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria (January 1, 2016) until May 31, 2025, for randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PCT for sepsis using the Sepsis-3 criteria among critically ill adult patients with suspected infection. We performed a random effect diagnostic meta-analysis, evaluated the risk of bias of individual studies using the QUADAS tool, and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: We included 10 studies comprising 1098 patients. Of these, 635 patients were diagnosed with sepsis based on Sepsis-3 criteria, including 89 patients with septic shock. The pooled sensitivity of PCT for diagnosing sepsis was 0.72 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 0.68-0.75, low certainty) and the pooled specificity was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.61-0.69, low certainty). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 2.45 (95 % CI [confidence interval], 1.62-3.68), The negative likelihood ratio was 0.38 (95 % CI, 0.28-0.53), and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 7.08 (95 % CI, 3.69-13.58). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of PCT was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.73-0.86). CONCLUSION: Based on pooled analysis, PCT has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of sepsis in ICU patients with suspected infection. These results suggest clinicians should be cautious about using PCT to facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults with suspected infection. Given the ongoing uncertainty, further high-quality data in this population is needed."
16010094,The relationship between preoperative serum immunoglobulin levels and the development of bacteremia after tonsillectomy.,2004,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the risk for the development of bacteremia during tonsillectomy and evaluated the presence of an association between bacteremia and preoperative serum immunoglobulin levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 40 patients (16 males, 24 females; mean age 16.8 years; range 5 to 35 years) who underwent tonsillectomy with the use of the dissection-snear technique. Preoperatively, venous blood samples were collected from all the patients to determine serum immunoglobulin levels and the presence or absence of bacteremia. Bacteremia was also investigated in blood samples postoperatively. RESULTS: There was no growth in the preoperative blood cultures, but bacteremia was documented in 10 patients (25%) after tonsillectomy. Increased serum IgG levels were determined in 15 patients before operation, seven of whom developed bacteremia after tonsillectomy (p<0.05). There was no correlation between postoperative bacteremia and preoperative serum IgM or IgA levels (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Although our current knowledge does not allow to predict bacteremia following tonsillectomy in advance, the finding that seven of 10 patients who developed bacteremia had increased preoperative IgG levels draws attention to serum IgG, especially in patents in whom bacteremia may present additional risks."
41538518,In vitro and in vivo studies on the activity and selectivity of butoconazole in experimental infection by Trypanosoma cruzi.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (CD). There are two drugs available for the treatment with limited efficacy, especially in the later stage. Focusing on drug repurposing by virtual screening of chemical databases, butoconazole (BTZ) was identified as promising hit. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore the trypanosomicidal effect of BTZ alone or in combination with benznidazole (BZ) against T. cruzi. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our in vitro assays validated the low cytotoxicity of BTZ and high potency on amastigotes (EC50 = 0.07 muM), being 24-fold more potent than BZ. Washout assays demonstrated the sterilisation capacity of BTZ, whereas its combination with BZ gave an additive interaction (xƩFICI = 0.66). In a mouse model of acute T. cruzi infection, BTZ was unable to suppress parasitaemia but ensured the animal survival. BTZ plus BZ reduced parasitaemia and provided higher survival rates than monotherapies. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that BTZ + BZ protocol gave 100% of lack of parasitological cure, as parasite satDNA was amplified in the heart of all surviving animals. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our dataset reinforces the relevance of drug repurposing and combination strategies to advance into the development of novel therapeutic approaches for CD."
25531715,Usefulness of estimation of blood procalcitonin concentration versus C-reactive protein concentration and white blood cell count for therapeutic monitoring of sepsis in neonates.,2014,"AIM: This study was intended to assess the clinical usefulness of blood procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of nosocomial neonatal sepsis. MATERIAL/METHODS: The enrolment criterion was sepsis clinically manifesting after three days of life. PCT concentrations were measured in venous blood from 52 infected and 88 uninfected neonates. The results were interpreted against C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and white blood cell counts (WBC). RESULTS: Differences between the two groups in PCT and CRP concentrations were highly significant. No significant differences between the groups were noted for WBC. The threshold value on the receiver operator characteristic curve was 2.06 ng/mL for PCT (SE 75%; SP 80.68%; PPV 62.22%; NPV 88.75%; AUC 0.805), 5.0 mg/L for CRP (SE 67.44%; SP 73.68%; PPV 42.02%; NPV 88.89%; AUC 0.801), and 11.9 x109/L for WBC (SE 51.16%; SP 50.68%; PPV 23.16%; NPV 78.13%; AUC 0.484). Procalcitonin concentrations decreased 24 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy and reverted to the control level after 5-7 days. C-reactive protein concentrations began to decline after two days of antibiotic therapy but were still higher than in the control group after 5-7 days of treatment. No significant changes in WBC during the treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin concentrations in blood appear to be of use for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of nosocomial infections in neonates as this parameter demonstrates greater sensitivity and specificity than C-reactive protein. White blood cell counts appear to be of little diagnostic value in the early phase of infection or for therapeutic monitoring."
26407369,A Case of Adenovirus Viremia in a Pediatric Liver Transplant Recipient With Neutropenia and Lymphopenia: Who and When Should We Treat?,2015,"Human adenovirus (HAdV) is one of the most feared infections among immunocompromised patients. In particular, in liver transplant patients, HAdV has been implicated in acute liver failure with resultant mortality. The development of current molecular techniques and surveillance testing protocols have provided tools for early detection of HAdV infection, prior to or at the early onset of HAdV disease. Although reduction in immune suppression is the mainstay of therapy, many researchers have also advocated for early administration of antiviral therapy. In multiple reports, cidofovir treatment has been associated with declines in HAdV viral loads or clinical improvement in solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients. However, there have also been case reports that raise questions about the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in controlling systemic HAdV disease. We report a case of a 26-month-old male recipient of a liver transplantation for hepatoblastoma who developed adenoviremia with an associated hepatitis and gastroenteritis. He recovered with reduced immune suppression but without antiviral therapy, thus avoiding potential toxicities associated with cidofovir therapy. This case a contrast to previous reports, and it highlights the ambiguity regarding which patients should receive HAdV-specific antiviral therapy. Additional knowledge regarding specific pediatric host factors and HAdV factors that predict poor outcomes are needed. Such information would allow clinicians to better stratify patients by risk at the time of adenoviremia detection so that low-risk patients are not unnecessarily exposed to medications with potential toxicities."
19957192,Outbreak of Candida parapsilosis in a neonatal intensive care unit: a health care workers source.,2010,"Nosocomial neonatal candidiasis is a major problem in infants, which require intensive therapy. The subjects of the present study were three preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the General Hospital ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"". The infants developed Candida parapsilosis infection on the mean age of 13.6 day of life. Prior to fungemia, infants had received assisted ventilation and hyperalimentation through central venous catheter. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer gene ruled out other Candida species and revealed that the eight isolates were C. parapsilosis. The isolates were examined based on their molecular relation by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. The profiles allowed the identification of two main genotypes of C. parapsilosis as the outbreak cause and as a result of the cross-infection with health care workers' hands. We conclude that C. parapsilosis commonly colonize through horizontal transmission due to the staff's noncompliance of hand hygiene procedures."
25550504,Activated CD4+CCR5+ T cells in the rectum predict increased SIV acquisition in SIVGag/Tat-vaccinated rhesus macaques.,2015,"An effective T-cell-based AIDS vaccine should induce strong HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in mucosal tissues without increasing the availability of target cells for the virus. Here, we evaluated five immunization strategies that include Human adenovirus-5 (AdHu5), Chimpanzee adenovirus-6 (AdC6) or -7 (AdC7), Vaccinia virus (VV), and DNA given by electroporation (DNA/EP), all expressing Simian immunodeficiency virus group specific antigen/transactivator of transcription (SIV(mac239Gag/Tat)). Five groups of six rhesus macaques (RMs) each were vaccinated with DNA/EP-AdC6-AdC7, VV-AdC6-AdC7, DNA/-EP-VV-AdC6, DNA/EP-VV-AdC7, or AdHu5-AdHu5-AdHu5 and were challenged repeatedly with low-dose intrarectal SIVmac239. Upon challenge, there were no significant differences among study groups in terms of virus acquisition or viral load after infection. When taken together, the immunization regimens did not protect against SIV acquisition compared with controls but did result in an  approximately  1.6-log decline in set-point viremia. Although all immunized RMs had detectable SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in blood and rectal mucosa, we found no correlation between the number or function of these SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells and protection against SIV acquisition. Interestingly, RMs experiencing breakthrough infection showed significantly higher prechallenge levels of CD4(+)C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells in the rectal biopsies (RB) than animals that remained uninfected. In addition, among the infected RMs, the percentage of CD4(+)CCR5(+)Ki-67(+) T cells in RBs prechallenge correlated with higher early viremia. Overall, these data suggest that the levels of activated CD4(+)CCR5(+) target T cells in the rectal mucosa may predict the risk of SIV acquisition in RMs vaccinated with vectors that express SIVGag/Tat."
20011882,Outcomes of aortic coarctation surgical treatment in adults.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe our experience in aortic coarctation surgery in adult patients by assessing the immediate and mid-term outcomes. METHODS: From January 1987 to March 2000, 50 consecutive adult patients underwent surgery for correction of aortic coarctation, through left lateral thoracotomy. Of these, forty two (84%) patients presented high blood pressure, with mean systolic arterial pressure of 170.56 mmHg (125-220 mmHg). The mean of pressure gradient in the coarctation area was 51.4 mmHg (18-123 mmHg). Other associated surgical cardiovascular diseases were not treated in the same operative act, except in two cases of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Three different techniques were used: aortic coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 20 (40%) patients, coarctation enlargement with bovine pericardial patch was performed in 22 (44%) patients and synthetic tube interposition was performed in eight (16%) patients. RESULTS: Operative morbidity was low; there was one case of bleeding who required reoperation. The most common immediate postoperative event was high blood pressure (98%), but it was easily controlled by intravenous drugs. There was no hospital death. Mean residual pressure gradient was 18.7 (8-33 mmHg). Patients were discharged in 9.5 days (5-30). Postoperative follow-up mean was 46.8 months (1-145 months) in 45 (91.8%) patients. Forty one (91.1%) of these followed-up patients had normal blood pressure, whereas 75.6% of them without drugs intake. 93.3% of these followed-up patients were asymptomatic. Four of them required further surgical operation, one needed a pacemaker implant, other two patients needed a cardiac valve replacement and one had endocarditis. There was one related death due to sepsis secondary to endocarditis. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of aortic coarctation, even in adult patients, is an efficient therapeutic choice, regardless of the applied surgical technique, with low morbidity and mortality. It reduces efficiently the arterial pressure levels in both immediate and mid-term follow-up."
19955599,[Laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The new gold standard for bladder carcinoma?].,2009,"SUMMARY OBJECTIVES: The experience of a renowned Latin American laparoscopic center is reported and the differences with the open technique are thoroughly discussed. METHODS: During a 7 year period a total of 85 laparoscopic cystectomies were performed; in 92%of the cases urinary diversion was performed extracorporeally. This accounted for: 14 anterior exanterations, 50 radical cystoprostatectomies, 7 radical cystectomies and 14 simple cystectomies. Male to female ratio was 3:1. Mean patient age was 63 years (range 29 to 83). Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 28 kg/m2(range 20 to 47). Operative data and long term results are analyzed. RESULTS: All 85 procedures were completed laparoscopically without need for conversion to open surgery. Orthotopic neobladder, Santiago pouch, Studer, Fontana and Le Bag were performed in 42, 13, 16, 12 and 1 case respectively. Ileal conduit, Indiana pouch and Mainz II were employed in 24, 10 and 9 cases respectively. All Mainz II were performed intracorporeally. Mean operative time and blood loss were 279 minutes (range 180 to 375) and 436 ml (range 50 to 1.500) respectively. A total of 8 patients (11%) presented perioperative complications: 5 vascular lesions, 2 eviscerations and 2 septicemias. Delayed complications were observed in 7 cases (9%); 3 urinary sepsis, 1 ureteral stenosis, 2 spontaneous ruptures and 1 mesenteric ischemia. Mean hospital stay was 8.8 days (range de 4 to 28). There was no operative mortality. Mean follow-up was 18 months (range 2 to 68 months). Ten patients (13%) presented disease progression and death. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy is associated with diminished operative bleeding, time to oral intake and hospital stay. Though this is a reproducible technique it demands a very long learning curve."
15931355,Soluble form of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 as a marker of microbial infection.,2004,"Sepsis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for diagnosing sepsis as clinical and laboratory signs are neither sensitive enough nor specific enough, and microbiological studies often remain negative. Thus, there is a need for clinical or laboratory tools to distinguish between sepsis and non-infectious inflammatory disorders. Among the potentially useful markers of sepsis, procalcitonin has been suggested to be the most promising, although results are variable depending on the severity of illness and degree of infection in the patient population studied. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, of which expression is upregulated on phagocytic cells in the presence of bacteria or fungi. Here we report on the potential usefulness of assessing the soluble form of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) in biological fluids for the diagnosis of microbial infection."
26078662,The importance of administration of early surfactant and nasal continuous positive airway pressure in newborns with respiratory distress syndrome.,2014,"AIM: Mechanical ventilation is an invasive method and causes to important problems in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma. The objective of our study was to investigate if administration of early surfactant and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) was superior to delayed surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in the Van 100th Year University, Medical Faculty Hospital, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. One hundred and nine infants with respiratory distrss syndrome (RDS) with a gestational age of 32 weeks and/or below were included in the study. Surfactant was given to 61 infants in the delivery room or intensive care unit and subsequently nCPAP was administered. Surfactant was administered in 48 infants in the control group and mechanical ventilation was inititated subsequently. Informed consent was obtained from the relatives of all patients and ethics committee approval was also obtained (Approval number: 03.02.2011/15). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of gestational age, birth weight, gender, height and head circumference measurements (p>0.05). The mean hospitalization time in the patients in the study group was 24.4+/-17.8 days, whereas the mean time of nCPAP was 28.4 (4-120) hours. In the study group, intracranial hemorrhage was found with a rate of 27.85%, bronchopulmonary dysplasia was found with a rate of 4.91%, pneumothorax was found with a rate of 3.27%, necrotizing enterocolitis was found with a rate of 3.27%, patent ductus arteriosus was found with a rate of 16.39, sepsis was found with a rate of 22.95% and retinopathy of prematurity was found with a rate of 1.63%. No statistically significant difference was found between the study and control groups in terms of the rates of complications. During the follow-up period, 17 (27.86%) patients were lost. The length of stay on mechanical ventilation in the study group was found to be statistically significantly shorter compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, it was observed that administration of early surfactant and nCPAP in treatment of preterm newborns with a diagnosis of RDS markedly decreased the lenght of stay on mechanical ventilation, but had no significant impact on morbidity and mortality."
25672138,[The characteristics of urinary tract infection with urosepsis].,2014,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequently complicated with bacteremia. Many cases of this infection are diagnosed and treated by general practitioners. We retrospectively exam- ined the characteristics of UTIs presenting with urosepsis. METHODS: We assigned 57 UTI patients into two groups according to the results of the blood cultures. Patients were admitted to the Department of General Practice at Sakai City Hospital from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. We investigated the medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: 22 patients presented with urosepsis and 35 did not. Urosepsis in the patients was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus and ureteral stones (diabetes: 32 vs. 3%, p = 0.004; ureteral stone: 23 vs. 3%, p = 0.03). Nausea or vomiting and hydronephrosis were seen in about one half of the patients with urosepsis and were significantly more frequent (nausea or vomiting: 45 vs. 17%, p = 0.03; hydronephrosis: 36 vs. 11%, p = 0.04). Leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count > 12,000/gL) or leukopenia (WBC count < 4,000 /muL) were significantly more frequent (68% vs. 29%) but no significant association was found between urosepsis and body temperature or C-reactive proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Nausea or vomiting, ureteral stones or hydronephrosis, diabetes mellitus and leukocytosis or leukopenia had significantly higher rates in the patients with urosepsis."
20014620,[Local control treatment of bacteria found present in an infected bed sore by means of a hydropolymer dressing with ionic silver].,2009,"Every chronic wound has microorganisms present on its surface and therefore, its contamination is universal and unavoidable, but the majority of these wounds are not infected. It is important, therefore, to refine the diagnosis of infection indentifying the microorganisms which have succeeded in gaining access to the submarginal tissues in order to be able to prevent unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic treatment and to lessen possible complications. A high level of bacteria present, close to 105 ""UFC"" per gram of tissue, even though this does not manifest a clinical infection, might interfere with the repair mechanisms and impede cicatrization of the wound. Due to this difficulty to identify in a precise manner the microorganisms which cause an infection, those patients who have sepsis related to bed sores are habitually treated empirically with wide spectrum range antibiotics, potentially more toxic and often more expensive. But it is important to restrict the use of local antibiotics when treating chronic wounds and to prioritize the use of cleaning methods and diverse debridement methods in order to lower the presence of bacteria. The use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to precise indications, considering that today we have at our disposal alternate treatments with topical antibiotics, principally dressings which contain silver."
25522739,CD4+ lymphocyte adenosine triphosphate--a new marker in sepsis with acute kidney injury?,2014,"BACKGROUND: AKI frequently develops in sepsis patients, significantly decreasing the overall prognosis. There are currently no diagnostic markers available which reliably predict the prognosis of sepsis-associated AKI. Recently, ATP content of CD4+ T cells (ATP_CD4) has been shown to correlate with survival in sepsis. The aim of the study was to determine ATP_CD4 in sepsis-associated AKI. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with sepsis were prospectively analyzed for ATP_CD4 at three different time points. Results were related to survival, renal recovery, and further clinical/laboratory findings. RESULTS: ATP_CD4 tended to lower in concentration at 48 h after onset of sepsis in those patients with complete renal recovery. There were no differences between patients with no AKI and those with AKI of different severity (AKIN 1-3). Urinary NGAL did not correlate with renal prognosis. CONCLUSION: ATP_CD4 may serve as risk predictor in sepsis-associated AKI. Lower concentrations may indicate a higher chance of complete renal recovery in sepsis."
25525303,GSK-3beta inhibition attenuates CLP-induced liver injury by reducing inflammation and hepatic cell apoptosis.,2014,"Liver dysfunction has been known to occur frequently in cases of sepsis. Excessive inflammation and apoptosis are pathological features of acute liver failure. Recent studies suggest that activation of glycogen synthase kinase- (GSK-) 3beta is involved in inflammation and apoptosis. We aimed to investigate the protective effects of GSK-3beta inhibition on polymicrobial sepsis-induced liver injury and to explore the possible mechanisms. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and SB216763 was used to inhibit GSK-3beta in C57BL/6 mice. GSK-3beta was activated following CLP. Administration of SB216763 decreased mortality, ameliorated liver injury, and reduced hepatic apoptosis. The inhibition of GSK-3beta also reduced leukocyte infiltration and hepatic inflammatory cytokine expression and release. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition suppressed the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) but enhanced the transcriptional activity of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the liver. In in vitro studies, GSK-3beta inhibition reduced inflammatory cytokine production via modulation of NF-kappaB and CREB signaling pathways in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. In conclusion, these findings suggest that GSK-3beta blockade protects against CLP-induced liver via inhibition of inflammation by modulating NF-kappaB and CREB activity and suppression of hepatic apoptosis."
31826269,Translational Research in Intensive Care Unit: Novel Approaches for Drug Development and Personalized Medicine.,2019,"The major clinical presentations seen by critical care physicians are sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), both of which are heterogeneous clinical syndromes rather than specific diagnoses. The current diagnostic criteria provide little insight into the mechanisms underlying these heterogeneous syndromes and minimal progress has been made with regard to the development of therapies, despite many large randomized controlled trials being undertaken. This review outlines the advances made in improved characterization of critically-ill patients, using ARDS as an exemplar, and highlights the need for this improved patient characterization to be coupled with mechanistic science to develop therapies that target specific pathomechanisms."
41444646,"""Bifidobacterium longum-reactive T helper cells as marker for intestinal barrier impairment in ICU patients with sepsis"".",2025,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness often leads to the development of intestinal dysbiosis, which can have a significant impact on disease outcome. Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a common problem in intensive care unit patients, particularly those with sepsis. Despite its importance, early and reliable diagnosis of barrier dysfunction and evaluation of therapeutic options remain lacking in clinical practice. Given that intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased translocation of luminal antigens and subsequent priming of naive T cells, we hypothesized that analysis of circulating peripheral antigen-reactive T cells could provide insight into the functionality of the intestinal barrier. RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, 70 ICU patients were enrolled, including those with sepsis, those not meeting sepsis criteria, and COVID-19 patients, as well as 20 healthy volunteers. We identified a sepsis-specific T-helper cell signature in peripheral blood using the antigen-reactive T-cell enrichment (ARTE) technique followed by flow cytometric analysis. This signature was characterized by an expansion of gut trophic Bifidobacterium longum-reactive T-helper cells, indicating significant intestinal barrier dysfunction during sepsis. CONCLUSION: This approach allows the study of intestinal barrier functionality and provides a means to monitor the effects of potential therapeutic interventions over time using blood samples."
15591740,Attenuation of leukocyte sequestration by selective blockade of PECAM-1 or VCAM-1 in murine endotoxemia.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms regulating leukocyte sequestration into the tissue during endotoxemia and/or sepsis are still poorly understood. This in vivo study investigates the biological role of murine PECAM-1 and VCAM-1 for leukocyte sequestration into the lung, liver and striated skin muscle. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with murine PECAM-1 IgG chimera or monoclonal antibody (mAb) to VCAM-1 (3 mg/kg body weight); controls received equivalent doses of IgG2a (n = 6 per group). Fifteen minutes thereafter, 2 mg/kg body weight of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin was injected intravenously. At 24 h after the endotoxin challenge, lungs, livers and striated muscle of skin were analyzed for their myeloperoxidase activity. To monitor intravital leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, fluorescence videomicroscopy was performed in the skin fold chamber model of the BALB/c mouse at 3, 8 and 24 h after injection of endotoxin. RESULTS: Myeloperoxidase activity at 24 h after the endotoxin challenge in lungs (12,171 +/- 2,357 mU/g tissue), livers (2,204 +/- 238 mU/g) and striated muscle of the skin (1,161 +/- 110 mU/g) was significantly reduced in both treatment groups as compared to controls, with strongest attenuation in the PECAM-1 IgG treatment group. Arteriolar leukocyte sticking at 3 h after endotoxin (230 +/- 46 cells x mm(-2)) was significantly reduced in both treatment groups. Leukocyte sticking in postcapillary venules at 8 h after endotoxin (343 +/- 69 cells/mm2) was found reduced only in the VCAM-1-mAb-treated animals (215 +/- 53 cells/mm2), while it was enhanced in animals treated with PECAM-1 IgG (572 +/- 126 cells/mm2). CONCLUSION: These data show that both PECAM-1 and VCAM-1 are involved in endotoxin-induced leukocyte sequestration in the lung, liver and muscle, presumably through interference with arteriolar and/or venular leukocyte sticking."
15776862,[A predictive model of mortality in the ICU of a Mexico City hospital].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations of mortality with routine logbook information as a preliminary to developing a quality control system in an ICU. METHODS: The ICU logbook contained seven variables of 2,745 consecutive cases hospitalized from Jan-01-1998 to Dec-31-2002. The univariate association of ICU mortality with five predictive and two non-predictive variables was explored. Gender was the only one unassociated. A logistic regression predictive model of mortality of three variables was generated (cause of hospitalization, age and type of patient). RESULTS: The global mortality was 27%. The highest risk was for non-surgery patients aged 80+ years with multiple organic failure, sepsis and/or pneumonia. They had a relative risk of 18.1 versus the reference group (surgical cases aged 20-39 with less severe illnesses). Three additional simple predictors were identified as potentially useful and are to be included in an updated logbook. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The logbook information appeared to be useful in monitoring ICU quality of service as six logbook variables were associated to mortality. 2. Our predictive model has the potential to operate as an index of severity of disease and may improve by the inclusion of additional information. 3. Its usefulness is to be compared prospectively with well-established predictors (Apache II and others)."
25542336,[Etiology and clinical course of urinary tract infections in infants less than 3 months-old].,2015,"BACKGROUND: Infants less than 3 months of age with urinary tract infection are usually hospitalized. Recent studies show that a less aggressive management for those patients aged >/= 29 days may be feasible. OBJECTIVES: To determine the complication rate in infants<3 months of age with urinary tract infection, and to identify the causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on infants<3 months of age with positive urinalysis results, together with a positive urine culture from a catheterized specimen and seen in the Emergency Department from 2007 to 2012. Demographics, clinical and microbiology (microorganism isolated and antibiotic susceptibility) data were collected. The complications rate (bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, renal abscess, surgical intervention, Intensive Care Unit admission, or death) were calculated for the overall sample and for different age groups (<29, 29-60, and 61-90 days). RESULTS: A total of 460 patients are included; 137 (29.8%)<29, 166 (36.1%) 29-60, and 157 (34.1%) 61-90 days of age. Twenty four (5.4%; 95% CI: 3.6-7.8) had bacteremia; 15 (10.9%; 95% CI: 6.7-17.3) were<29 days; 8 (4.9%; 95% CI: 2.5-9.4) were 29-60 days, and one (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.1-3.7) was 61-90 days of age (P<.001). One neonate (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.1-4.1) had bacterial meningitis, and 2, renal abscess. Escherichia coli was the common pathogen identified (87.2%) in the urine culture, with a susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate, gentamicin, and cefixime of 89.2, 97.0, and 96.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Complications are low in infants<3 months of age with UTI, especially in those >/= 29 days of age. The identification of patients at very low risk for complications would allow a less aggressive management. Escherichia coli antibiotic susceptibility remains stable, but continuing careful surveillance is essential to optimize empirical antibiotic treatment."
15631315,Cardiac surgical treatment of the patients with renal insufficiency.,2004,"Cardiac surgical treatment of the patients with renal insufficiency became more frequent necessity. Also postoperative renal insufficiency occurs pretty often after cardiac surgery. That is in part a result of broadening of operative indications, which might concern patients with multiple diseases. Patients with renal insufficiency and coexistent heart diseases, patients with endocarditis and patients with renal insufficiency after cardiac surgery require the treatment of cardiac surgeons and nephrologists. Heart diseases are the main cause of the mortality in the dialysis patients. Among the patients with renal diseases the cardiac surgeon most often receive long-term dialysis patients with coexistent heart diseases, who needs cardiac surgery (coronary artery by-pass grafting, valve operations). The amount of these operations increases, however it does not exceed 1% of overall number of cardiac operations. This group however, is very exacting and carries a high operative risk. Dialysis patients are exposed to increased risk of infection. 75% of them reveal infections in the form of sepsis. The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream increase the risk of infectious endocarditis. 6% of dialysis patients with IE require surgery. The prevention of renal failure after cardiac surgery is also very important. Renal insufficiency occurs in 12% of patients after cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal circulation. Renal failure complicates postoperative course and is of high risk for the patient. The mortality due to acute postoperative renal failure, which requires hemofiltration, reaches 70%. The proper cardiac surgical and nephrological management of renal insufficiency in patients selected for cardiac surgery as well as in patients with postoperative renal insufficiency is necessary to obtain good operative results."
15602668,Long-term follow-up of Epstein-Barr virus viremia in pediatric recipients of renal transplants.,2005,"The common observation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia in pediatric recipients of renal transplants and the occurrence of an EBV-related pulmonary leiomyoma prompted us to intensify the follow-up of EBV infections from 1995 to October 2000. Follow-up included serology and detection of viral DNA in blood using a semi-quantitative nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and later a real-time PCR with higher sensitivity. The aim of this study was the early detection of primary infections or reactivations. We obtained 250 samples from 32 patients. EBV DNA detection was consistently negative in 14 patients. There were 5 patients that were considered at risk for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, as they were EBV seronegative and were given a kidney from a positive donor. Of these, 4 had at least one episode of high-level EBV viremia. During these episodes, an absence of noticeable symptoms that could be related to EBV was noted for all but 1 patient. This child presented with severe neutropenia 1 month after grafting and, 28 months later, several nodules of pulmonary leiomyoma, which were found to be EBV related. Four episodes of high-level viremia were observed before the discovery of the leiomyoma. Viral DNA detection is important for the follow-up of such patients that are especially at risk of serious complications of EBV infections."
19958532,Hemostasis during low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation for continuous venovenous hemofiltration: a randomized cross-over trial comparing two hemofiltration rates.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Renal insufficiency increases the half-life of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Whether continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) removes LMWHs is unsettled. We studied hemostasis during nadroparin anticoagulation for CVVH, and explored the implication of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). METHODS: This cross-over study, performed in a 20-bed teaching hospital ICU, randomized non-surgical patients with acute kidney injury requiring nadroparin for CVVH to compare hemostasis between two doses of CVVH: filtrate flow was initiated at 4 L/h and converted to 2 L/h after 60 min in group 1, and vice versa in group 2. Patients received nadroparin 2850 IU i.v., followed by 380 IU/h continuously in the extracorporeal circuit. After baseline sampling, ultrafiltrate, arterial (art) and postfilter (PF) blood was taken for hemostatic markers after 1 h, and 15 min, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after converting filtrate flow. We compared randomized groups, and 'early circuit clotting' to 'normal circuit life' groups. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were randomized, seven to each group. Despite randomization, group 1 had higher SOFA scores (median 14 (IQR 11-15) versus 9 (IQR 5-9), p = 0.004). Anti-Xa art activity peaked upon nadroparin bolus and declined thereafter (p = 0.05). Anti-Xa PF did not change in time. Anti-Xa activity was not detected in ultrafiltrate. Medians of all anti-Xa samples were lower in group 1 (anti-Xa art 0.19 (0.12-0.37) vs. 0.31 (0.23-0.52), p = 0.02; anti-Xa PF 0.34 (0.25-0.44) vs. 0.51 (0.41-0.76), p = 0.005). After a steep decline, arterial ETPAUC tended to increase (p = 0.06), opposite to anti-Xa, while postfilter ETPAUC increased (p = 0.001). Median circuit life was 24.5 h (IQR 12-37 h). Patients with 'short circuit life' had longer baseline prothrombin time (PTT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), lower ETP, higher thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and higher SOFA scores; during CVVH, anti-Xa, and platelets were lower; PTT, aPTT, TAT and D-dimers were longer/higher and ETP was slower and depressed. CONCLUSIONS: We found no accumulation and no removal of LMWH activity during CVVH. However, we found that early circuit clotting was associated with more severe organ failure, prior systemic thrombin generation with consumptive coagulopathy, heparin resistance and elevated extracorporeal thrombin generation. ETP integrates these complex effects on the capacity to form thrombin. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT00965328."
25604112,[Diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin in identifying the etiology of non-responding community-acquired pneumonia after initial antibiotic therapy].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: This study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin(PCT) in identifying the etiology of non-responding community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after initial antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 232 hospitalized CAP patients admitted to the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University during June 2013 and January 2014. Early treatment failure was defined as the presence of persistent fever (>38  degrees C) and/or clinical symptoms (malaise, cough, expectoration, dyspnea) or deterioration after at least 72 h of initial antimicrobial treatment, or development of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or septic shock. Bronchoscopy or transthoracic lung biopsy was performed in case of early treatment failure when indicated. Serum level of PCT was detected by double antibody sandwich method. The differences between 2 or more groups were compared using 2-independent student t test, one-way ANOVA; Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, or chi(2) test. Risk factors and odds ratios for nonresponsiveness were analyzed by setting up a Logistic regression model. The diagnostic values of PCT were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves). RESULTS: Of the 232 CAP patients enrolled, 124 were male and 108 were female, with an average age of (46 +/- 20) years. Thirty-six patients failed to respond to the initial antibiotic therapy. As shown by Logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for treatment failure included hypoalbuminemia, type 2 diabetes, previous history of splenectomy , PSI 4-5 grade, and lung infiltration >/= 3 lobes. The most common causes of non-responsiveness were antimicrobial insufficiency (n = 23), and misdiagnosis of noninfectious mimics of pneumonia (n = 11), with 2 cases of unidentified etiology. The serum PCT level in admission was 0.19 (0.07-0.66) microg/L in the antimicrobial insufficiency subgroup, which was significantly higher than that in the misdiagnosis subgroup [0.06(0.05-0.08)microg/L; P < 0.01]. The antimicrobial insufficiency subgroup included 11 cases of bacterial infection (5 of G(+) cocci and 6 of G(-) bacilli) and 12 cases of nonbacterial infection; their PCT levels were 0.66(0.19-5.80) microg/L and 0.08(0.05-0.20) microg/L, respectively (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference among PCT levels of the 4 subgroups of nonbacterial infections (4 tuberculosis, 3 fungi, 3 atypical pathogens, 2 viruses) (F = 3.025, P = 0.094). The cut-off values of PCT were >0.13 microg/L and >0.115 microg/L for differentiating non-responsiveness originated from bacterial infection or other causes, and infection vs non-infection, which yielded a sensitivity of 100% (11/11) and 65% (14/23) , specificity of 83% (19/23) and 91% (10/11) , and AUC of 0.955 and 0.802, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic failure to cover the microbial pathogens, infectious complications and misdiagnosis are the most common causes of early treatment failure in patients with CAP. Serum PCT level fails to predict non-responsiveness, but is suggestive of bacterial infections in hospitalized CAP patients with early treatment failure."
31843281,The association of burn patient volume with patient safety indicators and mortality in the US.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical volume has been associated with rate of complications and mortality for various conditions and procedures. We aim to analyze the relationship between annual hospital burn admission, patient safety indicators (PSI), line infections, and inpatient mortality. We hypothesize that high facility volume will correlate with better outcomes. METHODS: All burn admissions with complete data for total body surface area (TBSA) and depth were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002-2011. Predictor variables included age, gender, comorbidities, %TBSA, burn depth, and inhalation injury. Surgically relevant PSIs were drawn from the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project and included: sepsis, venous thromboembolic disease, hemorrhage, pneumonia, and wound complications. Outcomes were analyzed with regression models. RESULTS: Of the 57,468 encounters included, 3.1% died, 6.3% experienced >1 PSI event, and 0.3% experienced a catheter-associated urinary tract infections or central line associated blood stream infections. The most frequent PSI was pneumonia followed by sepsis and VTE. Annual hospital burn admission volume was independently associated with decreased odds of mortality (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-0.99, p < 0.001) and PSIs (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-0.99, p = 0.031). There was no significant correlation with line infections. In both mortality and PSI models, age, %TBSA, inhalation injuries, and Elixhauser comorbidity score were significantly associated with adverse outcomes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a significant association between higher hospital volume and decreased likelihood of patient safety indicators and mortality. There was no observed relationship with line infections. These findings could inform future verification policies of US burn centers."
41409941,Study of a Semi-quantitative Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Procalcitonin Detection in Postpartum Sepsis Diagnosis.,2025,"Introduction Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge, causing millions of deaths annually and highlighting the urgent need for rapid diagnostic tools. This study evaluated the performance of a semi-quantitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for procalcitonin (PCT) detection in postpartum sepsis diagnosis, addressing the critical need for point-of-care testing (POCT) in resource-limited settings. Methods A prospective, single-center validation study was conducted with 59 postpartum women enrolled from routine postpartum checkups. The study population included 25 healthy controls, 20 postpartum women without sepsis, and 14 with confirmed sepsis. All participants underwent PCT testing using both the semi-quantitative LFIA and reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Analytical performance parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and clinical correlation, were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal cut-off values. Results The PCT LFIA demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 96.2% (95% CI: 88.2%-99.4%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CI: 87.5%-99.8%) at a cut-off of 0.5 ng/mL. The assay showed strong correlation with reference ELISA methods (r > 0.97) and maintained precision with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 3.2% to 6.5% and inter-assay variation from 4.6% to 8.9%. The limit of detection (LoD) was 0.5 ng/mL with a limit of quantification (LoQ) of 1.0 ng/mL. Postpartum women with sepsis showed significantly elevated PCT levels compared to healthy controls and those without sepsis. Conclusion The semi-quantitative PCT LFIA offers a promising, cost-effective tool for rapid sepsis diagnosis in postpartum women. The assay's high sensitivity and specificity, combined with its point-of-care applicability, make it particularly valuable for improving maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings where timely sepsis diagnosis is crucial."
41461258,Carbapenem resistant gram negative bacteremia in intensive care unit patients: Development and validation of a nomogram-based 30-day mortality risk prediction model.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bloodstream infections (CR-GNB BSIs) are increasingly prevalent in intensive care units (ICUs) and associated with high mortality. Accurate early risk stratification tools are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To develop and internally validate a nomogram-based model predicting 30-day mortality in ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs at a tertiary hospital in western Turkey (January 2020-October 2024). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were collected. Patients were randomly split into training (70 %) and validation (30 %) cohorts. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified independent mortality predictors, which were incorporated into a nomogram. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision-curve utility were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients were included (median age 66 years; 60.9 % male); 30-day mortality was 58 %. Acinetobacter spp. predominated (51.6 %), followed by Klebsiella spp. (42.3 %) and Pseudomonas spp. (6.1 %). Independent predictors of 30-day mortality included older age, immunosuppression, hypoalbuminemia, elevated white blood cell count, and absence of microbiological cure. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC 0.895 training; 0.854 validation), good calibration (mean absolute error 0.022-0.059), and meaningful clinical net benefit across intermediate risk thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated a nomogram using routine clinical and laboratory variables to predict 30-day mortality in ICU patients with CR-GNB BSIs. This tool may support early prognostic assessment at bedside and guide individualized management. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted."
25581534,Vaccination in HIV positive adults: need to address.,2014,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) continues to be a major public health program. Without treatment, average survival time without treatment after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. Vaccination recommendations are determined by weighing the benefits of vaccination against the risks. It is preferable to have patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to receipt of vaccination, as that may help blunt or eliminate vaccine-associated viremia and potentially improve immune response to vaccination. : Although data are limited, in general, HIV-infected individuals who are on ART with well-controlled HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts of >200 cells/muL (or = 15%) may receive indicated live-virus vaccines. Vaccination can play a vital role in enhancing the immunity against opportunistic infections. Further research, is the need for a better and healthy living of the people with HIV."
20042310,"A phase II study of cetuximab, capecitabine and radiotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer.",2010,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) reduces local tumor recurrence in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). This phase II study assessed neoadjuvant cetuximab with capecitabine-based CRT in LARC. METHODS: Patients with stage II/III LARC received capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily for 2 weeks followed by intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) at week 3, then weekly intravenous 250 mg/m(2) cetuximab plus CRT including capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily (including weekends during radiotherapy) with radiotherapy of 45 Gy (25 x 1.8 Gy), 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Total mesorectal excision was scheduled 4-6 weeks following completion of CRT. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were eligible for safety and efficacy. TMN staging at baseline was: T4N2, 11%; T3N2, 40%; T2N2, 3%; T3N1, 35%; T2N1, 3% and T3N0 8%. The most common adverse events included, grade 1/2 acneiform skin rash (86%), and grade 3 radiodermatitis, (16%), diarrhea (11%) and hypersensitivity (5%). pCR was achieved in 3 patients (8%). Overall-, T- and N-downstaging rates were 73%, 57% and 81% respectively. Total sphincter preservation rate was 76%, and 53% in 17 patients whose tumors were located within 5 cm from the anal verge. Non-fatal perioperative complications occurred in 13 patients (35%) with delayed wound healing occurring in 6 patients (16%). One death was recorded due to sepsis following colonic necrosis. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant cetuximab with capecitabine-based CRT is tolerable in patients with resectable LARC. Whilst the pCR rate was similar to recent reports, a high pathological downstaging rate was achieved."
25790504,"First report of a Klebsiella pneumoniae ST466 strain causing neonatal sepsis harbouring the blaCTX-M-15 gene in Rabat, Morocco.",2015,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the Gram-negative bacilli most commonly found in urine of pregnant women and causing neonatal sepsis. The aim of this study was to analyse in terms of epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates collected from vaginal swabs or urine of pregnant women, from pharyngeal and ear swabs of apparently healthy newborns and from peripheral cultures and hemocultures of newborns with suspected invasive neonatal infection in Rabat, Morocco. The prevalence of K. pneumoniae was 0.6 and 0.9% among pregnant women and neonates, respectively. These strains showed lower antimicrobial resistance levels regarding the developed countries. Thus, only one strain from a neonate presented an ESBL. This is the first report of a K. pneumoniae strain causing neonatal sepsis harbouring the blaCTX-M-15 gene in an IncFII plasmid and belonging to ST466 in this area."
25541104,sTREM-1 predicts intensive care unit and 28-day mortality in cancer patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: The innate immune response molecules and their use as a predictor of mortality in cancer patients with severe sepsis and septic shock are poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the value of interleukin (IL)-1ss, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (sTREM-1), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) as predictors of mortality in cancer patients with severe sepsis and septic shock compared with septic patients without malignancies. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary level adult intensive care unit (ICU). SUBJECTS: Seventy-five patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, 40 with cancer and 35 without. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: Laboratory data were collected at ICU admission, 24 and 48 hours after. Plasma concentrations of HMGB-1 and sTREM-1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array. RESULTS: Intensive care unit mortality in cancer and noncancer patients was 40% and 28.6% (P = .29), and 28-day mortality was 45% and 34.3% (P = .34). Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ss, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-alpha showed significantly higher values in the cancer group. Interleukin-10 at 48 hours (P = .01), sTREM-1 in all measurements (P < .01) and HMGB-1 at 24 hours (P < .01) showed significantly lower values in the cancer group. In addition, for the cancer group, sTREM-1 at 24 hours (P = .02) and 48 hours (P = .01) showed higher levels in nonsurvivors patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting ICU mortality for sTREM-1 was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.89; P = .01). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the days spent in mechanical ventilation and levels of sTREM-1 and IL-1ss at 48 hours were independent predictors of ICU mortality; corticosteroids requirement and levels of sTREM-1 and TNF-alpha at 24 hours were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer have different immune profile in sepsis when compared with patients without cancer, as demonstrated for levels of cytokines, sTREM-1 and HMGB-1. sTREM-1 and days spent in mechanical ventilation proved to be good predictors of ICU and 28-day mortality in cancer patients."
31818332,Plasma sTNFR1 and IL8 for prognostic enrichment in sepsis trials: a prospective cohort study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Enrichment strategies improve therapeutic targeting and trial efficiency, but enrichment factors for sepsis trials are lacking. We determined whether concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1), interleukin-8 (IL8), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) could identify sepsis patients at higher mortality risk and serve as prognostic enrichment factors. METHODS: In a multicenter prospective cohort study of 400 critically ill septic patients, we derived and validated thresholds for each marker and expressed prognostic enrichment using risk differences (RD) of 30-day mortality as predictive values. We then used decision curve analysis to simulate the prognostic enrichment of each marker and compare different prognostic enrichment strategies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An admission sTNFR1 concentration > 8861 pg/ml identified patients with increased mortality in both the derivation (RD 21.6%) and validation (RD 17.8%) populations. Among immunocompetent patients, an IL8 concentration > 94 pg/ml identified patients with increased mortality in both the derivation (RD 17.7%) and validation (RD 27.0%) populations. An Ang2 level > 9761 pg/ml identified patients at 21.3% and 12.3% increased risk of mortality in the derivation and validation populations, respectively. Using sTNFR1 or IL8 to select high-risk patients improved clinical trial power and efficiency compared to selecting patients with septic shock. Ang2 did not outperform septic shock as an enrichment factor. CONCLUSIONS: Thresholds for sTNFR1 and IL8 consistently identified sepsis patients with higher mortality risk and may have utility for prognostic enrichment in sepsis trials."
15689065,The use of flow cytometry as a diagnostic test for malaria parasites.,2004,"A total of 453 clinical blood samples were determined for malaria parasites by flow cytometric assay (FCM) and reagents from Sysmex Corporation, Japan. In this study, the FCM greatly simplified and accelerated parasite detection, with sensitivity of 91.26%, specificity 86.28% and accuracy 87.42%. Overall, the parasite counts by flow cytometric measurement correlated well with the parasitemia measured by microscopic assay (regression coefficient = 0.9409). The detection limit was 0.05-0.1% parasitemia. No evidence of malaria parasites in either blood donor volunteers or other disease patients groups was determined by FCM. However, 48 samples who had been treated with antimalarial drugs and whose parasite microscopic counts were negative, showed false-positive results. When the data of these 48 samples were analyzed, they were found to have high levels of reticulocytes, ranging from 2.0-18.9%. This finding suggested that a high reticulocyte concentration in the blood may interfere with the performance of the FCM. Further improvement, by eliminating this interference, will make the FCM one of the most promising tests for malaria diagnosis."
25526798,Statin therapy and mortality from sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Statin therapy for sepsis has been suggested by observational studies. However, randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated this benefit. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to evaluate the effect of statin therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis. METHODS: We searched 6 electronic databases for articles published before August 2014. Randomized trials reporting the effect of statin therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis were included. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital or 28-day mortality. Two independent reviewers searched and identified studies and extracted data. Risk ratios (RRs) were pooled across studies using random-effects models and were verified using fixed-effects models. RESULTS: Seven randomized trials were included in the analyses, comprising 1720 patients. Statin therapy did not significantly decrease in-hospital mortality (RR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.24; I(2) = 0%; P = .68) or 28-day mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-1.89; I(2) = 57%; P = .85) in patients with sepsis. Study quality of the included trials was high; the median Jadad score was 4.5 (range, 4-5). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that statin therapy does not improve mortality outcomes in patients with sepsis compared with placebo."
16722877,Necrotising fasciitis: a new management algorithm based on clinical classification.,2004,"Necrotising fasciitis is a rare infection of the subcutaneous tissues. If untreated, it is invariably fatal, and thus a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis is required. The disease's manifestation can range from a fulminant presentation to a subtle and insidious development. The priority in every case is to proceed to radical surgical debridement. On review of the literature and based on our clinical experience, we propose a new classification based on clinical presentation and suggest an algorithm to facilitate the management of this devastating condition. Increasing awareness should be given to the management of the large wounds resulting from the surgical debridement of necrotising fasciitis."
20008906,A survey of attitudes towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias amongst United Kingdom microbiologists.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the UK are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Vancomycin is the usual first-line therapy. However, vancomycin treatment of BSIs due to MRSA strains with vancomycin MICs of 1-2 mg/L is successful in <10% of cases. No consensus exists on when to use newer agents, particularly when vancomycin MICs are >1 mg/L. We therefore surveyed UK practices of the management of MRSA BSIs due to isolates with increased vancomycin MICs. METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-one UK consultant microbiologists were contacted via e-mail and asked to take part in an online survey, hosted at www.surveymonkey.com. Responses were collated by the website, downloaded and analysed in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation) spreadsheet. RESULTS: One hundred and eight respondents participated in the survey. Only 32.7% routinely measure MICs, mostly by Etest. Forty-two percent use vancomycin alone for removable-focus infections, whilst for infections of cardiac or orthopaedic origin, 49% would add rifampicin. Few respondents use daptomycin, linezolid or tigecycline empirically. Sixty-nine percent would use linezolid as a second-line agent, with only 19% opting for daptomycin. For an isolate with a vancomycin MIC of 4 mg/L, respondents would use daptomycin (81%) or linezolid (91%) in patients with a poor clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin is the mainstay therapy for MRSA BSIs, even when MICs are not measured or raised, despite evidence of high failure rates. The use of newer agents frequently does not follow European or US licensed indications, may be inappropriate and may result in avoidable deaths."
31812296,Factors associated with treatment failure after advice from infectious disease specialists.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Risk factors associated with treatment failure after the infectious disease specialist's (IDS) advice remain unknown. We aimed to identify these risk factors. METHODS: We included patients hospitalized in our tertiary care center who consulted an infectious disease specialist between January 2013 and April 2015. Treatment failure was defined by a composite criterion: signs of sepsis beyond Day 3, ICU admission, or death. Treatment success was defined by the patient's sustained clinical improvement. RESULTS: A total of 240 IDS recommendations were made. Diagnosis was changed for 64 patients (26.7%) and 50 patients experienced treatment failure after the IDS advice. In multivariate analysis, compliance with the IDS advice was associated with a higher rate of success (OR=0.09, 95%CI [0.01-0.67]). Variables associated with treatment failure in the multivariate analysis were Charlson comorbidity score at admission (OR=1.24, 95%CI [1.03-1.50]), a history of infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria (OR=8.27, 95%CI [1.37-49.80]), and deterioration of the patient's status three days after the IDS advice (OR=12.50, 95%CI [3.16-49.46]). CONCLUSION: Reassessing IDS recommendations could be interesting for specific patients to further adapt and improve them."
41624828,High CRP and white blood cell counts are not reliable indicators of early-onset neonatal infection in full-term infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) is challenging, making it difficult to determine infection indicator characteristics and cutoff values in full-term infants. This study retrospectively analyzed full-term infants with high-risk factors for neonatal EOS but tested negative for EOS, aiming to identify infection indicator characteristics and their association with perinatal factors without antibiotic intervention. METHODS: Full-term infants at high risk for EOS who were admitted to rooming-in from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024 were included in the study. Blood routine examinations and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were dynamically monitored after birth. All demographic data and medical records were collected from the electronic medical records system. RESULTS: Among 103 neonates, only 2 had normal infection indicators. Within 24-48 h after birth, an additional 28 displayed normal infection indicators. Although most of the infants exhibited normal WBC within 24-48 h, 33 patients still had higher neutrophil percentages, and 62 had higher CRP levels. Moreover, several high-risk perinatal factors for abnormal infection indicators have been identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that infection indicators frequently showed abnormalities in full-term infants at high risk for EOS who tested negative. Few infants had normal infection indicators within 24 h, and although WBC levels normalized by 24-48 h, CRP levels remained elevated. Specific perinatal factors were also associated with abnormal infection markers. These findings reinforce the need for cautious interpretation of isolated biomarker elevations and support antimicrobial stewardship by highlighting the high frequency of abnormal indicators in uninfected infants, thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure."
26022592,A preterm infant with intractable metabolic acidosis: a devastating presentation of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum meningitis.,2014,"Sepsis-related mortality and morbidity are the leading issues that neonatal intensive care units struggle with worldwide. We report a preterm infant with septic shock and intractable metabolic acidosis whose postmortem microbiologic examination revealed Chryseobacterium meningosepticum meningitis. We would like to alert clinicians about this uncommon sepsis agent, and to call into question the treatment modalities for metabolic acidosis."
15816271,An unusual presentation of group B streptococcal sepsis.,2004,This paper describes the devastating outcome of a neonate who presented with severe late onset group B beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GBS) disease. There were extensive infarcts of the brain and gangrene of the toes. The purpose of this report is to alert healthcare workers of the unusual presentation and that fatal late onset group B beta-haemolytic streptococcal disease may occur despite early and effective management.
31839084,Relationship between Cellular Immunity Changes and Prognosis in Elderly Patients with Sepsis.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To detect relationship between cellular immunity changes and prognosis in elderly patients with sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: General Department and Emergency Care Unit, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Beijing, China, from January to December 2016. METHODOLOGY: Patients who had infection were included in this study, and divided into two groups; those with sepsis and no sepsis. One hundred and forty-one healthy volunteers were chosen to enroll in this study just as a control (control group). Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age; had hematological or immunological disease; had uncontrolled diabetes; and pretreated with immunosuppressive agents. Patients were further grouped according to age, their T lymphocyte subsets were compared, and their acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were compared. The 28-day re-hospitalisation rate was followed-up, and the effects of T lymphocyte subsets and APACHE II scores on this rate were statistical analysed. RESULTS: Out of the 687 patients, 350 patients had sepsis (sepsis group), and 337 patients had no sepsis (non-sepsis group). The age of these patients ranged from 19-96 years. CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T and natural NK cells were significantly lower in the elderly population, (p< 0.01). CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T and NK cells were significantly lower in the sepsis group, compared with patients in the non-sepsis group and control group; and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05), while APACHE II score was significantly higher (p<0.01). In the sepsis group, compared with the non-elderly population, CD3+T, CD4+T and NK cells were significantly lower in the elderly population; and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05), while APACHE II score was significantly higher (p<0.05). The 28-day re-hospitalisation rate was associated with CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T cells and APACHE II scores (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T cells and APACHE II scores can be used as independent predictors of the 28-day re-hospitalisation rate."
20135572,Fulminant sepsis-associated encephalopathy in two children: serial neuroimaging findings and clinical course.,2009,"We report on two children with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. They presented with fulminant neurological damage on clinical, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological findings. At onset, both went into deep coma after status epilepticus, resulting in near brain death. Both patients showed diffuse brain edema on CT and severe brain dysfunction on electroencephalography within a day of onset. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of one patient on day 2 showed restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia and the subcortical white matter of the frontal and occipital lobes. Brain edema aggravated and lasted for a few months despite a variety of treatments. MR imaging in the chronic phase revealed cracking lesions extending to the cerebral white matter, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. MR angiography showed diminished intracranial major arteries. These serial neuroradiological findings suggested severe brain damage resulting from fulminant elevation of intracranial pressure, which mimicked ""brain death"" or ""respirator brain""."
25734098,Bacteremia with Aerococcus sanguinicola: Case Series with Characterization of Virulence Properties.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Since Aerococcus sanguinicola was designated as a species in 2001, only a few cases of bacteremia have been reported. The aim with this study was to describe the clinical presentation of A sanguinicola bacteremia and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility and the capacity of the bacteria to form biofilm and to induce platelet aggregation. METHODS: Isolates of A sanguinicola from blood cultures were retrospectively identified from 2 clinical microbiology laboratories for 2006 to 2012. Species identity was confirmed through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The medical charts of patients were reviewed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for relevant antibiotics was determined. Biofilm formation was measured as the amount of crystal violet absorbed. Platelet aggregation was determined by aggregometry. RESULTS: Eleven cases of A sanguinicola bacteremia were identified. All patients were male and the median age was 82 years (range 67-93). Nine patients fulfilled criteria for severe sepsis, and 2 patients died at hospital. Two patients were diagnosed with infective endocarditis. Most patients had underlying urinary tract diseases or an indwelling urinary tract catheter. Five patients suffered from dementia. None of the patients was treated with immunosuppressive medications. The MIC values of the isolates were in line with previous reports, with low MICs for penicillin, cefotaxime, and vancomycin. All 11 isolates produced biofilms but not all could induce platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: A sanguinicola can cause severe infections in elderly men with urinary tract abnormalities and the bacteria possess potential virulence mechanisms."
31859099,Impact of insufficient admission vitamin D serum concentrations on sepsis incidence and clinical outcomes in patients with thermal injury.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In burn patients, vitamin D has been studied primarily in the pediatric population and focused mainly on the correlation with bone marker measurements and incidence of fractures. There is an association between vitamin D deficiency and the development of sepsis in non-burn critically-ill patients. However, there is limited data on vitamin D concentrations and clinical outcomes in burn patients, such as sepsis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vitamin D concentrations on the incidence of sepsis in adult burn patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of patients 18 years of age and older admitted between February 1, 2016 and February 28, 2018 to an American Burn Association (ABA) verified burn center with diagnosis of burn injury. The primary endpoint was incidence of sepsis using the ABA 2007 Sepsis Consensus Criteria between patients with adequate vitamin D concentrations (25[OH]D > 20 ng/mL) and insufficient vitamin D (25[OH]D < 20 ng/mL) concentrations measured on admission. Descriptive statistics were used for baseline demographics. Univariate analysis was conducted using Chi-square, Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were screened and 107 patients were included in this study. Sixty three patients (58.9%) had insufficient vitamin D concentrations. Patient demographics were overall similar between groups. The median total body surface area burned was 14.6% in the insufficient vitamin D group, and 12.1% in the adequate vitamin D group (p = 0.2). There was a trend towards greater incidence of sepsis in the insufficient vitamin D group in the univariate analysis (15.9% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.07). The multivariable logistic regression analysis found that adequate vitamin D concentrations was associated with a reduction in the incidence of sepsis (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.88). The insufficient vitamin D group had a longer median hospital LOS (19 [IQR 11-37] vs 11.5 [IQR 7-20] days, p < 0.05), longer intensive care unit LOS (17 [IQR 10-37] vs 5 [IQR 2-19.5] days, p < 0.05) and fewer ventilator free days (26 [IQR 18-28] vs 28 [IQR 27-28] days, p < 0.05). There was no difference in mortality between groups (p = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with adequate vitamin D concentrations on admission had a reduction in the incidence of sepsis as compared to patients with insufficient vitamin D concentrations. Insufficient vitamin D concentrations may contribute to other worsened clinical outcomes in burn patients. Our findings set the stage for future, multicenter studies to determine the role of vitamin D supplementation in burn patients."
41426760,Perforated Jejunal Diverticulitis: A Retrospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Jejunal diverticulitis is a rare but clinically significant cause of abdominal pain that often mimics other intra-abdominal conditions and carries a risk of serious complications, including perforation. Management strategies have varied between conservative treatment with antibiotics and surgical resection, but evidence has remained limited, particularly in small case series. METHODS: A single-centre, retrospective observational study was conducted at the Royal Stoke University Hospital (UK). Patients diagnosed with jejunal diverticular perforation (JDP) between January 2012 and March 2025 were identified from the electronic patient record system. Data on demographics, presentation, imaging, treatment, complications, and outcomes were collected. Statistical analysis included descriptive summaries and exploratory comparisons between surgical and conservative management groups using Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included (mean age 71.5 +/- 14.8 years; 75% male). All had undergone contrast-enhanced CT, which demonstrated jejunal diverticulitis with features of perforation in every case. Seven patients (58.3%) were managed surgically, most commonly with segmental jejunal resection and primary anastomosis, while five patients (41.7%) were treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care. Complications occurred in 42.9% of surgical cases and 40.0% of conservative cases, and no mortality was observed in either group. CONCLUSION: Jejunal diverticulitis with perforation was an uncommon but important diagnosis that required early recognition and CT imaging for confirmation. Both conservative and surgical management strategies achieved favourable outcomes, and treatment should be guided by clinical stability, response to antibiotics, and suitability for surgery."
41651600,"Pediatric Sepsis: Evolving Subphenotypes, Overlap Syndromes, and the Path to Precision Therapies.",2026,"Pediatric sepsis is a complex syndrome shaped by developmental considerations, age-specific physiology, immunologic heterogeneity, and hyperinflammatory overlap syndromes. Recent evidence underscores a dynamic interplay between hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis in pediatric patients with sepsis, emphasizing the need for rapid, personalized diagnostic tools. While revised pediatric scoring systems and targeted immunotherapies have been developed, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal timing and patient selection for immunomodulatory interventions. This article consolidates current understanding of pediatric sepsis pathobiology, explores emerging pediatric subphenotypes, and examines early stage clinical trials investigating precision medicine approaches in pediatric sepsis."
25327666,"Development and validation of a prediction model for diagnosing blood stream infections in febrile, non-neutropenic children with cancer.",2015,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric oncology patients are at increased risk for blood stream infections (BSI). Risk in the absence of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >/=500/microl) is not well defined. PROCEDURE: In a retrospective cohort of febrile (temperature >/=38.0 degrees  for >1 hr or >/=38.3 degrees ) pediatric oncology patients with ANC >/=500/microl, a diagnostic prediction model for BSI was constructed using logistic regression modeling and the following candidate predictors: age, ANC, absolute monocyte count, body temperature, inpatient/outpatient presentation, sex, central venous catheter type, hypotension, chills, cancer diagnosis, stem cell transplant, upper respiratory symptoms, and exposure to cytarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, or anti-GD2 antibody. The model was internally validated with bootstrapping methods. RESULTS: Among 932 febrile episodes in 463 patients, we identified 91 cases of BSI. Independently significant predictors for BSI were higher body temperature (Odds ratio [OR] 2.36 P < 0.001), tunneled external catheter (OR 13.79 P < 0.001), peripherally inserted central catheter (OR 3.95 P = 0.005), elevated ANC (OR 1.19 P = 0.024), chills (OR 2.09 P = 0.031), and hypotension (OR 3.08 P = 0.004). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis (OR 0.34 P = 0.026), increased age (OR 0.70 P = 0.049), and drug exposure (OR 0.08 P < 0.001) were associated with decreased risk for BSI. The risk prediction model had a C-index of 0.898; after bootstrapping adjustment for optimism, corrected C-index 0.885. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a diagnostic prediction model for BSI in febrile pediatric oncology patients without severe neutropenia. External validation is warranted before use in clinical practice.

41476761,Plasma Bile Acid Profiling Reveals Novel Early Diagnostic Biomarkers for Pediatric Sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early detection remains a challenge. While bile acids have been implicated in various diseases, their role as biomarkers for sepsis is underexplored. This study aims to identify metabolites associated with sepsis and assess the potential of bile acids for early diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric sepsis. METHODS: We enrolled 100 participants in the discovery phase and 141 participants in the validation phase. Non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites between sepsis patients and healthy controls. Targeted quantitative analysis of 12 plasma bile acids (BA) was conducted to assess their concentrations. Machine learning algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine-RFE (SVM-RFE), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), were employed to identify key BAs for sepsis diagnosis. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics revealed bile acid pathway dysregulation, validated by targeted quantification showing elevated primary bile acids-cholic acid (CA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA)-and taurine-conjugated secondary bile acid TDCA (p<0.05). Conversely, secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA) were significantly reduced (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression identified TCA, TDCA, GCA, TCDCA, GCDCA, and TDCA/DCA as risk factors for sepsis, while LCA, DCA, UDCA, GUDCA, and DCA/CA were protective factors. Five machine learning models identified four bile acid indicators-UDCA, GUDCA, GCA, DCA-as key predictors for sepsis diagnosis, with a combined model area under the curve (AUC) of 0.880. Additionally, DCA/CA and GCDCA were important predictors for septic shock, with risks increasing by 4.5% (OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.009-1.081) and 30% (OR = 0.700, 95% CI: 0.526-0.932), respectively. LCA was a risk factor for respiratory failure in sepsis, with an OR of 2.154 (95% CI: 1.022-4.540). CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential of bile acid profiling as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pediatric sepsis. These findings suggest a path toward early intervention, improving patient outcomes by enabling timely detection and treatment."
19936657,On admission hypomagnesemia in critically ill children: Risk factors and outcome.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and associated risk factors of hypomagnesemia in pediatric intensive care unit on admission in a developing country. METHODS: It is a retrospective chart review of 179 children aged 1 mo - 15yr admitted in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of our university during 18 months and recorded serum Mg level on admission. Patients were divided into two groups according to their Mg level (Normo-magnesemic and Hypomagnesemic) and their p-value, crude and adjusted odds ratios (AoR) were calculated. RESULTS: Upon admission in PICU 79(44%) patients were found hypomagnesemia. There was no difference in age and gender between two groups. The important risk factors identified were age greater than one yr (p 0.05, AOR 3.71), sepsis (p 0.03, AOR 3.11), hypokalemia (p 0.06, AOR 1.8), hypocalcemia (p 0.05, AOR 1.6), diuretic use (p 0.05, AOR 1.37), Aminoglycoside use (p 0.003, AOR 3.12), and hospitalization greater than five days (p 0.03, AOR 1.71). Those with normo-magnesemic had higher mortality rate (32/100 or 32%) than those with hypomagnesemia (22/79 or 27.8%). CONCLUSION: The present finding indicates that hypomagnesemia is a common among PICU patients and is influenced by several factors."
15584411,Experimental infections of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar with Spironucleus barkhanus.,2004,"Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. (Salmonidae) were experimentally infected with Spironucleus barkhanus (Diplomonadida: Hexamitidae). Parasites were found in the blood 1 to 8 wk after infection, after which they disappeared from the blood and were found mainly in the internal organs (e.g. spleen and liver), eye socket or muscles. Mortality (38 out of 40 infected fish) occurred when fish had lesions in internal organs and/or on the body surface. Uninfected fish cohabiting with infected fish became infected after 4 wk, indicating direct transmission. There was no difference in susceptibility to spironucleosis between 3 different families of Atlantic salmon. All families developed the disease with a similar pattern of parasitaemia in the blood, similar clinical signs and gross pathology, and with very high mortality (29 out of 30). Clinical signs of systemic spironucleosis may include anemia, skin blisters, muscle ulcerations or unilateral exophthalmia. Gross pathologies include hemorrhaging of internal organs, splenomegaly or deformed (globulated) spleen, or granulomatous lesions in the spleen and liver."
25560254,Clonal dissemination of invasive and colonizing clonal complex 1 of serotype VI group B Streptococcus in central Taiwan.,2016,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate clinical presentation, serotype distribution and genetic correlation of group B streptococcus (GBS) diseases. Since serotype VI prevalence far exceeded that reported in prior studies, genetic relationship of isolates was further analyzed. METHODS: GBS isolates obtaining from patients with invasive diseases and pregnant women with colonization between June 2007 and December 2010 were analyzed. All isolates were tested for serotypes by multiplex PCR assay and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Serotype VI isolates were further analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 134 GBS isolates were recovered from blood of 126 patients with invasive disease (94.0%) and anogenital swabs of 8 pregnant women (6.0%). Most common serotype was Ib (21.6%), followed by V (20.1%), VI (18.7%), III (15.7%), II (11.9 %), Ia (11.2%), and IX (0.7%). Serotype VI was also the leading type in infants with early onset disease (EOD; 3/8, 37.5%) and colonizing pregnant women (3/8, 37.5%). PFGE distinguished 33 pulsotypes, reflecting genetic diversity among GBS isolates. Among 25 serotype VI isolates tested, 14 were ST-1, seven were ST-679, three were ST-678, one was ST-681, and distributed into four PFGE pulsotypes. ST-678, ST-679, and ST-681 were novel sequence types; ST-678 and ST-679 are single-locus variants of ST-1 that belongs to clonal complex (CC) 1. CONCLUSION: CC1 dissemination of serotype VI GBS thus emerges as an important invasive pathogen in infants and nonpregnant adults in central Taiwan. Serotype prevalence of GBS must be continuously monitored geographically to guide prevention strategy of GBS vaccines."
31808452,"Adrenal insufficiency in decompensated cirrhotic patients without infection: prevalence, predictors and impact on mortality.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) is common in compensated and decompensated chronic liver disease in the presence of sepsis. This study was performed to find out the prevalence of RAI in decompensated cirrhotic patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding without any evidence of infection. METHODS: The study prospectively included 75 cirrhotic patients with signs of decompensation. The short Synacthen test (SST) was performed on all patients after ruling out infection. Patients with positive blood, urine, sputum, ascitic and pleural fluid cultures or evidence of infection on chest X-ray and those with elevated procalcitonin levels (>0.05 ng/ml) were excluded. RAI in critical illness was defined by a delta cortisol level (difference between basal and post-stimulation cortisol) of </=9 mug/dl after SST. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 54 +/- 11 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleed and hepatic encephalopathy were seen in 56.6% and 41.5%, respectively, and both were seen in 1.9%. Of the 75 patients, 55 (73%) were in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class C and the mean model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 21 +/- 7. Forty-five patients (60%) met our criteria for RAI. Those with RAI had lower serum albumin (2.4 +/- 0.5 g/dl vs 2.7 +/- 0.5 g/dl, p = 0.03) and higher MELD scores (22 +/- 7 vs 19 +/- 6, p = 0.03). Prevalence of RAI in CTP class C was 65% (36 out of 55 patients) compared to 45% (9 out of 20 patients) in Child-Pugh stage A and B. Similarly, 82% (23 out of 28 patients) with MELD scores >25 had RAI compared to 54% with MELD scores <20. None of biochemical parameters were predictive of RAI on logistic regression analysis. Three-month mortality rate was not significantly different in patients with or without adrenal insufficiency (44% vs 28%, p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: The present study showed RAI to be common in noninfected decompensated cirrhotic patients, but did not predict 3-month mortality. There were no other predictive factors in those with RAI. Hence, in patients with cirrhosis without infection, the clinical utility of routine adrenal function testing needs further elucidation."
31888350,Comparison of Vancomycin Area-Under-the-Curve Dosing Versus Trough Target-Based Dosing in Obese and Nonobese Patients With Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia.,2020,"Background: A vancomycin target of area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) ratio >/=400 is recommended for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Objective: To evaluate vancomycin total daily dose (TDD) achieving trough targets versus a calculated strategy achieving AUC targets based on body mass index (BMI). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed within a large hospital network. Patients with MRSA bacteremia were eligible if they received vancomycin with a steady-state trough (15-20 mg/L). Cockcroft-Gault was used to estimate creatinine clearance, calculating vancomycin clearance and AUC. Patients were stratified by BMI (less than/greater than 30 kg/m(2)). The primary outcome was vancomycin TDD for the trough-based strategy compared with an AUC-dosing strategy. Results: A total of 119 patients were included, including 51 (42.9%) and 68 (57.1%) patients with high- and low-BMI, respectively. The TDD for trough-based dosing (2390.76 +/- 1224.59 mg) differed significantly from AUC-based dosing (1985.07 +/- 616.18 mg) across the cohort (P = 0.0014). For patients with high BMI, there was a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in TDD between trough (2637.25 +/- 1327.89 mg) versus AUC (1918.71 +/- 625.89 mg) strategies. No difference in TDD between dosing strategies was observed among low-BMI patients. Across all patients, 46 (38.7%) experienced acute kidney injury (AKI); high-BMI patients experienced higher rates of AKI compared with low-BMI patients (54.9 vs 26.5%; P = 0.002). Conclusions and Relevance: An AUC-based dosing strategy may reduce vancomycin TDD required for MRSA bacteremia compared with trough-based dosing, particularly for patients with higher BMI."
20092768,[Enteral versus parenteral nutrition after gastrointestinal surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the different prognosis between enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) in patients after gastrointestinal surgery (GIS), and to investigate a reasonable regimen of enteral nutrition (EN) after GIS. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on EN/PN after GIS from 1970 to 2008 retrieved from the data bank of Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were analyzed. Evaluation endpoints were anastomotic dehiscence, infection (catheter sepsis, wound infection, pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess and urinary tract infection), vomiting and abdominal distention, other complications, length of hospital stay and mortality rate. RESULTS: Twenty-three RCTs including 2784 patients met the entering criteria. Compared with PN, EN was beneficial in the reduction of anastomotic dehiscence (RR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.50 - 0.91; P = 0.010), infections (RR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64 - 0.81; P < 0.001), other complication (RR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73 - 0.92; P < 0.001) and duration of hospital stay (weighted mean difference: -3.60; 95%CI: -3.88 - -3.32; P < 0.001). But the risk of vomiting was increased among patients with EN (RR = 1.39, 95%CI: 1.21 - 1.59; P < 0.001), and there was no significant differences in mortalities between the two groups (P = 0.400). CONCLUSIONS: There is no advantage in treating patients 'nil by mouth' after gastrointestinal surgery. It indicated that early commencement of enteral feeding is beneficial."
41420530,Diagnostic and Prognostic Evaluation of Presepsin Levels in Neonatal Septicemia: A Hospital-Based Study.,2025,"AIMS: Neonatal septicemia is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, and its early diagnosis remains a major challenge. Rapid and reliable biomarkers are essential for timely management. Presepsin, a soluble CD14 subtype, has emerged as a promising early sepsis marker, though evidence in neonates is scarce. This study evaluated its diagnostic and prognostic performance in suspected neonatal sepsis, covering bacterial and fungal infections. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary hospital from May 2023 to November 2024. Eighty-eight neonates with clinically suspected sepsis were enrolled. Blood samples were collected for culture, C-reactive protein (CRP) measured by semiquantitative latex agglutination and Presepsin measured by ELISA. Diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic analysis, and associations with clinical features, birth weight, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Blood cultures were positive in 57 (64.8%) neonates, including 39 bacterial and 18 fungal cases. Presepsin levels were significantly higher in culture-proven sepsis (1208.5 +/- 319.4 pg/mL) than probable sepsis (828.9 +/- 235.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001). ROC analysis identified a cutoff of 906.6 pg/mL, yielding 90% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 84% diagnostic accuracy. Presepsin levels rose faster than CRP, enabling earlier detection. Higher levels were noted in fungal sepsis (1441.4 +/- 357.5 pg/mL) and in neonates with poor outcomes, correlating with longer hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin is a rapid, reliable biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of neonatal sepsis, including fungal infections. Its use alongside clinical assessment can support timely therapeutic decisions, reduce hospital stay, and improve survival in high-risk neonates."
15597781,[Understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of SIRS and sepsis and development of innovative therapies of sepsis].,2004,"The concept of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was introduced in 1992 to define and objectively diagnose sepsis. Over the last decade, the definition of sepsis has been used for inclusion criteria of multicenter trials to develop innovative therapies of sepsis. With the recent understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of sepsis, many drugs have been tested, but only two drugs (activated protein C and neutrophil-elastase inhibitor) have been approved for clinical use in sepsis or SIRS. Further understanding of basic pathophysiology of SIRS and sepsis holds promise to develop a new therapeutic strategy to improve survival of patients with SIRS and sepsis."
31891611,Hypofibrinolysis induced by tranexamic acid does not influence inflammation and mortality in a polymicrobial sepsis model.,2019,"The biological relevance of fibrinolysis to the host response to sepsis is illustrated by pathogens such as S. pyogenes and Y. pestis, whose virulence factors are proteins that challenge the balance between pro- and anti-fibrinolytic factors of the host, and by the consistent finding of hypofibrinolysis in the early stages of sepsis. Whether this hypofibrinolytic response is beneficial or detrimental to the host, by containing the spread of pathogens while at the same time limiting the access of immune cell to infectious foci, is still a matter of debate. Tranexamic acid (TnxAc) is an antifibrinolytic agent that is being increasingly used to prevent and control bleeding in conditions such as elective orthopedic surgery, trauma, and post-partum-hemorrhage, which are frequently followed by infection and sepsis. Here we used a model of polymicrobial sepsis to evaluate whether hypofibrinolysis induced by TnxAc influenced survival, tissue injury and pathogen spread. Mice were treated with two doses of TnxAc bid for 48h, and then sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Despite the induction of hypofibrinolysis by TnxAc, no difference could be observed in survival, tissue injury (measured by biochemical and histological parameters), cytokine levels or pathogen spread. Our results contribute with a new piece of data to the understanding of the complex interplay between fibrinolysis and innate immunity. While our results do not support the use of TnxAc in sepsis, they also address the thrombotic safety of TnxAc, a low cost and widely used agent to prevent bleeding."
19950541,"[Comparison of PCR, ELISA-CSP and direct microscopic observation methods for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in Anopheles gambiae M in Senegal].",2009,"A comparative study between the Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA-CSP) for circumsporozoitic antigen detection method, the direct observation after dissection and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique used to identify Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA markers was carried out. This to evaluate the sensibility and the specificity of the PCR, for the determination of both sporozoitic index (ICSP) and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). The study is conducted in laboratory on eighty six specimens of Anopheles gambiae M infected after being fed with the blood of a gametocytes carrier from Dielmo (Senegal). Salivary glands of forty-eight specimens randomly selected (test A) among the infected eighty six are microscopically observed after manual dissection for the sporozoites detection. The content of these salivary glands and the crushed head/thorax of the remaining 38 specimens (test B) are tested in ELISA-CSP and PCR. The positive and negative results obtained were recorded and summarized for each method. A pair-comparison of the results obtained with each method generally revealed a good sensibility and an excellent specificity The kappa coefficient (K) of test A indicated a ""moderate"" to ""excellent"" concordance between the three different methods performed. By using the crushed head/thorax sample, generally used to determine the transmission parameters (ICSP and EIR), the PCR/ELISA-CSP concordance was excellent. In the light of the values of sensibility and specificity obtained, this PCR is comparable to the other methods for the assessment of sporozoitic index and entomological inoculation rate."
25541009,[Group B streptococcal early-onset neonatal sepsis in the area of Barcelona (2004-2010). Analysis of missed opportunities for prevention].,2015,"OBJECTIVES: To study the evolution of the incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) by Streptococcus agalactiae in the area of Barcelona and to analyze failure of compliance with the prevention protocol. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out on EOS cases in 8 Health-Care Centers in the Barcelona area between 2004 and 2010. RESULTS: Forty-nine newborns from 48 mothers were diagnosed with EOS. The incidence was 0.29 per thousand living newborns (0.18-0.47 per thousand), with no significant differences in the fluctuations along the 7 years. The mortality rate was 8.16%. In 68.5% cases the maternal colonization studies were negative, and in 21% these studies were not performed. No risk factors were detected in 58.3% of pregnant women, and 22.9% of births were premature. In 58% of cases intra-partum antibiotic prophylaxis was not administered because it was not indicated, and in 42% due to failure to follow the protocol (3 strains were resistant to erythromycin). Resistance to clindamycin was 33.3%. The Streptococcus agalactiae serotypes more frequently isolated were iii, v, and ia. CONCLUSIONS: No significant changes were detected in the incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae EOS in the 7 years of the study. The increased sensitivity of screening methods with the use of molecular techniques, the performance of susceptibility testing of strains isolated from pregnant women, and the improvement of communication between Health-Care Centers, can contribute to a better implementation of the protocol, as well as to reduce the incidence of EOS."
31818900,Resection of a large mycotic aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary artery.,2019,"A 50-year-old Indigenous woman, on home haemodialysis, was found to have a large mycotic aneurysm of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery at the site of a previous drug-eluting stent. Blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive S taphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. She underwent a complex operation involving resection of the mycotic aneurysm, removal of the stent and a coronary artery bypass graft to the distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery using the left internal mammary artery. She had a complicated intensive care unit admission with pericardial tamponade on day 1 postoperatively requiring reopening and removal of clot and type 1 respiratory failure requiring reintubation on day 10 postoperatively. Once extubated, she developed prolonged hyperactive delirium and a significant decline in mobility. Over the course of a 6-week hospital admission, she received extensive multidisciplinary care and was discharged for rehabilitation to a peripheral hospital. She was discharged home after rehabilitation with ongoing follow-up with infectious diseases."
20425739,Acute renal failure in the intensive care unit: aetiological and predisposing factors and outcome.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Acute renal failure (ARF) in the intensive care unit (ICU) complicates 20 to 35% of admissions worldwide. There is no information on the pattern of ARF in our ICU and factors that influence survival. OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude of acute renal failure, and outcome among patients at an ICU in Nigeria. METHODS: Adult patients requiring intensive care, and with ARF were recruited. Severity of ARF was assessed using the Liano prognostic scoring system and a modified version of APACHE II prognostic scores. Haemodialysis was offered when indicated. Management outcomes were noted while a relationship was sought between severity of ARF and outcome. RESULTS: Forty (19.6%) of the 204 patients managed during the period had ARF. These included 28 (70%) males and 12 (30%) females. Twelve (30%) of the patients had head injury while eight (20%) had major burns. Surgical sepsis accounted for seven (17.5%), while six (15%) patients had advanced metastatic carcinoma. Multiple fractures accounted for four (10%) while other causes accounted for the remaining 16 (40%). The mean serum creatinine and urea were 863.3+95umol per litre and 19.45(4.1) mmol per litre respectively. The Liano scores ranged from 33% to 99% , mean of 61 + or - 4.2%) while modified APACHE II score ranged from 5-19 (mean of 11 + or - 3.2). There was a significant correlation between the Liano scores and outcome (p<0.007) while the modified APACHE II score did not influence the outcome (P>0.05). Eighty percent of patients who had two or more organ failure died compared to 20% of the patients with less than two organ failure. Eight (20%) patients survived. Dialysis therapy significantly influenced outcome as 100% of the dialysed patients survived compared to 80% of those who were not. CONCLUSION: Acute renal failure presents a continuing challenge in the ICU setting with attendant of high morbidity and mortality. Dialysis significantly influences survival, hence, the service should be provided in every intensive care unit."

Salmonella myocarditis is an unusual complication of salmonella sepsis in adults. Cases that do occur may be associated with high morbidity and mortality. We present a rare case of salmonella myocarditis with multi-organ failure in a previously healthy young adult man who was brought to the emergency room with fever, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and altered sensorium, discovered to have acute pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise for which he was assisted with mechanical ventilation for 8 days. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi. Biochemically he exhibited myocardial, hepatic, and muscular enzymatic surge with renal failure, features of rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient showed a progressive improvement on treatment with ceftriaxone for 2 weeks in addition to decongestive therapy. He was discharged in good condition afterward."
31870587,Clinical efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of bloodstream infection caused by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.,2020,"Empirical combination therapy with beta-lactams and glycopeptides is recommended for patients with presumed staphylococcal bloodstream infection (BSI). While coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) remain susceptible to vancomycin, such isolates have become less susceptible to teicoplanin. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of BSI caused by methicillin-resistant CNS according to teicoplanin susceptibility. Inclusion criteria were patients with intravascular-catheter related BSIs caused by methicillin-resistant CNS (positive for two or more specimens); teicoplanin therapy; and at least one of the signs or symptoms caused by BSI. Antimicrobial resistance was defined as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >/=8 mug/mL. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical success evaluated 2 weeks after the completion of teicoplanin therapy [test of cure (TOC)]. Resistant rate of CNS was 0% for vancomycin and 22.9% for teicoplanin, and geometric mean MICs were 1.31 mug/mL and 3.41 mug/mL, respectively (p < 0.001). The catheter was removed in all patients except one, and high early clinical response at 72 h after starting therapy was obtained irrespective of teicoplanin susceptibility. The clinical success rate at TOC was 60% in patients with BSIs caused by teicoplanin-resistant strains, while 90% in patients with BSIs caused by susceptible strains (p = 0.052). In multivariate analyses, teicoplanin resistance was significant factor for decreased clinical success at TOC (adjusted odds ratio 0.138, 95% confidence interval 0.020-0.961, p = 0.045). Because of the poor clinical efficacy of teicoplanin against teicoplanin-resistant CNS, combination therapy comprising vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics should be considered in presumed staphylococci BSI."
41419476,Distinct gastrointestinal microbial signatures predict parasite levels in controlled Plasmodium infections in both rhesus macaques and humans.,2025,"Functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome include maintenance of immune homeostasis and protection against infectious disease. Current assessments of the role of the GI microbiome in Plasmodium infection have been primarily conducted using mouse models and observational human cohorts. Here, we experimentally assessed associations between pre-infection GI microbiome composition and acute Plasmodium parasitemia using 16S rRNA sequencing and samples from rhesus macaques (RMs) and adult humans enrolled in a previously conducted controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trial (NCT04072302) originally designed to test the efficacy of KAF156, a novel imidazolopiperazine class of antimalarial drugs. We identified distinct pre-infection 16S microbial signatures that were associated with increased risk for above median parasitemia in RMs infected with P. fragile and CHMI participants infected with P. falciparum. Further, we identified a Bifidobacterium feature set that accurately stratified parasitemia risk and could therefore serve as a foundation for a potential biomarker panel to aid prevention efforts in malaria endemic regions. Together, our findings demonstrate that pre-infection GI microbiome composition is indicative of risk for Plasmodium parasitemia, and our observation that the pre-infection microbiome-P. fragile dynamic in RMs mirrors the pre-infection microbiome-P. falciparum interaction in CHMI participants supports the future use of this model in pre-clinical investigations of novel microbiome-targeting approaches to reduce malaria burden."
15581466,[Myocardial dysfunction and septic shock].,2004,"Myocardial dysfunction frequently accompanies severe sepsis and septic shock. It is now clear that such a myocardial depression, as evidenced by biventricular alteration, is present during the early phase of sepsis in most patients. Myocardial depression exists despite a fluid loading-dependent hyperdynamic state and usually recovers within 7 to 10 days in survivors. Myocardial dysfunction does not appear to be due to irreversible structural abnormalities nor to myocardial hypoperfusion, but rather linked to many circulating mediators including cytokines. At a cellular level, reduced myocardial contractility could be related in part to apoptosis and induced by both nitric oxide-dependent and nitric oxide-independent mechanisms. However, whatever the mechanism involved, it leads to calcium homeostasis abnormality. The present review describes both the diagnosis procedure and the molecular and cellular pathways of sepsis-induced myocardial depression."
25837225,Parenteral glutamine supplementation in combination with enteral nutrition improves intestinal immunity in septic rats.,2015,"OBJECTIVES: The gut-associated lymphoid tissue is continuously exposed to antigens in the gut lumen and becomes the first line of defense against enteric bacteria and associated toxin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of parenteral glutamine (GLN) supplementation in combination with enteral nutrition (EN) on intestinal mucosal immunity in septic rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: A sham CLP + EN + saline group (n = 10), a sham CLP + EN + GLN group (n = 10), a CLP + EN + saline group (n = 10), and a CLP + EN + GLN group (n = 10). At 2 h after CLP or sham CLP, all rats in each of the four groups received an identical enteral nutrition solution as their base formula. Then, the rats in the sham CLP + EN + GLN group and CLP + EN + GLN group were given 0.35 g GLN/kg body weight daily for 7 d, all at the same time, via a tail vein injection; whereas those in the sham CLP + EN + saline group and CLP + EN + saline group were daily administered isovolumic sterile 0.9% saline for comparison. All rats in each of the four groups were given 290 kcal/kg body wt/d for 7 d. At the end of the seventh day after the nutritional program was finished, all rats were euthanized and the entire intestine was collected. Total Peyer's patches (PP) cell yield was counted by a hemocytometer. The percentage of PP lymphocyte subsets was analyzed by flow cytometry. The number of intestinal lamina propria IgA plasma cells was determined by the immunohistochemistry technique. The intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were assessed by ELISA. PP apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxyuridine nick-end labeling. RESULTS: The results revealed total PP cell yield, the numbers of PP lymphocyte subsets, intestinal lamina propria IgA plasma cells, and intestinal IgA levels in the CLP + EN + GLN group were significantly increased when compared with the CLP + EN + saline group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the number of TUNEL-stained cells within PPs in the CLP + EN + GLN group was markedly decreased as compared with the CLP + EN + saline group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that parenteral glutamine supplementation in combination with enteral nutrition may attenuate PP apoptosis, increase PP cell yield and intestinal lamina propria IgA plasma cells, and subsequently improve intestinal mucosal immunity. Clinically, these results suggest therapeutic efforts at improving intestinal immunity may contribute to the prevention and treatment of sepsis."
20118059,Nosocomial sepsis-induced late onset thrombocytopenia in a neonatal tertiary care unit: a prospective study.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Late onset sepsis (LOS)( onset of sepsis >72 hours of age or nosocomial sepsis) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Thrombocytopenia is an important complication of sepsis. We investigated the incidence of thrombocytopenia in LOS patients and studied the influence of various parameters on platelet response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Infants born in the level 3 neonatal intensive care unit between January 2002 and December 2006 with documented LOS were included in this prospective study. Multiple hemograms with platelet counts, bacterial blood culture and fungal blood culture were obtained in all patients. Demographic and clinical data were compared between patients without thrombocytopenia and with mild, moderate and severe thrombocytopenia. Duration of thrombocytopenia in relation to type of organism and mortality with respect to degree of thrombocytopenia were also studied. RESULTS: Of 200 patients with culture-proven nosocomial sepsis, 119 (59.5%) patients developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 X 109/L). In our series Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated organism (125/200, 62.5%) and the incidence of thrombocytopenia was 60.0% (75/125). However, the incidence of thrombo- cytopenia was highest among patients who had concurrent bacterial and fungal sepsis (28/31, 90.3%). Coagulase- negative staphylococcal (CoNS) sepsis was present in 21 (10.5%) patients and the incidence of thrombocytopenia was 33.3%. Isolated fungal sepsis was present only in 6 (3%) patients and the incidence of thrombocytopenia was 66.0%. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was highest among preterm babies and low-birth weight (LBW) babies. Twenty-seven percent (54/200) of babies presented with mild thrombocytopenia, 20% (40/200) presented with moderate thrombocytopenia, and 12.5%(25/200) developed severe thrombocytopenia. Severity of thrombocytopenia was also directly related to the presence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The mortality rate was significantly associated with the degree of thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: LOS sepsis is an important risk factor for thrombocytopenia in the NICU. Fungal and gram- negative sepsis are frequently associated with a decreased platelet count. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia is more common among LBW babies and preterm babies. The mortality rate is significantly related to degree of thrombocytopenia."
25679934,[Septic vasculitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes].,2014,"Septic vasculitis is a medium and small-vessel vasculitis caused by direct action of pathogens, associated with bacteremia. It is an uncommon condition; clinical manifestations include purpura, ulcers and vesicles-pustules. Most cases of septic vasculitis are related to meningococcemia. There are no cases reported in medical literature associated to Listeria spp. We report a case of a 71 year-old man who presented sepsis by Listeria monocytogenes, and then evolved with purpuric skin lesions. Skin biopsy revealed a septic vasculitis."
15619511,Epizootiology of blood parasites in an Australian lizard: a mark-recapture study of a natural population.,2005,"The dynamics of a naturally endemic blood parasite (Hepatozoon hinuliae) were studied in a lizard (Eulamprus quoyii) host population, using 2 years of longitudinal data. We investigated how parasite abundance in the population varied over time, examined whether certain host sub-populations were more prone to infection, and compared parasite loads in relation to host reproductive behaviour. We recorded blood parasite infections of 331 individuals, obtained in 593 captures. Prevalence (the proportion of the host population infected) of blood parasites was high; approximately 66% of the lizard population was infected. Probability of infection increased with host age and size, but did not differ between the sexes. Within individuals, parasite load (the intensity of infection within individuals) did not vary over time, and was independent of host reproductive behaviour. Parasite load was significantly higher in males compared to females."
31890224,Non-convulsive seizures in the encephalopathic critically ill cancer patient does not necessarily portend a poor prognosis.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is present in 10-30% of ICU patients with altered mental status (AMS) and is associated to poor outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no data describing the prevalence and outcomes of critically ill cancer patients with AMS associated to non-convulsive seizures (NCS) or NCSE. We aim to describe the outcomes and risk factors of critically ill cancer patients with encephalopathy associated with non-convulsive seizures (NCS). METHODS: This is a 3-year prospective observational study in a mixed oncological ICU at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Data of ICU patients with moderate to severe encephalopathy (Glasgow Coma Score < 13) that underwent EEG monitoring to rule out NCS were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 317 patients with encephalopathy who underwent EEG monitoring, 14.5% had NCS. Known risk factors such as sepsis, CNS infection, antibiotics, and cardiac arrest were not associated with increased risk of NCS. Patients with NCS were more likely to have received recent chemotherapy (41.3% vs 21.4%; p = 0.0036), have a CNS disease (39% vs 24.4%; p = 0.035), and abnormal brain imaging (60.9% vs 44.6%; p = 0.041). Patients with lower SOFA scores, normal renal function, and absence of shock were likely to have NCS as the cause of their encephalopathy (p < 0.03). After multivariate analysis, only abnormal brain imaging and absence of renal failure were associated with NCS. Mortality was significantly lower in patients with non-convulsive seizures when compared to those without seizures (45.7% vs 64%; p = 0.022); however, there was no significant association of seizures and mortality on a multivariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: NCS in critically ill cancer patients is associated with abnormalities on brain imaging and lower prevalence of organ failure. Diagnosis and treatment of NCS should be a priority in encephalopathic cancer patients, as they can have lower mortality than non-seizing patients. Opposite to other populations, NCS should not be considered a poor prognostic factor in critically ill encephalopathic cancer patients as they reflect a reversible cause for altered mentation."
41537617,[Experience of using mineral waters in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for the correction of endotoxinemia].,2025,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, special attention has been paid to the role of endotoxemia in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory processes and vascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) - increased levels of circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Endotoxemia occurs due to increased permeability of the intestinal barrier (""leaky gut syndrome"") and/or decreased activity of its elimination systems. Correction of endotoxemia is a promising direction in the complex therapy of DM1. Traditional approaches include strict glycemic control and the use of certain pharmacological agents, however, the search for effective non-pharmacological methods, such as the use of natural mineral waters, remains relevant. Despite the theoretical background, data on the effect of a course of mineral water intake on markers of endotoxemia and systemic inflammation in patients with DM1 are extremely limited. AIMS: to evaluate the effect of mineral waters on the state of LPS-binding systems, the level of circulating lipopolysaccharide and markers of inflammation in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 53 patients with a verified diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The intervention group (n=25), in addition to standard DM1 therapy, received non-carbonated therapeutic table mineral water ""Krymskaya mineralnaya"" produced by JSC ""Beer and Alcohol Plant ""Crimea"" for 150-200 ml 3 r/d. The second group was a control group, and consisted of 28 patients who were comparable in gender and age to the experimental group. ELISA kits were used to determine the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), zonulin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), including apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) manufactured by Cloud Clone Corp. (Wuhan, Hubei, China). RESULTS: In patients of group 1, after the use of mineral waters, a significant decrease in circulating LPS (p=0.029) and apoB-100 (p=0.002) was detected, as well as a statistically significant increase in LBP (p=0.009). There were no significant changes in the studied indicators in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that a 30-day course of taking ""Krymskaya"" mineral water in addition to standard insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus leads to a statistically significant decrease in the level of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key trigger of endotoxemia and chronic inflammation. The results obtained justify the expediency of further studying the use of mineral waters, in particular bicarbonate-chloride-sodium, as a component of complex non-pharmacological therapy aimed at correcting endotoxemia and improving the metabolic profile in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus."
20026493,Improved care and growth outcomes by using hybrid humidified incubators in very preterm infants.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in temperature, fluid and electrolyte management, growth, and short-term outcome in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants nursed in humidified hybrid incubators (HI group) compared with a cohort of patients cared for in nonhumidified conventional incubators (CI group). METHODS: Body temperature (BT), fluid and electrolyte balance, and growth velocity (GV) were collected retrospectively on 182 ELBW infants. The CI group included ELBW infants cared for with radiant warmers followed by an incubator without humidity. The HI group included ELBW infants cared for in the radiant warmer mode in a Giraffe OmniBed, followed by the incubator mode using high humidity. RESULTS: The CI group included more multiple births (50.6%) than the HI group (35.8%; P < .05), but there was no difference in demographic characteristics. BT was similar during the first week. The HI group had less fluid intake, urine output, and insensible water loss, less maximum weight loss, and a lower incidence of hypernatremia during the first week than did the CI group (P < .05). The HI group also had a lower frequency of electrolyte sampling and packed red cell transfusion (P < .05), a higher incidence of hyponatremia on postnatal day 1 than the CI group (P < .05), and a higher GV than the CI group (15.2 +/- 5.0 vs 13.5 +/- 4.8 g/kg per day), especially among those with a birth weight of <or=749 g (P < .01). There was no difference in sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and all bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but there was a decreased incidence of severe BPD (5.1% [HI] vs 16.4% [CI]; P < .05) and duration of assisted ventilation in the HI group compared with the CI group (15.5 +/- 2.1 vs 19.6 +/- 2.4 days, respectively; P = .068). CONCLUSIONS: Use of a humidified hybrid incubator improved care for ELBW infants by making it possible to decrease fluid intake, improve electrolyte balance, and enhance GV without a disturbance of BT compared with conventional care. By adjusting fluid intake when using these devices, benefits may be enhanced and the risk of BPD and severe BPD may be reduced."
15628636,Descending necrotizing mediastinitis: ten years' experience.,2004,"Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a rare disease that is usually caused by a spreading, diffuse inflammatory reaction (phlegmon) to an odontogenic infection or peritonsillar abscess. Reported mortality rates range from 25 to 40%. The use of antibiotics and advances in resuscitation procedures and critical care techniques have not essentially improved survival, and an effective treatment has not been clearly established. We report the findings of our 10-year study of 21 patients affected by phlegmon and/or fasciitis of the neck. The aim of our contribution is to help define the clinical criteria and diagnostic procedures that will improve the early diagnosis of mediastinal sepsis secondary to neck fasciitis and to suggest optimal treatment approaches. Our experience indicates that (1) cervical drainage alone is sufficient for cases of cervical phlegmon or mediastinal involvement that are limited to a single superior mediastinal space and (2) thoracotomy and drainage of mediastinal collections is necessary when mediastinal sepsis is more extensive."
19939271,Inter-rater reliability of malaria parasite counts and comparison of methods.,2009,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of artemesinin-based treatment for falciparum malaria has led to a shift away from symptom-based diagnosis. Diagnosis may be achieved by using rapid non-microscopic diagnostic tests (RDTs), of which there are many available. Light microscopy, however, has a central role in parasite identification and quantification and remains the main method of parasite-based diagnosis in clinic and hospital settings and is necessary for monitoring the accuracy of RDTs. The World Health Organization has prepared a proficiency testing panel containing a range of malaria-positive blood samples of known parasitaemia, to be used for the assessment of commercially available malaria RDTs. Different blood film and counting methods may be used for this purpose, which raises questions regarding accuracy and reproducibility. A comparison was made of the established methods for parasitaemia estimation to determine which would give the least inter-rater and inter-method variation METHODS: Experienced malaria microscopists counted asexual parasitaemia on different slides using three methods; the thin film method using the total erythrocyte count, the thick film method using the total white cell count and the Earle and Perez method. All the slides were stained using Giemsa pH 7.2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to find the inter-rater reliability for the different methods. The paired t-test was used to assess any systematic bias between the two methods, and a regression analysis was used to see if there was a changing bias with parasite count level. RESULTS: The thin blood film gave parasite counts around 30% higher than those obtained by the thick film and Earle and Perez methods, but exhibited a loss of sensitivity with low parasitaemia. The thick film and Earle and Perez methods showed little or no bias in counts between the two methods, however, estimated inter-rater reliability was slightly better for the thick film method. CONCLUSION: The thin film method gave results closer to the true parasite count but is not feasible at a parasitaemia below 500 parasites per microlitre. The thick film method was both reproducible and practical for this project. The determination of malarial parasitaemia must be applied by skilled operators using standardized techniques."
25504122,[Economic burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in critical care patients in hospitals in Bogota].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Resistant infections, especially those involving the bloodstream, are associated with a greater use of resources. Their estimates are variable and depend on the methodology used. Staphylococcus aureus is the main pathogen isolated in blood in our hospitals. There is no consolidated data about economic implications of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection. OBJECTIVE: To describe the cost of care of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia in a reference population from nine hospitals in Bogota. Materials y methods: A multicenter cohort study included 204 patients in a 1:1 ratio according to resistance. Direct medical costs were calculated from hospitalization bills, while the bacteremia period was calculated by applying microcosting based on standard fares. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between groups in demographic and clinical characteristics, except for resistance risk factors. Fifty-three percent of patients died during hospitalization. Hospital stay and total invoiced value during hospitalization were significantly higher in the group with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia. For this group, higher costs in ICU stay, antibiotics use, intravenous fluids, laboratory tests and respiratory support were recorded. A crude increase of 31% and an adjusted increase of 70% in care costs associated with methicillin resistance were registered. CONCLUSION: Our study supports decision makers in finding and funding infection prevention programs, especially those infections caused by resistant organisms."
25547047,Predictive value of the complement system for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation in septic patients in emergency department.,2015,"PURPOSE: To investigate changes in circulating complement component C3, membrane attack complex (MAC), and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult septic patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital were enrolled. A DIC score of 5 or higher was considered sepsis-induced DIC. Circulating C3, MAC, and MBL levels were detected on ED arrival and compared between patients with and without DIC. The predictive value of C3, MAC, and MBL for sepsis-induced DIC at ED arrival and development of DIC after admission were assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression. RESULTS: We enrolled 267 septic patients between February and December 2013. Complement 3, MAC, and MBL were higher in the DIC group (P < .01). Membrane attack complex was the independent predictor of sepsis-induced DIC. The area under the curve of MAC in predicting sepsis-induced DIC was 0.793. During hospitalization, 25 patients without DIC at enrollment developed DIC. Membrane attack complex and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment independently predicted progress to DIC. The area under the curve of MAC was 0.741. CONCLUSIONS: Complement 3, MAC, and MBL were significantly increased in septic patients with DIC. Membrane attack complex independently predicted sepsis-induced DIC and development of DIC after ED admission."
21083101,"First example of hepatocyte transplantation to alleviate ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, monitored by NMR-based metabonomics.",2009,"We demonstrate the effective use of NMR spectroscopic profiles of urine and plasma from the first successful use of hepatocyte transplantation as a bridge to auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation in a child antenatally diagnosed with severe ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. In this single-patient study, NMR profiles indicated that the disrupted urea cycle could be normalized by hepatocyte cell infusion and this was confirmed using orthogonal partial least-squares-based chemometrics. However, despite dietary manipulations and adminstration of ammonia scavengers, the desired reduction in plasma ammonia was not consistently achieved between sessions of hepatocyte transplantation due to episodes of sepsis. A subsequent liver transplant corrected the metabolic abnormalities. The use of metabolic profiling has been shown to be a promising method for evaluating the efficacy of cell infusions and has demonstrated the capability for the early detection of response to therapy in real time, an approach that may be of use in wider clinical settings."
25745560,Management of invasive candidiasis in nonneutropenic ICU patients.,2014,"Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among nonneutropenic ICU patients and these life-threatening nosocomial infections require early diagnosis and prompt treatment. However, none of the predictive tools are sufficiently accurate to identify high-risk patients and the potential interest of IC prophylactic, empirical and preemptive treatment in the nonneutropenic ICU population has not yet been demonstrated. In the case of nosocomial severe sepsis after necrotizing pancreatitis or upper digestive anastomotic leakage, early probabilistic antifungals are probably indicated. In the remaining ICU surgical and medical patients, prophylactic and empirical strategies are highly debated because they may promote antifungal selective pressure through an overuse of these molecules. In this context, non-culture-based methods such as mannan or beta-D glucan or polymerase chain reaction tests are promising. However, none of these tests used alone in ICU patients is sufficiently accurate to avoid overuse of empirical/preemptive treatment. The interest of strategies associating predictive clinical scores and non-culture-based methods still needs to be demonstrated by well-conducted randomized, controlled trials. While awaiting these studies, we consider that probabilist treatment should be stopped earlier if IC is not proven."
32117082,Genomic Analysis of Putative Virulence Factors Affecting Cytotoxicity of Cronobacter.,2019,"Cronobacter spp. can cause systemic infections, such as meningitis, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, in immunocompromised patients, especially neonates. Although some virulence factors have been reported previously, the pathogenesis of Cronobacter remains unclear. In this study, we compared genome sequences from different Cronobacter species, sequence types, and sources, with the virulence genes in the virulence factor database. The results showed that Cronobacter has species specificity for these virulence genes. Additionally, two gene clusters, including sfp encoding fimbriae and hly encoding hemolysin, were discovered. Through cell adhesion, cytotoxicity, and hemolysis assays, we found that the isolates possessing the two gene clusters had higher cytotoxicity and stronger hemolysis capacity than those of other isolates in this study. Moreover, analysis of type VI secretion system (T6SS) cluster and putative fimbria gene clusters of Cronobacter revealed that T6SS have species specificity and isolates with high cytotoxicity possessed more complete T6SS cluster construction than that of the rest. In conclusion, the two novel gene clusters and T6SS cluster were involved in the mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of Cronobacter."
15593011,Comparison of intermittent preventive treatment with chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of malaria during pregnancy in Mali.,2005,"BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy contributes to maternal anemia and low birth weight. In East Africa, several studies have demonstrated that intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is more efficacious than weekly chloroquine (CQ) chemoprophylaxis in preventing these adverse consequences. To our knowledge, there are no published trials evaluating IPT in West Africa. METHODS: We undertook a randomized controlled trial of weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis, 2-dose IPT with CQ, and 2-dose IPT with SP; 1163 women were enrolled. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, when compared with weekly CQ, IPT/SP was associated with a reduction in third-trimester anemia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.49; P<.001), placental parasitemia (AOR, 0.69; P=.04), and low birth weight (<2500 g) (AOR, 0.69; P=.04). The prevalence of placental infection remained unexpectedly high, even in the IPT/SP group (24.5%), possibly because of the intensity of seasonal transmission. There were no significant differences in stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, or neonatal deaths among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In Mali, IPT with SP appears more efficacious than weekly chloroquine chemoprophylaxis in preventing malaria during pregnancy. These data support World Health Organization recommendations to administer at least 2 doses of IPT during pregnancy. In intensely seasonal transmission settings in Mali, >2 doses may be required to prevent placental reinfection prior to delivery."
41407496,"Neisseria meningitidis bacteraemia and lobar pneumonia in a previously healthy, fully immunised (including meningococcal vaccines) Irish teenager.",2025,"An adolescent female patient presented to the Emergency Department of a large tertiary hospital in Ireland, with a 1-day history of chest and left axillary pain, and a 5-day history of productive cough, fever, reduced oral intake and lethargy; no previous medical history, sick contacts or recent travel. Vaccinations were up to date. Symptomatology, raised inflammatory markers, radiographic findings, coupled with relevant auscultatory findings, led to a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Less than 24 hours after presentation, Neisseria meningitidis was isolated from a blood culture, prompting patient isolation and commencement of high-dose ceftriaxone. Close contacts received prophylaxis, and public health authorities were notified. Meningococcal pneumonia, although infrequently seen in adults, has been reported in the paediatric population to date only rarely. This case serves as a reminder that meningococcal disease is notifiable, requiring prompt reporting to public health authorities, patient isolation and prophylaxis for close contacts. It also highlights meningococcal pneumonia as a cause of paediatric pneumonia, even in fully vaccinated, immunocompetent children, and the importance of obtaining blood samples for culture before commencing antibiotic therapy to maximise microbiological confirmation."
31826803,"[Association between peripheral perfusion, microcirculation and mortality in sepsis: a systematic review].",2019,"Although increasing evidence supports the monitoring of peripheral perfusion in septic patients, no systematic review has been undertaken to explore the strength of association between poor perfusion assessed in microcirculation of peripheral tissues and mortality. A search of the most important databases was carried out to find articles published until February 2018 that met the criteria of this study using different keywords: sepsis, mortality, prognosis, microcirculation and peripheral perfusion. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed association between peripheral perfusion/microcirculation and mortality in sepsis. The exclusion criteria adopted were: review articles, animal/pre-clinical studies, meta-analyzes, abstracts, annals of congress, editorials, letters, case-reports, duplicate and articles that did not present abstracts and/or had no text. In the 26 articles were chosen in which 2465 patients with sepsis were evaluated using at least one recognized method for monitoring peripheral perfusion. The review demonstrated a heterogeneous critically ill group with a mortality-rate between 3% and 71% (median = 37% [28%-43%]). The most commonly used methods for measurement were Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) (7 articles) and Sidestream Dark-Field (SDF) imaging (5 articles). The vascular bed most studied was the sublingual/buccal microcirculation (8 articles), followed by fingertip (4 articles). The majority of the studies (23 articles) demonstrated a clear relationship between poor peripheral perfusion and mortality. In conclusion, the diagnosis of hypoperfusion/microcirculatory abnormalities in peripheral non-vital organs was associated with increased mortality. However, additional studies must be undertaken to verify if this association can be considered a marker of the gravity or a trigger factor for organ failure in sepsis."
15787269,[Severe malaria in native adults in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire)].,2004,"Our retrospective study carried out from 1985 to 1998 in the Unit of Infectious Diseases in Abidjan aimed at describing the epidemiological, clinical and prognosis features of severe malaria among native adults. Within 14 years, we have listed 274 cases of severe malaria for 54 098 hospitalizations (0.5%). 164 men and 110 women were recorded (sex-ratio = 1.5), aged of 33 years (16-86), among them 48% were HIV positive. 23% of the patients had already received an antimalarial treatment. The main clinical presentation was cerebral malaria (78%). The other manifestations were respiratory symptoms (13%), kidney failure (11%), anaemia (11%), macroscopic haemoglobinuria (6%), hypoglycaemia (9%), cardiovascular shock (4%). The average parasite load in blood was 27 222 plasmodium/microl (25 000 - 180200). The treatment used was quinine IV (172 patients), and arthemeter (102 patients). The outcome was favourable in 232 cases (84%) and 42 patients died. Prognosis factors identified were age > 65 years, Glasgow coma score < 7, convulsions, cardio-vascular shock, macroscopic haemoglobinuria. HIV infection has not been identified as a pejorative factor Our results confirm that severe malaria in native adult is a reality in tropical area. This study shows how difficult it is to have an adequate care management regarding this pathology in our context."
19999665,[Update on current care guidelines. Treatment of severe sepsis in adults].,2009,"According to the Finnsepsis Study, the incidence in Finland of severe sepsis requiring intensive care was 0.38/1,000 inhabitants/year. ICU and hospital mortality was 15.5% and 28.3%, respectively. The Finnsepsis Study showed that compliance with protocols was rather poor and antimicrobial treatment was often delayed. These guidelines emphasize the importance of prompt antibiotic and fluid therapy. In shock, norepinephrine is the first line vasopressor. Low-dose hydrocortisone may be used to shorten the need for vasopressors. Activated protein C should be considered in selected patients. The blood glucose target recommendation is between 5 and 8 mmol/l."
26078649,Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Education and Research Hospital newborn hearing screening results and assessment of the patients.,2014,"AIM: Social, emotional, cognitive and language development of infants is provided with early diagnosis of hearing deficit. Hearing deficit is reported with a rate of 1-6 in 1000 live births in healthy newborns, while it reaches up to 10-30 in 1000 live births in newborns with risk factors. We aimed to compile the results of the hearing screening program applied in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of the hearing screening program were examined and the results were compiled by reaching the records of the patients who were found to have hearing deficit. RESULTS: Hearing test was applied in a total of 142 128 patients between 2005 and 2011. Hearing test was performed by evoked autoaucistic emission for two times in 26 690 of these patients and for three times in 2 412. A diagnosis of hearing deficit was made in 385 patients (0.27%) after application of ARB (Auditory Brainstem Response). The medical records of 171 of the patients who were referred for advanced investigations and treatment were obtained. 116 of these patients had a history of hospitalization in neonatal intensive care unit, while 55 patients had no history of hospitalization in neonatal intensive care unit. 49 of the patients had a gestational age below the 32(th) week and 122 had a gestational age above the 32(th) week. The median gestational age and birth weight values and ranges were found to be 35 (22-43) and 2 140 g (580-4 590 g), respectively. The risk factors included intrauterine growth retardation (n=24), multiple pregnancy (n=22), hyperbilirubinemia (n=74), blood exchange because of hyperbilirubinemia (n=7), sepsis (n=52), hypoglycemia (n=2), use of aminoglycoside and glycopeptide (n=99), use of furosemide (n=27), mechanical ventilation therapy (n=37), polycythemia (n=12), prenatal asphyxia (n=2), respiratory distress syndrome (n=45), chronic lung disease (n=11), surgery for retinopathy of prematurity (n=8) and hearing deficit in the mother or father (n=7). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the necessity of performing hearing screening in all newborns, infants with risk factors should be determined, hearing deficit should be screened with repeated hearing tests and social, emotional, cognitive and language development of the infant should be assured."
25504659,Identification of the severe sepsis patient at triage: a prospective analysis of the Australasian Triage Scale.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the accuracy and validity of the Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) as a tool to identify and manage in a timely manner the deteriorating patient with severe sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in five sites of adult patients. Keywords and physiological vital signs data from triage documentation were analysed for the 'identified' status compared with confirmed diagnosis of severe sepsis after admission to the intensive care unit. The primary outcome is the accuracy and validity of the ATS Triage scale categories to identify a prespecified severe sepsis population at triage. Secondary outcome measures included time compliance, antimicrobial administration and mortality prediction. Statistical analysis included parameters of diagnostic performance. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to mortality prediction. RESULTS: Of 1022 patients meeting the criteria for severe sepsis, 995 were triaged through the emergency department, 164 with shock. Only 53% (n=534) were identified at triage. The overall sensitivity of the ATS to identify severe sepsis was 71%. ATS 3 was the most accurate (likelihood ratio positive, 2.45, positive predictive value 0.73) and ATS 2 the most valid (area under the curve 0.567) category. Identified cases were more likely to survive (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.697 to 0.94, p<0.007). The strongest bias-adjusted predictors of mortality were circulatory compromise variable (1.78, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.41, p<0.001), lactate >4 (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, p<0.001) and ATS 1 category (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.35, p<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The ATS and its categories is a sensitive and moderately accurate and valid tool for identifying severe sepsis in a predetermined group, but lacks clinical efficacy and safety without further education or quality improvement strategies targeted to the identification of severe sepsis."
41425961,The non-linear association between creatinine-to-albumin ratio and medium-term mortality in patients with sepsis accompanied by acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database and external validation.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the Creatinine to Albumin Ratio (CAR) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database (v2.2) to analyze data from 2,712 adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and AKI. External validation was performed using a single-center cohort of 412 patients from Ningbo No. 2 Hospital (January 2022-December 2024). Patients were stratified into quartiles based on CAR values. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the consistency of CAR's prognostic utility across various patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Infection types were categorized based on ICD-9/10 codes into pulmonary, abdominal, urinary tract, bloodstream, and other infections. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were excluded to minimize confounding by pre-existing renal impairment. RESULTS: Among 2,712 included patients, those in the highest CAR quartile (Q4) had the lowest survival probability. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in mortality across quartiles (log-rank P<0.001). In fully adjusted Cox models that included newly incorporated metabolic and hemodynamic variables (electrolytes, lactate, and vasopressors use), both continuous CAR (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.16, P = 0.048; ICU mortality: HR = 1.18, P = 0.044) and Q4 (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.72, P<0.001; ICU mortality: HR = 1.61, P<0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality risk. RCS analysis revealed a J-shaped relationship with ICU mortality, with an inflection point at CAR = 1.2 mg/dL. External validation confirmed CAR's prognostic value for 30-day mortality, with consistent associations observed in the validation cohort (Hospital mortality: HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.43, P = 0.032). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed strong early predictive accuracy (7-day AUC = 0.75). Subgroup analyses confirmed CAR's robust prognostic value, which remained consistent across different infection types and was particularly pronounced in older, obese, and mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: CAR is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in sepsis-associated AKI, with both continuous measurements and the highest quartile (Q4) demonstrating significant associations after comprehensive adjustment for metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. The identified threshold (CAR = 1.2 mg/dL) enhances its clinical utility. While CAR provides independent prognostic information, its modest effect sizes suggest it should be used as a complementary tool rather than a standalone predictor. CAR's simplicity and accessibility make it a valuable adjunct for risk stratification in this high-risk population."
41430733,Systematic review and meta-analysis of humoral immunity proteins and mortality in sepsis.,2025,"PURPOSE: Humoral immunity proteins-immunoglobulins, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides-have key antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions in sepsis. We hypothesised that their circulating levels are lower in non-survivors, potentially resulting in impaired bacterial clearance and persistent or recurrent infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating differences in humoral immunity proteins between survivors and non-survivors in adult patients with sepsis. PubMed and Embase were searched without date restrictions. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analyses included data from the MIMIC-IV ICU database, and further supplemented by three proteomic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies including 6,330 patients were analysed. Thirteen reported on immunoglobulins, 17 on complement proteins, and 7 on the antimicrobial peptide heparin-binding protein (HBP). Survivors had significantly higher levels of complement proteins C3 (SMD 0.53 [0.07-0.99]) and C4 (SMD 0.51 [0.09-0.94]) compared to non-survivors. Conversely, C4a (SMD - 1.17 [-1.77 to - 0.56]) and IgA (SMD - 0.21 [-0.39 to - 0.03]) were significantly lower in survivors. No differences were found for IgG (SMD 0.00 [-0.18 to 0.18]), IgM (SMD - 0.02 [-0.13 to 0.08]), C5, C5a, or HBP. Sensitivity analyses using MIMIC-IV (n = 2,452) and proteomic datasets supported these findings. Proteomic data revealed early depletion of classical complement components (C3, C4B) and regulatory proteins in non-survivors. CONCLUSION: Sepsis non-survivors exhibit lower C3 and C4 levels and higher C4a, consistent with complement activation and/or depletion. Complement proteins may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in sepsis."
25573307,[Clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients with co-activation of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) co-activation on the prognosis of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 330 consecutive allo-HSCT patients at First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 2011 to August 2013. CMV and EBV DNA were regularly monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the engraftment of granuloCyte within one year after transplantation. The incidences of viremia and clinical outcomes were analyzed by chi(2) test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 16 (7-25) months, a total of 113 (34.2%) patients were identified with CMV viremia (CMV+) alone, 82 (24.8%) with EBV viremia (EBV+) alone and 32 (9.7%) with CMV and EBV co-activation (CMV/EBV+). The proportion of patients undergoing HLA mismatched transplantation and ones with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in CMV/EBV+ group was significantly higher than CMV+ group or EBV+ group (78.1% (25/32) vs 58.5% (48/82) or 50.4% (57/113), P = 0.047,0.008; 56.3% (18/32) vs 32.9% (27/82) or 34.5% (39/113) , P = 0.022, 0.026) . The incidence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was similar to EBV+ group (12.5% (4/32) vs 11.0% (9/82) , P = 0.802) and so did the incidence of CMV disease when compared with CMV+ group (9.4% (3/32) vs 7.1% (8/113) , P = 0.665). The 2-year overall survival (OS) of CMV+, EBV+ and CMV/EBV+ groups was 68.7%, 61.5% and 62.4% respectively. And no significant difference existed between CMV/EBV+ and the other two groups (P = 0.598, 0.717). However, the 6-month non-relapse mortality (NRM) of CMV/EBV+ group was significantly higher than that of CMV+ or EBV+ group (18.7% vs 8.9%, P = 0.036; 18.7% vs 8.1%, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: HLA mismatch transplants and aGVHD are frequent in CMV and EBV co-activation group. When compared with EBV+ or CMV+ patients, the CMV/EBV+ patients have similar incidence of PTLD or CMV disease and 2-year OS.However, the 6-month NRM is significantly higher in CMV/EBV+ group. It suggests that CMV and EBV co-activation is a risk factor for early mortality of allo-HSCT patients."
41438836,Practice and attitudes of infection control staff towards diagnostic stewardship measures.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, diagnostic stewardship has gained importance worldwide as part of antibiotic stewardship and infection control programs. However, the specific involvement of infection control (IC) teams in this area has not been studied. METHOD: A volunteer survey of participants at the 2024 Freiburg Conference on Infection Prevention and Therapy was conducted to assess attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic stewardship. RESULTS: The majority of the 182 participants worked in German hospitals with established IC-committees (91.2%), antibiotic stewardship teams (43.4%), and laboratory commissions (24.7%).For sepsis diagnosis, at least two pairs of blood cultures are usually taken, which is in line with the guidelines; 14.3% use the ""six-pack"" rule (three pairs), and 28.6% take all cultures from one puncture site. For many clinical tests -except of stool tests and C-reactive protein - less than 50% rated their use as ""appropriate"", indicating a need for improvement. Interleukin 6 and beta-D-glucan are rarely used.Strategies such as reflex tests and cascade reporting are only used occasionally and are viewed with scepticism in some cases. Screening for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin resistant enterococci was rated as ""appropriate"" by over 60%, while screening for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria was rated as such by 50%. In the area of IC, 32.4% reported inadequate sampling of surfaces and 33.2% of staff hands. DISCUSSION: Subjective assessments and a heterogeneous participant structure limit the survey, and subgroup analyses are not possible due to the small number of cases. However, the results show chances for education and integration of IC teams in diagnostic stewardship programs."
41444865,Hemodynamic subphenotypes in septic shock and their different responses to fluid balance in relation to ICU mortality.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Hemodynamically unstable septic patients often require aggressive fluid resuscitation, but limited evidence exists on which hemodynamic subphenotypes benefit most. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary hospital of China. Patients with septic shock who underwent pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring within 24 h were included from November 2013 to January 2024. We applied latent profile modelling to identify subphenotypes using all hemodynamic parameters monitored via PiCCO. We then tested the association of 48-h fluid balance with ICU mortality in different subphenotypes using logistic regression. RESULT: A total of 691 patients were included. Latent profile models indicated that a four-profile model was the best fit. Hyperdynamic subphenotype (phenotype1) was characterized by highest cardiac output and lowest systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI); high preload subphenotype (phenotype 2) was characterized by highest preload; hypodynamic subphenotype (phenotype 3) was characterised by lowest cardiac output, highest SVRI, lung function, as well as inotropic score; preserved subphenotype (phenotype 4) was presented with relative normal hemodynamic parameters. No significant difference was observed in 24- and 48-hour fluid balance among subphenotypes, and overall, no significant correlation was found between 48-hour fluid balance and ICU mortality. However, a significant interaction existed between 48-hour fluid balance and phenotype 4; in this group, higher fluid balance at 48 h was associated with increased ICU mortality (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Four hemodynamic subphenotypes in septic shock was identified. The impact of 48-hour fluid balance on ICU mortality varied by subphenotype, with increased mortality observed only in the preserved hemodynamic group."
25528733,Is vaginal hysterectomy is equally safe for the enlarged and normally sized non-prolapse uterus? A cohort study assessing outcomes.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: Gynecologists are reluctant to perform vaginal hysterectomy if the uterine size exceeds 12 weeks in the belief that complications could be higher in this group. The aim of this cohort control study was to compare demographics, surgical outcomes and safety of vaginal hysterectomy in women with non-prolapsed uteri weighing >280 g (>12 weeks size) to those with uteri weighing <280 g removed vaginally for similar indications. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, classified as Canadian Task Force II (cohort-control), the index group comprised 41 women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy for non-prolapse indications with uterine enlargement >280 g (12 weeks), while the control group consisted of 66 women with uteri <280 g. Demographic data as well as duration of surgery, blood loss, intraoperative complications and readmission rates were compared. RESULTS: Women in the two groups had statistically similar mean age, body mass index and parity (47.7 vs 44.9 yrs, 30.3 vs 32.4 kg m(-3) and 2.8 vs 2.4, respectively; p>0.05). The mean operative time was significantly longer in the index group (123.3+/-43.2 vs 85+/-32.1 min; p=1.47x10(-6)). Women with enlarged uteri had greater mean estimated blood loss (402.8+/-402.2 vs 160.8+/-123.2 ml; p<0.0001) but the mean length of stay was similar (45.4+/-28.7 vs 37.6+/-26.2 h; p>0.05). Two uteri weighing >1000 g were removed vaginally. Intra- and post-operative complications such as bladder injury, blood transfusion and pelvic sepsis were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal hysterectomy in larger non-prolapsed uteri takes longer (mean 38 min longer) and is associated with more blood loss (mean increase 242 ml) compared to normal-sized uteri but is not associated with a significant increase in complication rates."
15599649,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of occult bacteremia in an adult emergency department in Spain: influence of blood culture results on changes in initial diagnosis and empiric antibiotic treatment.,2004,"A prospective study was carried out to analyze the usefulness of blood culture results for adult patients who were discharged from the emergency department with bacteremia. Over a 29-month period, 110 patients with significant bacteremia who were seen in the emergency department and discharged home were studied. The mean age of the patients was 61.8 years. The most frequent initial major diagnosis was urinary tract infection (UTI) (n=63; 57.3%). Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 79 (71.8%) cases. A change in diagnosis (44.5% cases) was more common when the initial diagnosis was something other than UTI or when empiric antimicrobial therapy was ineffective or was not given (P<0.001). The significant predictors of modification of the initial empiric antibiotic therapy were ineffective empiric antimicrobial therapy and transfer of the patient from the emergency department to an infectious diseases outpatient clinic (P=0.01). Blood culture results may be useful for achieving the correct diagnosis in adult patients with bacteremia and for guiding treatment in the subsequent management of outpatients."
20013016,"Factors related to survival and treatment success in invasive candidiasis or candidemia: a pooled analysis of two large, prospective, micafungin trials.",2010,"Crude and attributable mortality rates in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis remain unacceptably high. It is important to reach a more complete understanding of the risk factors underlying poor outcomes in patients with invasive Candida infections. Micafungin therapy has been assessed in two phase 3 trials compared to either liposomal amphotericin B or caspofungin. The availability of this large dataset allows the analyses of non-drug factors associated with survival and treatment success. A multivariate regression analysis was performed on data from the two trials separately and as a pooled analysis (N = 1,070). Analysis outcomes were survival at 42 days post-initiation of therapy and treatment success. For the pooled analysis, treatment success was significantly more likely for candidemia than invasive candidiasis. Both survival and treatment success were significantly less likely for the non-removal of catheter versus removal, Asian-Indians versus Caucasians, APACHE II score >20 to <or=30 and >30 versus <or=20, age >or=70 years versus <50 years, baseline corticosteroids, and persistent neutropenia. Survival was also significantly less likely for treatment in other regions versus North America and for patients with renal failure at baseline. These findings help to define non-antifungal drug factors that may impact survival and treatment success in invasive candidiasis or candidemia."
41631218,An Unusual Case of Lithium-Induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus.,2025,"We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with bipolar affective disorder on long-term lithium therapy who presented with confusion, acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency, with suspected urinary sepsis. Initial assessment revealed very high C-reactive protein (CRP), severe hyperglycemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI Stage 3). She was treated for urinary sepsis as computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis, and Escherichia coli was isolated from blood cultures. Lithium was withheld initially due to renal impairment. As she met diagnostic criteria for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), she was treated as per the hospital hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state protocol. Glycemic control improved with appropriate fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. When renal function improved, lithium was restarted due to behavioral deterioration, following which she developed polyuria, severe hypernatremia, and persistently elevated serum osmolality. Due to severe agitation, she required intensive care unit (ICU) support for clinical and biochemical monitoring. Despite the resolution of hyperglycemia, persistent polyuria and hypernatremia prompted suspicion of diabetes insipidus (DI). Elevated serum sodium, high serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality were consistent with the diagnosis of DI. Normal brain imaging, elevated baseline co-peptin, and no response to desmopressin excluded central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and supported nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) secondary to chronic lithium use. She was treated with thiazide diuretics, with significant improvement in her urine output and stabilization of serum sodium. Lithium was discontinued, and referral to psychiatry was arranged. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge in differentiating osmotic diuresis of HHS from lithium-induced NDI and emphasizes the need for clinical suspicion of NDI in patients on lithium therapy presenting with polyuria and electrolyte disturbances."
25665343,Poor ED lab tracking and reporting system results in sepsis treatment delay.,2014,"This case underscores the need to have reliable systems in place to ensure that EDs have: policies in place fore re-assessing patients at discharge, a procedure for describing how vital signs are assessed prior to disposition and how abnormal findings are addressed, a requirement to document the review of vital signs prior to disposition; a requirement for documenting the rationale for continuing with the planned course of action if the vital signs and lab reports that are subsequently reported show anything that is abnormal. Patient re-evaluation is central to high-quality care and to strengthen the physician's ability to make an accurate and timely diagnosis in the ED setting. It is important to understand the significance of ongoing patient monitoring and reassessment, maintaining reliable diagnostic tracking and reporting systems, managing timely call-back systems, and ensuring that the ED team of staff and physicians are well-trained and oriented to hospital policies, procedures, and technology."
15578191,Impaired mucosal regeneration in neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.,2005,"Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains an overwhelming gastrointestinal (GI) emergency in premature infants, with an annual incidence of 350 cases and a mortality of 23% in the United Kingdom. The aetiology of NEC is multifactorial and its pathogenesis poorly understood. It is characterised by severe necrotic damage to the intestine. Mucus is an adherent, viscoelastic gel layer protecting the delicate underlying epithelium from lumenal aggressors such as digestive enzymes and bacterial toxins. The group of trefoil factor peptides (TFF1-3) are part of the protective mechanism operating in the intestinal mucosa and play a fundamental role in epithelial protection, repair, and restitution. These secreted peptides have been identified in a site-specific pattern in the GI mucosa, and their expression has been shown to be upregulated in early stages of mucosal repair. The role of trefoil peptides in neonatal mucosal protection has not been well investigated. Impaired mucosal regeneration due in part to failure of upregulation of TFF expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. The aim of this study was to investigate TFF1-3 mRNA expression and to identify the gene product in the GI tracts of normal neonatal controls and infants with NEC. Parents of all babies having a laparotomy in the neonatal period (defined as up to 44 weeks' gestation) and bowel resection were approached for written consent. Bowel samples were fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin in an RNAse-free manner. In situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine the pattern of trefoil mRNA expression and to localise the peptides in the neonatal GI tract. Forty neonatal bowel specimens were examined. Twelve patients had NEC, eight were recovering from NEC, and 20 control specimens were obtained. TFF1 and TFF2 mRNA expression were not detected in the majority of NEC specimens, and there was a relative downregulation of TFF3 expression in 83% of NEC patients. TFF1 and TFF2 expression were noted in the recovery phase from NEC. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease in TFF3 gene product in sites adjacent to mucosal damage secondary to NEC. In acute NEC there was no apparent expression of TFF1 and 2 protein. In the group of patients recovering from NEC, TFF1 and 2 expression were seen in association with regenerative changes in the mucosa. Previous data has shown TFF1-3 to be upregulated in the acute phase response to mucosal injury in the gut. Trefoil peptides have been shown to promote epithelial cell migration and protect against apoptosis. Our results suggest that there is a lack of TFF expression in response to NEC in the premature gut. This may lead to impaired restitution of the mucosa and contribute to the cascade of bowel necrosis and generalised sepsis characteristic of NEC."
20003486,Phlegmonous colitis: another source of sepsis in cirrhotic patients?,2009,"BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of phlegmonous colitis (PC), a rare autopsy finding in cirrhotic patients, is poorly documented. We postulated that PC might be a source of sepsis in patients with portal hypertensive colopathy (PHC). CASE PRESENTATION: We report three cirrhotic patients who were admitted with abdominal sepsis and who illustrate, to various degrees, the clinico-pathological sequence of colonic alterations associated with portal hypertension. Two cirrhotic patients with PHC developed gram-negative bacteraemia and quickly responded to intravenous antibiotics. Another cirrhotic patient underwent emergency colectomy for PC, and subsequently died from multiple organ failure. Histological alterations in the operative specimen included: a) mucosal ulcerations; b) disseminated micro-abscesses in the submucosa; and c) a severe vasculopathy leading to complete obliteration of submucosal blood vessels. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cirrhotic patients with PHC may progress towards PC, which, in turn, may be the cause for life-threatening sepsis."
31814327,beta-Blockade attenuates renal blood flow in experimental endotoxic shock by reducing perfusion pressure.,2019,"Clinical data suggests that heart rate (HR) control with selective beta1-blockers may improve cardiac function during septic shock. However, it seems counterintuitive to start beta-blocker infusion in a shock state when organ blood flow is already low or insufficient. Therefore, we studied the effects of HR control with esmolol, an ultrashort- acting beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, on renal blood flow (RBF) and renal autoregulation during early septic shock. In 10 healthy sheep, sepsis was induced by continuous i.v. administration of lipopolysaccharide, while maintained under anesthesia and mechanically ventilated. After successful resuscitation of the septic shock with fluids and vasoactive drugs, esmolol was infused to reduce HR with 30% and was stopped 30-min after reaching this target. Arterial and venous pressures, and RBF were recorded continuously. Renal autoregulation was evaluated by the response in RBF to renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in both the time domain and frequency domain. During septic shock, beta-blockade with esmolol significantly increased the pressure dependency of RBF to RPP. Stopping esmolol showed the reversibility of the impaired renal autoregulation. Showing that clinical diligence and caution are necessary when treating septic shock with esmolol in the acute phase since esmolol reduced RPP to critical values thereby significantly reducing RBF."
15700685,[Evaluation of justification for antibiotic use at the Internal Medicine Clinic of the Clinical Hospital in Zagreb].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: Resistance to antimicrobials as the result of unnecessary and inadequate use of antibiotics has become a global health problem. It is estimated that up to 50% of antimicrobials are used unnecessarily, and that they are the cause of approximately 25% of adverse drug reactions. Efforts are made to ensure a controlled use of antibiotics, which is the key strategy against development of resistance to antimicrobials. Since antimicrobial drugs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in hospitals, a rational use of antibiotics would also help reduce health care costs. There are limited data on the use of antibiotics in Croatian hospitals. METHODS: This observational study was conducted at the University Department of Medicine, Zagreb University Hospital Center, with the aim to investigate the prevalence of antimicrobial use, indications for antibiotic use, and the necessity and adequacy of antibiotic therapy. The investigated parameters were: prescribed antibiotic (dose, route of administration, duration of therapy), indication for use of antibiotics (prophylaxis, treatment), diagnosis, presence of positive culture, indication documented in medical records, evaluation of antibiotic therapy by a specialist, and risk factors. The most important parameter in the evaluation of the necessity of antimicrobial use was the presence of culture days of treatment, and indication for treatment documented in medical records and evaluated by a specialist. The data were collected over 1 day using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty of 138 (37%) hospitalized patients were receiving 1 or more antibiotics, most of them (80%) for the treatment of infection. The most frequent diagnoses were sepsis (64%), urinary tract infection (25%), abdominal infection (21%), and pulmonary infection (7%). The median therapy duration was 4 days (minimum 1 day, maximum 121 days). The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were fluoroquinolones (23%), penicillins (23%), aminoglycosides (18%) and cephalosporins (11%). Thirty-nine patients received one or more reserve antibiotics. The median number of received antibiotics was 2 (minimum 1, maximum 5 antibiotics). Risk factors were present in 76% of patients. Fifty-nine percent patients were receiving antibiotics on the basis of culture; in most of them therapy was evaluated by a specialist (98%) and the indication was documented in medical records. Reserve antibiotics were prescribed in 34 patients, in 77% of them on the basis of positive culture. CONCLUSION: The high prescription rate of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones), concomitant use of antibiotics of a similar spectrum of activity and lack of sequential therapy emerged to be the parameters needing further evaluation. Other investigated parameters (number of antibiotics, duration of therapy, necessity of antibiotic therapy) were in accordance with similar studies conducted in hospitals. Further investigation with emphasis on local problems and prescription habits with the aim to optimize the use of antibiotics is needed."
15588359,The frequency of withdrawal from acute care is impacted by severe acute renal failure.,2004,"INTRODUCTION: In the general intensive care setting, decisions to withdraw life support when patients deteriorate despite aggressive treatment are estimated to occur in 10% of all patients and in 40% of the patients who die. Acute renal failure (ARF) severe enough to necessitate renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with in-hospital mortality approximating 50%. Yet the impact of severe ARF on decisions to withdraw treatment has not been previously described. In chronic renal failure patients, voluntary withdrawal from maintenance dialysis occurs in 10%-20% of patients when increasing complications and poor quality of life ensue, and knowing these data facilitates discussions with patients and families. Having similar data for complicated ARF would facilitate decision making for families and caregivers when these difficult situations arise. METHODS: All cases of ARF requiring RRT during 2000-2001 at University of Michigan Hospital (n = 383) were entered prospectively into an outcome study at the time RRT was initiated. Comprehensive data collection included demographic and clinical characteristics, outcome and complications, and severity of illness. Additional information for patients who died included cause of death, life-support withdrawal decisions, and the presence of prior advance directives. RESULTS: Overall mortality in severe ARF (i.e., severe enough to require RRT) was 53%. Life-support withdrawal occurred in 72% of deaths (compared to 40%-50% reported among general intensive care cases) and was associated with intensive care stay well beyond 2 weeks. Severity of illness, as indicated by modified APACHE III scores, was higher in patients who died than in survivors, but severity of illness was not higher for withdrawal from treatment than death without withdrawal decisions. Life-support withdrawal was not associated with other demographic or clinical characteristics (hospital service, primary admitting diagnosis, ventilator or pressor dependence, sepsis, or initial type of RRT chosen). Prior advance directives were available in 29% of patients overall, but having advance directives did not predict withdrawal from acute treatment. Death occurred within 2 days of withdrawal in more than 90% of cases, emphasizing the severity of underlying illness. CONCLUSIONS: Severe ARF reflects the severity of underlying illness, impacts overall survival, and is associated with more frequent withdrawal from aggressive treatment. High severity of illness and prolonged intensive care without improvement beyond 2 weeks presage decisions to withdraw treatment and signal patients and caregivers that death is imminent and that further aggressive care should be reconsidered or limited."

She was successfully treated with emergency open subtotal cholecystectomy. This case highlights the critical importance of early diagnosis and coordinated multidisciplinary intervention to prevent life-threatening outcomes."
26484123,Gene expression profiling of mononuclear cells from patients with sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.,2014,"Mechanisms governing the inflammatory response during sepsis involve crosstalk between diverse signaling pathways, but current knowledge provides an incomplete picture of the syndrome. Microarray-based expression profiling is a powerful approach for the investigation of complex clinical conditions such as sepsis. In this study, we investigated whole-genome expression profiles in mononuclear cells from septic patients admitted in intensive care units with community-acquired pneumonia. Blood samples were collected at the time of sepsis diagnosis and seven days later since we aimed to evaluate the role of biological processes or genes possibly involved in patient recovery. Here we provide a detailed description of the study design, including clinical information, experimental methods and procedures regarding data analysis. Metadata corresponding to microarray results deposited in the database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE48080 are also described in this report. Our dataset allows the identification of genes possibly associated with host defense to infection as well as gene expression patterns associated with patient outcome."
25532536,Early changes of the kinetics of monocyte trem-1 reflect final outcome in human sepsis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells), a receptor expressed on neutrophils and monocytes, is upregulated in sepsis and seems to tune the inflammatory response. We explored the expression of TREM-1 at the gene level and on cell membranes of monocytes and association with clinical outcome. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was sampled from 75 septic patients (39 patients with sepsis, 25 with severe sepsis and 11 with septic shock) on sepsis days 1, 3 and 7. TREM-1 on monocytes was measured by flow cytometry; gene expression of TREM-1 in circulating mononuclear cells was assessed by real-time PCR. sTREM-1 was measured in serum by an enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Although surface TREM-1, sTREM-1 and TREM-1 gene expression did not differ between sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock on day 1, survivors had greater expression of surface TREM-1 on days 3 and 7 compared to non-survivors. sTREM-1 on non-survivors decreased on day 3 compared to baseline. Patients with increase of monocyte gene expression of TREM-1 from day 1 to day 3 had prolonged survival compared to patients with decrease of gene expression of TREM-1 from day 1 to day 3 (p: 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Early decrease of gene expression of TREM-1 in monocytes is associated with poor outcome. A reciprocal decrease of the pro-inflammatory surface receptor TREM-1 linked with sepsis-induced immunosuppression may be part of the explanation."
20046102,"An active microbiological surveillance project at an Italian teaching hospital: microbial isolates, recent epidemiological trends, major clinical concerns, and antimicrobial susceptibility rates during a four-year period.",2009,"A microbiological surveillance program is currently performed at our tertiary-care teaching hospital. The temporal trend of microbial isolates from patients admitted during four calendar years (2004 to 2007) was analyzed according to the main bacterial and fungal culture organisms. The same pathogens isolated more than once from the same patient within one month were considered only once. On the whole, the main pathogen group remained that of Enterobacteriaceae (6,608 isolations out of 19,666: 33.6%, with Escherichia coli found in 60-75% of cases), with no significant difference over time. Staphylococci (4,150 isolates), and enterococci (3,276 isolates) were the two largest groups after Enterobacteriaceae, but staphylococci significantly declined during the four-year period (p .001), mainly due to progressively reduced isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci. By contrast, a slight increase in enterococci occurred (p .05). Based on the frequency of isolation, Gram-negative oxidase-positive organisms accounted for 2,109 episodes, followed by other aerobic Gram-positive organisms other than Staphylococci-Enterococci (613 isolates), and anaerobes (583 isolates): no significant variations occurred over time for these last microbial groups. With regard to Gram-negative oxidase-negative microorganisms (567 isolates), non-beta-haemolytic streptococci (464 cases) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (260 isolates), a significant reduction of frequency occurred from 2004 to 2007 (p.05 to p.001). Finally, fungal infections accounted for 1,036 overall episodes, in over 80% of cases represented by Candida spp. Prospective microbiological monitoring is expected to contribute significantly to our knowledge of local epidemiological figures and antimicrobial sensitivity profile of hospital infections, and plays a major role in selecting both treatment and chemoprophylaxis schedules, especially on a local-regional basis. Although the major causative agents of in-patient infections remain Enterobacteriaceae, a significant decline in coagulase-negative Staphylococci, all Streptococci, and Gram-negative oxidase-negative organisms occurred over the four-year period, while Enterococci showed a mild increase over time."

In recent years, breakthrough investigations with regard to the regulation and signaling mechanisms of SESN2 have markedly deepened our understanding of its potential role as well as its significance in host response. However, the functions of SESN2 in the immune system and inflammation remain elusive. It has been documented that many immune cells positively express SESN2 and, in turn, that SESN2 might modulate cellular activities. This review incorporates recent progress and aims to provide novel insight into the protective role and regulatory pathway of SESN2, which acts as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in the context of various diseases."
31839334,Rapid microbial identification and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from positive blood cultures: a new platform compared to routine laboratory methods.,2020,"The Accelerate Pheno System (APS), a new platform that combines rapid identification (ID) of bacteria and yeasts and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in a single assay, has been evaluated directly from positive blood cultures in comparison to routine laboratory methods. The APS ID results showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 99.6%, respectively. With regard to AST results, 31 discrepancies (8 single errors and 23 combined errors) were observed, including 13 major errors (3.3%) and 18 minor errors (4.6%) mainly involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No very major error was observed. The APS ID results were obtained in 1.5 h and the AST results were available in 7 h, on average 34.1 h before routine laboratory methods. This reduction in AST time-to-result represents one of the main advantages of this technology, reducing the time to provide to the physician the microbiological report."
15654137,Chromobacterium violaceum septicaemia from north India.,2004,"Though Chromobacterium violaceum is a common inhabitant of soil and water in tropical and sub-tropical regions, human infections are rare but when they do occur result in high mortality. Since the first case from Malaysia in 1927, about 150 cases have been reported in world literature. Till date 6 cases have been reported from southern and eastern parts of India. We report here a case of C. violaceum septicaemia, probably the first case from north India. The patient, a 6 and a half year old boy was admitted with high fever. The patient had anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis and bilateral chest infiltrates. Routine and bacteriological investigations were carried out to establish the aetiological diagnosis. C. violaceum was isolated in pure culture from blood and pus. The patient was successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and amikacin. This is probably the first documented case report of C. violaceum infection from north India and the only Indian case with septicaemia which survived."
17265608,A study of neonatal morbidity and mortality at Damanhour Teaching Hospital Newborn Unit.,2004,"Newborns in Behira governorate represented 2.5% of total Behira population in 2000. In Damanhour teaching hospital 4040 live births were delivered during one year from 1st January 1995 to 31st December 1995. During this period an observational study of morbidity and mortality of the newborn unit (NBU) attendants was performed. The total number of admitted neonates to the newborn unit were 557, of those 307 were borne in hospital (representing 7.6% of total hospital deliveries) and 250 were admitted from outside the hospital. The number of eligible neonates for the study were 544, they spent 2355 days in the unit, thirteen neonates were excluded from the analysis. The low birth weight (< 2500 gm) were 218 (40% of studied cases). According to Dubowitz score, Infants were classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA) 60.7%, small for gestational age (SGA) 27.6% and large for gestational age (LGA) 11.8%. Neonates with birth weight < 1500 gm and gestational age < 28 weeks had the worst prognosis with a mortality rate of 60.3% and 65.1% respectively. All neonates had 738 morbid conditions, the major causes were prematurity 262 (35.5%), respiratory distress (RD) 200 (27%) hyperbilirubinaemia 115 (15.6%) and sepsis 58 (7.9%). Most of the cases (73.9%) were admitted on the day of birth. The mortality rate was 28.5%. The leading causes of mortality were, RD ( 34.8% of all deaths), prematurity (32.9%) and sepsis (15.5%). Neonatal convulsions and congenital anomalies had highest case fatality rates (50% for each). Most of deaths (51%) occurred on the first day of admission.

Present and future"" 7-9 November 2001""."
41433402,A short antimicrobial peptides family demonstrates efficacy to infection via a multimodal mechanism of action.,2026,"The escalating threat posed by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative ""superbugs"" has intensified. Short antimicrobial peptides (SAMPs) have emerged as promising therapeutics with sustained potency and cost-effectiveness against drug-resistant infections. Here, we report a family of 15-residue SAMPs derived through modifying related amino acids of Kassporin-KS1 (FA), utilizing database-filtering technology to identify the most probable structural parameters related to Gram-negative bacteria. Most SAMPs exhibit sub-muM antimicrobial activity with reliable stability and low toxicity. Notably, KR and RK demonstrate significant efficacy in combating biofilms and sepsis infections in vivo. Furthermore, the acquisition of resistance by strains to SAMPs was not observed, primarily due to the multimodal antimicrobial mechanisms of SAMPs. We revealed that the multimodal mechanisms of SAMPs encompass unregulated membrane destabilization, induction of apoptotic-like death pathway, and interference with normal physiological processes. Overall, the rational design strategies proposed herein can be implemented to develop potent antimicrobial agents targeting MDR bacteria."
20002097,Procalcitonin in sepsis and systemic inflammation: a harmful biomarker and a therapeutic target.,2010,"The worldwide yearly mortality from sepsis is substantial, greater than that of cancer of the lung and breast combined. Moreover, its incidence is increasing, and its response to therapy has not appreciably improved. In this condition, the secretion of procalcitonin (ProCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, is augmented greatly, attaining levels up to thousands of fold of normal. This hypersecretion emanates from multiple tissues throughout the body that are not traditionally viewed as being endocrine. The serum values of ProCT correlate with the severity of sepsis; they recede with its improvement and worsen with exacerbation. Accordingly, as highlighted in this review, serum ProCT has become useful as a biomarker to assist in the diagnosis of sepsis, as well as related infectious or inflammatory conditions. It is also a useful monitor of the clinical course and prognosis, and sensitive and specific assays have been developed for its measurement. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the administration of ProCT to septic animals greatly increases mortality, and several toxic effects of ProCT have been elucidated by in vitro experimental studies. Antibodies have been developed that neutralize the harmful effects of ProCT, and their use markedly decreases the symptomatology and mortality of animals that harbour a highly virulent sepsis analogous to that occurring in humans. This therapy is facilitated by the long duration of serum ProCT elevation, which allows for a broad window of therapeutic opportunity. An experimental groundwork has been established that suggests a potential applicability of such therapy in septic humans."
15635958,Blood invasiveness of Salmonella enterica as a function of age and serotype.,2004,"We explored the dual influence of the patient's age and the infecting serotype on the blood invasiveness patterns of non-Typhi Salmonella enterica (NTS). Blood invasiveness ratio (BIR) was calculated as the ratio between the number of blood and blood + stool isolates. Analysis of 14,951 NTS isolates showed that the BIR increased drastically above the age of 60 years, reaching levels 3.5-7 times higher compared to age group < 2 years. Different patterns of age-related invasiveness were observed for the five most common NTS serotypes (Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Virchow, Hadar, Infantis). Among children < 2 years, the BIR was highest for serotype Virchow and lowest for serotype Hadar, while in persons > or = 60 years it was highest for serotypes Enteritidis and lowest for serotype Infantis. The tendency of NTS serotypes to invade the bloodstream was significantly influenced by the patient's age, however the impact of age differed for various NTS serotypes."
41404203,Sepsis-Induced Myocardial Dysfunction and Its Prognostic Implications for Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of morbidity in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, yet its direct impact on mortality remains uncertain. This systematic review synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the association between SIMD and outcomes in septic patients. Echocardiographic and biomarker-based assessments consistently demonstrated that SIMD is a frequent and often reversible complication of sepsis, associated with greater disease severity and impaired hemodynamics. Pharmacological interventions such as levosimendan and Xinmailong infusion were found to improve surrogate measures of cardiac function, yet none conferred a significant survival benefit at 28 days. While advanced imaging modalities like speckle-tracking echocardiography enhanced diagnostic sensitivity, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and outcome definitions limited the strength of pooled conclusions. Overall, SIMD appears to be a clinically relevant marker of illness severity, but current evidence does not establish it as an independent predictor of mortality. Larger multicenter trials with standardized diagnostic frameworks and long-term follow-up are required to clarify its prognostic role and to determine whether targeted therapies can alter patient outcomes."
41451718,Duodenojejunostomy versus Duodenoduodenostomy in Congenital Duodenal Obstruction: A retrospective study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital duodenal obstruction (CDO) is a common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction, most requiring surgery to restore bowel continuity. Duodenoduodenostomy (DD) is the preferred procedure, but duodenojejunostomy (DJ) may be performed when DD is not feasible due to anatomy, particularly in small or premature infants. In our centre, choice of procedure was based on intraoperative findings, tension-free anastomosis feasibility, and surgeon preference. This study compared short-term outcomes of DJ and DD in CDO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a cross-sectional about outcome of congenital duodenal obstruction at Hasan Sadikin Bandung General Hospital in 2019-2024. Data were collected through medical records, including gestational age, age at surgery, surgical technique, operation time, time to first feed, time to full feed, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: There were a total of 36 congenital duodenal obstruction patients. There were 4 patients (11%) who died before surgery, and 32 patients (89%) underwent surgery. All procedures were performed open surgery. Duodenojejunostomy was performed in 10 patients (31%), duodenoduodenostomy in 22 patients (69%). Time to first feed (mean) is post operative day 8 vs 9 (P = 0.3), time to full feed (mean) post operative day 27.1 vs 25.4 (p=0.8) and length of stay (mean) 27.6 days vs 34.6 days (p=0.9). Three patient of each group died post operative due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Duodenojejunostomy and duodenoduodenostomy have similar outcomes in neonates with congenital duodenal obstruction. These findings are relevant for surgeons who repair congenital duodenal obstruction with duodenojejunostomy or duodenoduodenostomy in open surgery."
41483663,Clinical and molecular characterization of a fulminant meningococcemia case in an adult caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y clonal complex 23 strain in China.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (NmY), first reported in China in 2015, remains rare, with only a few cases reported to date. Previously documented NmY invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases in China predominantly occurred among adolescents or children. This study reports the first confirmed adult IMD case caused by NmY in China. METHODS: A 22-year-old male in Guangdong Province presented with IMD symptoms. The causative agent (NmY20231109) was isolated from blood culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted for molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis against global NmY strains. RESULTS: The isolate (NmY20231109) was susceptible to most tested antibiotics but resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. WGS identified the strain as Y: P1.5-1,10-1: F4-1: ST-1655 (CC23). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NmY20231109 clustered closely with ST-1655 strains from the UK and Germany. It showed genetic distance from the four ST-1655 strains previously reported in China. Virulence gene profiling identified 52 associated genes, including key factors such as fHbp and porB. CONCLUSION: This report describes the first adult IMD case caused by NmY in China. The identification of NmY20231109 as ST-1655 (CC23), closely related to European strains, suggests a potential imported origin and highlights the ongoing risk of NmY transmission in China."
41527652,A Rare Case of Streptococcus equi Infection: A Report and Brief Review of the Literature.,2025,"We present a rare case of Streptococcus (S.) equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ) bacteremia in a 73-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, pulmonary embolism, and recent left knee total arthroplasty who developed fever and sepsis complicated by septic arthritis of a prosthetic knee and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood cultures grew S. equi in four out of four bottles, and history revealed frequent horse exposure, suggesting zoonotic transmission with hematogenous seeding of the prosthetic joint. The diagnosis was further challenged by systemic computed tomography (CT) abnormalities and the concurrent DVT, which initially obscured the infectious source. The patient was treated with three days of piperacillin-tazobactam before de-escalation to intravenous ceftriaxone for six weeks, followed by 6 months of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, which was then extended for an additional 12 months based on clinical response. SEZ causing prosthetic joint infection is exceptionally rare, and this case underscores the importance of recognizing zoonotic pathogens as potential causes of hematogenous prosthetic joint infections, particularly in immunocompromised hosts."
31896062,Effect of citrulline on muscle protein turnover in an in vitro model of muscle catabolism.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Muscle net catabolism, as seen after severe trauma or sepsis or in postoperative situations, is mediated by hormones (e.g., cortisol) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]). Specific amino acids may be able to limit this muscle mass loss. Citrulline (CIT) stimulates muscle protein synthesis in various situations, but little data exist on hypercatabolic situations and the effects on protein breakdown are unknown. Our aim was to assess the effect of CIT on protein turnover in an in vitro model of muscle hypercatabolism. METHODS: Myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts were treated with 150 nM dexamethasone (DEX), 10 ng/mL TNF-alpha, or 0.006% ethanol (as control [CON]) for 24 h. Subsequently, myotubes were incubated with or without 5 mM CIT for 6 h. Muscle protein synthesis rate was evaluated by the surface sensing of translation method and by l-[3,5-(3)H]tyrosine (Tyr) incorporation. The muscle protein breakdown rate was evaluated from Tyr release into culture medium. CIT action was analyzed by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: CIT treatment significantly increased protein synthesis rates compared with the DEX or TNF-alpha group (surface sensing of translation method; DEX + CIT versus DEX; P = 0.03 and TNF-alpha+CIT versus TNF-alpha; P = 0.05) and significantly decreased protein breakdown rate in the CON and DEX groups (CON + CIT versus CON; P = 0.05 and DEX + CIT versus DEX; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CIT treatment regulated muscle protein turnover in an in vitro model of muscle net catabolism. Exploring the underlying mechanisms would also be of interest."
41413552,Asymptomatic parasitaemia in a malaria pre-elimination setting in the Putumayo area of the Ecuadorian Amazon basin.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Ecuador is approaching malaria elimination, but its Amazonian Putumayo canton borders regions in Colombia and Peru with high transmission intensity. This 'frontier' setting represents a critical vulnerability where asymptomatic infections may sustain transmission, undetected by routine surveillance. METHODS: In a repeated cross-sectional study during the 2023 rainy season, we surveyed 293 asymptomatic individuals in four riverine communities in Putumayo. We used a tiered diagnostic approach: rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), expert microscopy, and real-time qPCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene. RESULTS: No infections were detected by RDT (0/293). Microscopy identified three P. vivax infections (1.0%, 95% CI 0.2-2.4%). qPCR detected five positive cases (1.7%, 95% CI 0.6-3.9%), revealing two additional submicroscopic infections. The failure of a subsequent species-specific PCR and high Cq values (mean 32.6) indicated very low parasite densities. Infections were found only in the mid-to-late rainy season, predominantly in males. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular surveillance revealed a low-density, asymptomatic malaria reservoir missed entirely by RDTs, and partially by microscopy. This hidden burden represents a critical blind spot for Ecuador's elimination program. To achieve and sustain elimination, surveillance in such border regions must incorporate highly sensitive molecular tools and be supported by robust cross-border collaboration."
15679634,Schistosomiasis co-infection in humans influences inflammatory markers in uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,2004,"Malaria and schistosomiasis are the two major parasite diseases present in developing countries. The epidemiological co-infection with schistosomiasis could influence the development of the physiological reaction associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection in human. Most studies have demonstrated the association of circulating levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) and soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors (sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII) with the morbidity of malaria. In the present study, we showed that Schistosoma haematobium co-infection influences, in an age-dependent manner, the unbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory circulating cytokines that play a key role during malaria infection. Indeed, children co-infected by S. haematobium have higher levels of IFN-gamma and sTNF-RII than children infected only by P. falciparum. In contrast, co-infected adults presented a significant increase of IFN-gamma, IL-10, TGF-beta, sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII rates and IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio. Taken together, this study indicates that schistosomiasis co-infection can unbalance the regulation of inflammatory factors in uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The possible consequences of the schistosomiasis co-infection for age-dependent malaria morbidity are discussed."
25498529,Clinical features and impact of empirical therapy in cirrhotic adults with community-onset bacteremia.,2015,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the clinical characteristics of community-onset bacteremia in cirrhotic adults visiting the emergency department (ED), as well as the clinical impact of empirical antibiotics on their outcome. METHODS: Cirrhotic adults with community-onset bacteremia who visited the ED from January 2005 to December 2009 were included retrospectively. Clinical data and outcome were collected from the medical chart. The in vitro susceptibility was measured by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Of the 246 bacteremic episodes in cirrhotic patients, the major sources of bacteremia included intraabdominal infections (111, 45.1%), primary bacteremia (43, 17.5%), urinary tract infection (39, 15.9%), and soft tissue infection (22, 8.9%). Of the 258 bacteremic pathogens identified, Escherichia coli (83 isolates, 33.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (61, 23.6%) were the most common microorganisms. In the multivariate analysis, delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy (>72 hours; odds ratio [OR], 4.29; P=.003), serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL at the ED (OR, 3.12; P=.005), severe sepsis (OR, 3.61; P=.01), Pittsburgh bacteremia score of at least 4 (OR, 2.66; P=.04), bacteremia due to pneumonia (OR, 5.44; P=.02), and a comorbidity of diabetes mellitus (OR, 3.54; P=.004) were independently associated with the 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on cirrhotic adults with community-onset bacteremia, we emphasized that the cirrhosis severity is one of the critical factors when choosing empirical antimicrobial therapy and that the strategy of empirical therapy is warranted for cirrhotic adults with severe decompensation (Child's C group). For critically ill patients, especially in those with Child's C group, only piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, or imipenem treatment was warranted because of susceptibility rate of greater than 90%."
15614260,A history of neonatal group B streptococcus with its related morbidity and mortality rates in the United States.,2004,"The history of neonatal sepsis related to early onset group B streptococcus (GBS) emerged in the early 1970s. The neonatal mortality rate was 55% for those neonates with invasive GBS disease. The first adopted guidelines by the medical community to prevent early onset GBS were developed in the 1990s. One year after implementation of the guidelines, the mortality rate dropped to approximately 5%. Despite the great accomplishments in reducing the mortality rate, GBS remains the number one cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the United States."
26266907,Uncontrolled sepsis: a systematic review of translational immunology studies in intensive care medicine.,2014,"BACKGROUND: The design of clinical immunology studies in sepsis presents several fundamental challenges to improving the translational understanding of pathologic mechanisms. We undertook a systematic review of bed-to-benchside studies to test the hypothesis that variable clinical design methodologies used to investigate immunologic function in sepsis contribute to apparently conflicting laboratory data, and identify potential alternatives that overcome various obstacles to improve experimental design. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the design methodology employed to study neutrophil function (respiratory burst), monocyte endotoxin tolerance and lymphocyte apoptosis in the intensive care setting, over the past 15 years. We specifically focussed on how control samples were defined, taking into account age, gender, ethnicity, concomitant therapies, timing of sample collection and the criteria used to diagnose sepsis. RESULTS: We identified 57 eligible studies, the majority of which (74%) used case-control methodology. Healthy volunteers represented the control population selected in 83% of studies. Comprehensive demographic data on age, gender and ethnicity were provided in </=48% of case control studies. Documentation of diseases associated with immunosuppression, malignancy and immunomodulatory therapies was rare. Less than half (44%) of studies undertook independent adjudication for the diagnosis of sepsis while 68% provided microbiological data. The timing of sample collection was defined by highly variable clinical criteria. By contrast, surgical studies avoided many such confounders, although only one study in surgical patients monitored the study group for development of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: We found several important and common limitations in the clinical design of translational immunologic studies in human sepsis. Major elective surgery overcame many of these methodological limitations. The failure of adequate clinical design in mechanistic studies may contribute to the lack of translational therapeutic progress in intensive care medicine."
41474875,Infective Endocarditis: Severe Complication from a Common Procedure.,2025,"We describe an Army Officer with infectious endocarditis af-ter being hospitalized with a heat injury while participating in Special Forces Assessment and Selection. A 26-year-old other-wise healthy male presented with a fever, skin lesions, and pain at his IV site after a recent hospitalization. He was admitted on intravenous antibiotics due to suspicion of bacteremia and was eventually diagnosed with MRSA endocarditis. The pa-tient required months of antibiotics and left brachial vein exci-sion for source control. After multiple readmissions for MRSA bacteremia over the following 2 years, the patient was placed on daily prophylactic doxycycline. Due to complications from his condition, the patient was medically retired from the Army. When the tactical setting allows, prehospital providers must practice aseptic techniques and advocate for their patients when other providers lack awareness of the impact of field environments."
41477440,Congenital Tuberculous Lymphadenitis in a Preterm Neonate Born to a Comatose Mother in a High TB-Burden Setting: A Case Report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Congenital tuberculosis (TB) is a rare but often fatal condition, particularly in preterm neonates within high-burden regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Diagnosis is complicated by nonspecific symptoms and resource limitations, with maternal critical illness further delaying detection and increasing vertical transmission risk. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report details a preterm male infant (30 weeks' gestation) born vaginally to an HIV-negative mother who experienced a 2-month coma during pregnancy in the DRC. The neonate presented at 3 weeks with cervical lymphadenopathy, respiratory distress, and failure to thrive. Initial sepsis treatment with antibiotics failed. Postpartum maternal sputum testing confirmed pulmonary TB. Neonatal lymph node biopsy revealed caseating granulomas, and GeneXpert MTB/RIF confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The infant received weight-adjusted antitubercular therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide), leading to progressive clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: This case underscores congenital TB as a critical differential diagnosis in preterm infants with lymphadenopathy born to critically ill mothers in TB-endemic areas. Maternal coma-a likely indicator of disseminated TB-masked symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and amplified transmission risk. The report advocates for integrating routine TB screening into antenatal care protocols for all critically ill pregnant women in high-burden settings, irrespective of overt respiratory symptoms. Early maternal diagnosis and prompt neonatal treatment are essential to reduce mortality in this vulnerable population. Enhanced screening in high-risk pregnancies represents an urgent public health priority for mitigating vertical TB transmission in resource-limited contexts."
25672600,Point-of-care testing in the overcrowded emergency department--can it make a difference?,2014,"Emergency departments (EDs) face several challenges in maintaining consistent quality care in the face of steadily increasing public demand. Improvements in the survival rate of critically ill patients in the ED are directly related to the advancement of early recognition and treatment. Frequent episodes of overcrowding and prolonged waiting times force EDs to operate beyond their capacity and threaten to impact upon patient care. The objectives of this review are as follows: (a) to establish overcrowding as a threat to patient outcomes, person-centered care, and public safety in the ED; (b) to describe scenarios in which point-of-care testing (POCT) has been found to ameliorate factors thought to contribute to overcrowding; and (c) to discuss how POCT can be used directly, and indirectly, to expedite patient care and improve outcomes. Various studies have shown that overcrowding in the ED has profound effects on operational efficiency and patient care. Several reports have quantified overcrowding in the ED and have described a relationship between heightened periods of overcrowding and delays in treatment, increased incidence of adverse events, and an even greater probability of mortality. In certain scenarios, POCT has been found to increase the number of patients discharged in a timely manner, expedite triage of urgent but non-emergency patients, and decrease delays to treatment initiation. This review concludes that POCT, when used effectively, may alleviate the negative impacts of overcrowding on the safety, effectiveness, and person-centeredness of care in the ED."
25542696,Tolerability of induction chemotherapy dosing practices in acute myeloid leukemia patients.,2015,"For patients with high body surface areas (BSA), differing chemotherapy dosing strategies have been utilized in attempts to reduce toxicity. In a retrospective evaluation, we compared the effects of chemotherapy dosing in acute myeloid leukemia patients with high BSA (>2m(2)) who received capped doses (n=12) to those who received uncapped doses (n=24), and to patients with BSA</=2m(2) (n=42). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (BSA</=2m(2), BSA>2m(2) capped, and BSA>2m(2) uncapped) in the incidences of febrile neutropenia (85.7, 66.7, and 75.0%, respectively, p=0.29), bacteremia (19.0, 8.3, and 16.7%, respectively, p=0.68), mucositis (42.8, 50.0, and 41.7%, respectively, p=0.88) or nausea/vomiting (47.6, 33.3, and 37.5, respectively, p=0.57). Results suggest delivery of unadjusted chemotherapy based on actual body weight is likely safe in hematological malignancies."
15648239,Laparoscopic repair of perforated duodenal ulcer.,2004,"Laparoscopic closure of an acutely perforated duodenal ulcer is an alternative procedure to open surgery. With proper training and experience this procedure might overtake laparotomy and simple closure thereby reducing the post operative morbidity in terms of reduced wound pain, short hospital stay, likely reduced wound sepsis and hernia occurrence and post operative chest complications. We report a 63-year old man with acute perforation of duodenal ulcer who were submitted to an emergency laparoscopic repair, first time done on the Department of Surgery, Univerisity Clinical Center of Tuzla."
19949078,Inhibitory TCR coreceptor PD-1 is a sensitive indicator of low-level replication of SIV and HIV-1.,2010,"Ongoing antigenic stimulation appears to be an important prerequisite for the persistent expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory TCR coreceptor of the CD28 family. Although recent publications have emphasized the utility of PD-1 as a marker for dysfunctional T cells in chronic viral infections, its dependence on antigenic stimulation potentially renders it a sensitive indicator of low-level viral replication. To explore the antigenic threshold for the maintenance of PD-1 expression on virus-specific T cells, we compared PD-1 expression on virus-specific and memory T cell populations in controlled and uncontrolled SIV and HIV-1 infection. In both controlled live attenuated SIV infection in rhesus macaques and HIV-1 infection in elite controllers, elevated levels of PD-1 expression were observed on SIV- and HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells. However, in contrast to chronic wild-type SIV infection and uncontrolled HIV-1 infection, controlled SIV/HIV-1 infection did not result in increased expression of PD-1 on total memory T cells. PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells rapidly decreased after the emergence of CTL escape in cognate epitopes, but was maintained in the setting of low or undetectable levels of plasma viremia in live attenuated SIV-infected macaques. After inoculation of naive macaques with a single-cycle SIV, PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells initially increased, but was rapidly downregulated. These results demonstrate that PD-1 can serve as a sensitive indicator of persistent, low-level virus replication and that generalized PD-1 expression on T lymphocytes is a distinguishing characteristic of uncontrolled lentiviral infections."
20003199,"Multiplex real-time quantitative PCR, microscopy and rapid diagnostic immuno-chromatographic tests for the detection of Plasmodium spp: performance, limit of detection analysis and quality assurance.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Accurate laboratory diagnosis of malaria species in returning travelers is paramount in the treatment of this potentially fatal infectious disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 466 blood specimens from returning travelers to Africa, Asia, and South/Central America with suspected malaria infection were collected between 2007 and 2009 at the reference public health laboratory. These specimens were assessed by reference microscopy, multipex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), and two rapid diagnostic immuno-chromatographic tests (ICT) in a blinded manner. Key clinical laboratory parameters such as limit of detection (LOD) analysis on clinical specimens by parasite stage, inter-reader variability of ICTs, staffing implications, quality assurance and cost analysis were evaluated. RESULTS: QPCR is the most analytically sensitive method (sensitivity 99.41%), followed by CARESTART (sensitivity 88.24%), and BINAXNOW (sensitivity 86.47%) for the diagnosis of malaria in returning travelers when compared to reference microscopy. However, microscopy was unable to specifically identify Plasmodia spp. in 18 out of 170 positive samples by QPCR. Moreover, the 17 samples that were negative by microscopy and positive by QPCR were also positive by ICTs. Quality assurance was achieved for QPCR by exchanging a blinded proficiency panel with another reference laboratory. The Kappa value of inter-reader variability among three readers for BINAXNOW and CARESTART was calculated to be 0.872 and 0.898 respectively. Serial dilution studies demonstrated that the QPCR cycle threshold correlates linearly with parasitemia (R(2) = 0.9746) in a clinically relevant dynamic range and retains a LOD of 11 rDNA copies/microl for P. falciparum, which was several log lower than reference microscopy and ICTs. LOD for QPCR is affected not only by parasitemia but the parasite stage distribution of each clinical specimen. QPCR was approximately 6-fold more costly than reference microscopy. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that multiplex QPCR although more costly confers a significant diagnostic advantage in terms of LOD compared to reference microscopy and ICTs for all four species. Quality assurance of QPCR is essential to the maintenance of proficiency in the clinical laboratory. ICTs showed good concordance between readers however lacked sensitivity for non-falciparum species due to antigenic differences and low parasitemia. CONCLUSION: Multiplex QPCR but not ICTs is an essential adjunct to microscopy in the reference laboratory detection of malaria species specifically due to the superior LOD. ICTs are better suited to the non-reference laboratory where lower specimen volumes challenge microscopy proficiency in the non-endemic setting."
32308821,Serial Heart Rate Variability Measures for Risk Prediction of Septic Patients in the Emergency Department.,2019,"In this study, we used serial heart rate variability (HRV) measures over 2 hours to improve the prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality among septic patients in the emergency department (ED). We presented a generalizable methodology for processing and analysing HRV time series (HRVTS) data which may be noisy and incomplete. Feature sets were created from the HRVTS data of 162 patients with suspected sepsis using aggregation-based, deltabased and regression-based series-to-point transformations, and modelled over 100 random stratified splits. An optimized feature set comprising 12 selected HRVTS features performed better than baseline feature sets which only included patient demographics, vital signs and single time-point HRV measures taken at triage. This improved risk stratification approach could be used in the ED to identify high-risk septic patients for appropriate management and disposition."
20182676,Early-onset septicemia due to CMY-2-producing Escherichia coli in a woman with blunt abdominal trauma.,2009,Escherichia coli remains one of the most common etiologies of secondary peritonitis. CMY-2 is the most prevalent AmpC enzyme identified in nosocomial E. coli isolates causing bacteremia in Taiwan. This report is of a patient who underwent surgery for intestinal perforations due to blunt abdominal trauma and developed unexpected CMY-2-producing E. coli septicemia in the early postoperative period. The AmpC-type CMY-2 enzyme might partially contribute to the poor response to antimicrobial therapy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or flomoxef. Late changes in antibiotic therapy to an appropriate regimen of cefpirome based on the culture results did not result in a positive outcome and the patient died. Whether selection of an anti-AmpC regimen is appropriate as first-line treatment for traumatic abdomen-associated septicemia should be an area of further investigation in Taiwan.
20345005,A pilot study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of local terminology for malaria screening among children in rural Malawi.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a serious health problem in Malawi. It is responsible for 43% of all out patient visits and 19% of all deaths occurring to children under five years of age. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment can avert most malaria deaths. However this is not always possible in resource limited settings where functioning laboratories are almost nonexistent. METHODS: This paper assesses the accuracy of local terminology in detecting parasitemia in children using blood smears as the reference standard. RESULTS: The study observes that there are local terms that can be used as an inexpensive, readily available and easily implementable malaria screening test in Malawian children in rural areas. These terms include ""malungo"" (official name for malaria), ""kutentha thupi"" (hot body), ""kutsegula m'mimba"" (official term for diarrhoea) and ""kukhosomola"" (coughing). The local terms ""malungo"" and ""kutentha thupi"" yielded better results. CONCLUSION: Although the local terminology produced results that are less than optimal, the study concludes that the knowledge of sensitivity and specificity of local terminology can be used by local healthcare practitioners to identify children who could benefit from malaria confirmation testing and presumptive treatment. The study, however, cautions that these terms should be used as an entry point to malaria case management as they do not distinguish the severity of the malaria infection and all of them produced a sensitivity of less than 50%."
15585833,Cutting edge: expression patterns of surface and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in human endotoxemia.,2004,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a recently identified molecule involved in the amplification of inflammation. To determine the regulation of TREM-1, we studied TREM-1 expression and soluble TREM-1 plasma levels upon i.v. LPS challenge in healthy humans in vivo and in vitro. Granulocyte TREM-1 expression was high at baseline and immediately down-regulated upon LPS exposure along with an increase in soluble TREM-1. Monocytes displayed a gradual up-regulation of TREM-1 upon LPS in vivo and in vitro. In vitro studies extended these findings to highly purified lipoteichoic acid and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nonbacterial TLR ligands such as polyinosine-polycytidylic acid and imidazoquinoline, as well as the TLR9 ligand CpG, did not impact TREM-1 expression. The LPS-induced alterations in TREM-1 surface expression were not a result of increased TNF-alpha or IL-10. Inhibitor studies disclosed a PI3K-dependent pathway in LPS-induced up-regulation of TREM-1 on monocytes, whereas MAPK played a limited role."
41420075,Proteinase 3 is involved in presepsin production through neutrophil extracellular trap phagocytosis by macrophages.,2025,"Presepsin (P-SEP), a soluble subtype of CD14, is widely recognized as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its production remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether M1 macrophages (M1 MPhis) contribute to P-SEP generation by phagocytosing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and degrading NET-derived CD14 through intracellular proteinase 3 (PR3). M1 MPhis were differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors, and NETs were induced in neutrophils stimulated with Escherichia coli or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA. Co-cultures of M1 MPhis and NETs were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blotting. The effects of PR3 inhibition (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or elafin) and phagocytosis inhibition (cytochalasin D or wortmannin) on P-SEP production were also evaluated. Recombinant CD14 (rCD14) was used in an in vitro cleavage assay to confirm PR3-dependent CD14 fragmentation. M1 MPhis actively phagocytosed citrullinated histone H3-positive NETs and produced intracellular P-SEP. P-SEP levels strongly correlated with the percentage of NETs (r = 0.907). Inhibition of PR3 activity or phagocytosis significantly reduced P-SEP production. Furthermore, incubation of rCD14 with PR3 produced P-SEP, and this effect was blocked by PR3 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate that PR3 contributes to P-SEP production through CD14 cleavage following NET phagocytosis by M1 MPhis. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the P-SEP biogenesis and advances the understanding of its role as a biomarker in sepsis.

20338585,Effects of combination dobutamine and vasopressin therapy on microcirculatory blood flow in a porcine model of severe endotoxic shock.,2011,"BACKGROUND: Dobutamine (DB) has been recommended in combination with vasopressor therapy in septic shock, given its reported ability to improve mesenteric and microcirculatory perfusion. Vasopressin (VP) is typically reserved as a second-line agent due to the concern of ischemia. The purpose of our study was to determine whether combination DB and VP therapy improved microcirculatory blood flow in severe endotoxic shock. METHODS: Septic shock was induced in 20 anesthetized piglets with injection of E. coli endotoxin. DB (10 mug/kg/min, n = 5) and VP (0.04 units/min, n = 10) were administered alone and in combination (n = 15). Measurements were compared at baseline, following endotoxin administration, and following treatment. Microcirculatory blood flow was determined via the injection of colored microspheres. RESULTS: VP completely reversed endotoxin-mediated hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 85 +/- 4.5 mm Hg, which was not significantly altered with the addition of DB (77 +/- 4.9 mm Hg). Endotoxin uniformly depressed cardiac output (CO) from baseline (227 +/- 10.7 versus 174 +/- 12.4 mL/min/kg) despite treatment with VP alone or in combination with DB. The addition of DB did not improve the CO in this severe septic shock model. VP was found to shunt microcirculatory flow from the skin and GI tract to vital organs such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, which was not altered with the addition of DB. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that DB is ineffective in increasing CO or improving mesenteric blood flow when used with physiologic replacement doses of VP. In combination, DB is unable to overcome the blood flow distribution achieved with VP administration alone in severe endotoxic shock."
20440448,Empyema necessitans and acute osteomyelitis associated with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in an infant.,2009,"Staphylococcus aureus is a well recognized pathogen with global distribution. In recent years community-associated, methicillin-resistant S. aureus has emerged as an increasing cause of severe infections among adults and children. Herein, a case is reported of a previously healthy, 19-month-old male, who presented with empyema necessitans and acute osteomyelitis due to a community-associated, methicillin-resistant, S. aureus strain. This report highlights the evolving epidemiology of S. aureus, as important pathogen in the community as well as the hospital setting, and the importance of establishing appropriate guidelines for diagnosis, management and surveillance of this public health problem."
20120380,[The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of malaria under the present conditions of Tajikistan].,2009,"The highest malaria morbidity rates have been observed in the Tajikistan's Khatlon Region that is contiguous with Afghanistan. This area is notorious for its high malariogenicity (""susceptibility"" according to the WHO terminology), caused by natural climatic factors, as well as a significant vulnerability associated with socioeconomic conditions (intensive migration of populations among which there are many infected subjects). In children, tropical malaria is generally characterized by an acute onset, abnormal fever, and its polymorphism of clinical manifestations that are exemplified by the lack of typical malaria paroxysms, as well as a gradual progression of parasitemia during the first malaria attacks. Recurrences are induced by ineffective treatment and chloroquine resistance in the tropical malaria pathogen. The reduction in malaria morbidity has resulted from a package of large-scale malaria-controlling measures implemented with the support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria."
31870283,Rapid classification of group B Streptococcus serotypes based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and machine learning techniques.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Group B streptococcus (GBS) is an important pathogen that is responsible for invasive infections, including sepsis and meningitis. GBS serotyping is an essential means for the investigation of possible infection outbreaks and can identify possible sources of infection. Although it is possible to determine GBS serotypes by either immuno-serotyping or geno-serotyping, both traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been reported as an effective tool for the determination of GBS serotypes in a more rapid and accurate manner. Thus, this work aims to investigate GBS serotypes by incorporating machine learning techniques with MALDI-TOF MS to carry out the identification. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 787 GBS isolates, obtained from three research and teaching hospitals, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the serotype of the GBS was determined by a geno-serotyping experiment. The peaks of mass-to-charge ratios were regarded as the attributes to characterize the various serotypes of GBS. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were then used to construct predictive models for the five different serotypes (Types Ia, Ib, III, V, and VI). After optimization of feature selection and model generation based on training datasets, the accuracies of the selected models attained 54.9-87.1% for various serotypes based on independent testing data. Specifically, for the major serotypes, namely type III and type VI, the accuracies were 73.9 and 70.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed models have been adopted to implement a web-based tool (GBSTyper), which is now freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/GBSTyper/, for providing efficient and effective detection of GBS serotypes based on a MALDI-TOF MS spectrum. Overall, this work has demonstrated that the combination of MALDI-TOF MS and machine intelligence could provide a practical means of clinical pathogen testing."
31888895,STEMI: rare initial presentation of a mediastinal mass supplied by the RCA.,2019,"In the setting of severe septic shock, a 70-year-old woman had an ST segment myocardial infarction with ST elevations in the inferolateral leads. On cardiac catheterisation, no obstructive pathology was noted. Chest imaging revealed a large mediastinal mass measuring 8.5x6.5x7.5 cm in the visceral compartment of the mediastinum, with contrast enhancement from the right coronary artery (RCA). A biopsy was preformed and cytology was consistent with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm. On review of the cardiac catherisation, it was noted that the mass was deriving blood supply from the RCA. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a rare but well-documented phenomenon. In this case, MINOCA was caused by coronary steal syndrome in the setting of profound hypotension. Immediate management is with haemodynamic support; there is no role for coronary intervention."
15597794,[Rapid measurement system of humoral mediator].,2004,"It is well known that various kinds of humoral mediators are discovered by the progress of a molecule biological method in recent years, and those humoral mediators that was produced excessively play an important role in the pathogenesis of SIRS and sepsis. However, it is impossible to measure those humoral mediators quickly in a present stage. The establishment of the fast measurement method of humoral mediators is indispensable for the judgment of septic conditions that change day by day. In this manuscript, we discussed that the role of humoral mediators in the SIRS and septic conditions and the clinical significance of established method for rapid measurement of humoral mediators."
15589360,[An unusual aetiology for septic shock: Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Is always dog man's best friend?].,2004,"The mortality of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections (OPSI) is significant (50 to 80 percent). Capnocytophaga canimorsus belongs to the normal oral flora of dogs and cats. It is seldom responsible for human infections, but its prognosis is bad (about 30 percent of overall mortality), especially in asplenic patients. We report a case of a splenectomized patient who suffered from communal septic shock due to C. canimorsus septicaemia. The course of events was rapidly fatal. Diagnosis and mode of contamination were determined only a few weeks after the patient's death. This late microbiological diagnosis is due to a slow growth of C. canimorsus in vitro."
19951390,Is thenar tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation in septic shock related to macrohemodynamic variables and outcome?,2009,"INTRODUCTION: The study objectives were to evaluate septic shock-induced alterations in skeletal muscle hemoglobin oxygenation saturation (StO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and forearm skin blood flow velocity using laser Doppler (LD) to determine the relationship of macroperfusion and microperfusion parameters, and to test the relationship of the worst NIRS parameters during the first 24 hours of shock with 28-day prognosis. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was performed in a 21-bed university hospital surgical intensive care unit. Forty-three septic shock patients with at least another organ failure underwent a 3-minute, upper arm (brachial artery) vascular occlusion test (VOT). Microperfusion parameters (thenar eminence StO2 and forearm LD skin blood flow) were collected on days 1, 2 and 3, before (baseline StO2 and LD values) and during the 3-minute VOT with calculation of occlusion and reperfusion slopes for StO2 and LD. Daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, macrohemodynamic parameters (systolic arterial blood pressure, cardiac output (pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal Doppler), mixed venous oxygen saturation (pulmonary artery or superior vena cava catheter)) and metabolic parameters (pH, base excess, lactate) were determined. RESULTS: Baseline StO2 (82% (75 to 88) vs. 89% (85 to 92), P = 0.04) and reperfusion slope (2.79%/second (1.75 to 4.32) vs. 9.35%/second (8.32 to 11.57), P < 0.0001) were lower in septic shock patients than in healthy volunteers. StO2 reperfusion slope correlated with occlusion slope (P < 0.0001), cardiac output (P = 0.01) and LD reperfusion slope (P = 0.08), and negatively with lactate level (P = 0.04). The worst StO2 reperfusion slope during the first day of shock was lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (P = 0.003) and improved significantly the predictive value of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and SOFA scores. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration of StO2 reperfusion slope in septic shock patients compared with healthy volunteers was related with macrohemodynamic, microhemodynamic and metabolic parameters. The addition of the worst value of the day 1 StO2 reperfusion slope improved the outcome prediction of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and SOFA scores."
26582869,"Quantifying the Burden of Hospital-Acquired Bloodstream Infection in Children in England by Estimating Excess Length of Hospital Stay and Mortality Using a Multistate Analysis of Linked, Routinely Collected Data.",2015,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (HA-BSI) is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in all patient populations. Young children have been shown to have a high rate of healthcare-associated infections compared with the adult population. We aimed to quantify the excess mortality and length of stay in pediatric patients from HA-BSI. METHODS: We analyzed data collected retrospectively from a probabilistically linked national database of pediatric (aged 1 month-18 years) in-patients with a microbiologically confirmed HA-BSI in England between January and March 2009. A time-dependent Cox regression model was fit to determine the presence of any effect. Furthermore, a multistate model, adjusted for the time to onset of HA-BSI, was used to compare outcomes in patients with HA-BSI to those without HA-BSI. We further adjusted for patients' characteristics as recorded in hospital admission data. RESULTS: The dataset comprised 333 605 patients, with 214 cases of HA-BSI. After adjustment for time to HA-BSI and comorbidities, the hazard for discharge (dead or alive) from hospital for patients with HA-BSI was 0.9 times (95% confidence interval [CI], .8-1.1) that of noninfected patients. Excess length of stay associated with all-cause HA-BSI was 1.6 days (95% CI, .2-3.0), although this duration varied by pathogen. Patients with HA-BSI had a 3.6 (95% CI, 1.3-10.4) times higher hazard for in-hospital death than noninfected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired bloodstream infection increased the length of stay and mortality of pediatric inpatients. The results of this study provide an evidence base to judge the health and economic impact of programs to prevent and control HA-BSI in children."
15630469,"Randomized, controlled trial of therapy interruption in chronic HIV-1 infection.",2004,"BACKGROUND: Approaches to limiting exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs are an active area of HIV therapy research. Here we present longitudinal follow-up of a randomized, open-label, single-center study of the immune, viral, and safety outcomes of structured therapy interruptions (TIs) in patients with chronically suppressed HIV-1 infection as compared to equal follow-up of patients on continuous therapy and including a final therapy interruption in both arms. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Forty-two chronically HIV-infected patients on suppressive ART with CD4 counts higher than 400 were randomized 1:1 to either (1) three successive fixed TIs of 2, 4, and 6 wk, with intervening resumption of therapy with resuppression for 4 wk before subsequent interruption, or (2) 40 wk of continuous therapy, with a final open-ended TI in both treatment groups. Main outcome was analysis of the time to viral rebound (>5,000 copies/ml) during the open-ended TI. Secondary outcomes included study-defined safety criteria, viral resistance, therapy failure, and retention of immune reconstitution. There was no difference between the groups in time to viral rebound during the open-ended TI (continuous therapy/single TI, median [interquartile range] = 4 [1-8] wk, n = 21; repeated TI, median [interquartile range] = 5 [4-8] wk, n = 21; p = 0.36). No differences in study-related adverse events, viral set point at 12 or 20 wk of open-ended interruption, viral resistance or therapy failure, retention of CD4 T cell numbers on ART, or retention of lymphoproliferative recall antigen responses were noted between groups. Importantly, resistance detected shortly after initial viremia following the open-ended TI did not result in a lack of resuppression to less than 50 copies/ml after reinitiation of the same drug regimen. CONCLUSION: Cycles of 2- to 6-wk time-fixed TIs in patients with suppressed HIV infection failed to confer a clinically significant benefit with regard to viral suppression off ART. Also, secondary analysis showed no difference between the two strategies in terms of safety, retention of immune reconstitution, and clinical therapy failure. Based on these findings, we suggest that further clinical research on the long-term consequences of TI strategies to decrease drug exposure is warranted."
31908991,Pilot study of a novel serum mRNA gene panel for diagnosis of acute septic arthritis.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency requiring immediate surgical intervention. Current diagnostic standard of care is an invasive joint aspiration. Aspirations provide information about the inflammatory cells in the sample within a few hours, but there is often ambiguity about whether the source is infectious (e.g. bacterial) or non-infectious (e.g. gout). Cultures can take days to result, so decisions about surgery are often made with incomplete data. Novel diagnostics are thus needed. The ""Sepsis MetaScore"" (SMS) is an 11-mRNA host immune blood signature that can distinguish between infectious and non-infectious acute inflammation. It has been validated in multiple cohorts across heterogeneous clinical settings. AIM: To study whether the SMS holds diagnostic validity in determining the etiology of acute arthritis. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, prospective, non-interventional clinical study of the SMS. All patients undergoing work-up for a septic primary joint were enrolled. Patients proceeded through the normal standard-of-care pathway, including joint aspiration and inflammatory labs [white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)]. Venous blood was also drawn into PAX gene RNA-stabilizing tubes and mRNAs were measured using Nano String nCounter. SMS was calculated blinded to clinical results. RESULTS: A total of 20 samples were included, of which 11 were infected based on aspiration or intra-operative cultures. The SMS had an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.87 for separating infectious from non-infectious conditions. For comparison, the AUROCs for ESR = 0.58, CRP = 0.6, and WBC = 0.59. At 100% sensitivity for infection, the specificity of the SMS was 40%, meaning nearly half of non-septic patients could have been ruled out for further intervention. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, SMS showed a high level of diagnostic accuracy in predicting septic joints compared to other diagnostic biomarkers. This quick blood test could be an important tool for early, accurate identification of acute septic joints and need for emergent surgery, improving clinical care and healthcare spending."
15611288,CD8 epitope escape and reversion in acute HCV infection.,2004,"In the setting of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, robust HCV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are associated with initial control of viremia. Despite these responses, 70-80% of individuals develop persistent infection. Although viral escape from CD8 responses has been illustrated in the chimpanzee model of HCV infection, the effect of CD8 selection pressure on viral evolution and containment in acute HCV infection in humans remains unclear. Here, we examined viral evolution in an immunodominant human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B8-restricted NS3 epitope in subjects with acute HCV infection. Development of mutations within the epitope coincided with loss of strong ex vivo tetramer and interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot responses, and endogenous expression of variant NS3 sequences suggested that the selected mutations altered processing and presentation of the variant epitope. Analysis of NS3 sequences from 30 additional chronic HCV-infected subjects revealed a strong association between sequence variation within this region and expression of HLA-B8, supporting reproducible allele-specific selection pressures at the population level. Interestingly, transmission of an HLA-B8-associated escape mutation to an HLA-B8 negative subject resulted in rapid reversion of the mutation. Together, these data indicate that viral escape from CD8+ T cell responses occurs during human HCV infection and that acute immune selection pressure is of sufficient magnitude to influence HCV evolution."
41466471,Alactic base excess as an early predictor of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective observational study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early detection and intervention are essential for improving clinical outcomes. This study investigates the predictive utility of alactic base excess (ABE) as an early biomarker for SA-AKI within the first 24 h of hospital or emergency department admission. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India from May 2022 to April 2023. Adult patients (>/= 18 years) diagnosed with sepsis at hospital/emergency/intensive care unit (ICU) admission were enrolled. ABE was calculated at 0, 12, and 24 h after admission to hospital or emergency department by adjusting standard base excess for serum lactate levels. The primary outcome was the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Secondary outcomes included AKI severity, stratification by ABE ranges, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 369 enrolled patients, 159 (43%) developed AKI, and 66 (17.9%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Baseline ABE remained a significant independent predictor, with each 1 mmol/L increase (less negative value) associated with an 11% reduction in AKI risk (adjusted OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, p = 0.030). More negative baseline ABE values were significantly associated with both increased AKI incidence and mortality. ABE measurements at 12 and 24 h were not independently predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ABE is a cost-effective, easily obtainable biomarker that independently associates with SA-AKI and correlates with in-hospital mortality. Its early use in sepsis management may improve risk stratification and outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Multicenter validation is recommended. Trial registration number The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/07/044168), dated 20/07/2022."
25556709,Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy sepsis and the rise in carbapenem antibiotic use.,2015,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine the number of hospital admissions for sepsis following transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy, and the rate of both prophylactic and therapeutic use of carbapenem antibiotics for TRUS biopsy, at a single institution. METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from the medical records electronic database of Cabrini Health, a private metropolitan hospital, was queried for coding of admissions under any admitting urologist for sepsis and prostate-related infections from 2009 to 2012. Records were examined for whether a TRUS biopsy had been performed within 14 days prior and if a therapeutic carbapenem was required. The database also queried the use of carbapenems as prophylaxis in patients undergoing TRUS biopsy. RESULTS: Of the 63 admissions for TRUS biopsy sepsis, multi-drug-resistant organisms were isolated from 26 (41%). Twenty-three admissions were from the 1937 patients who underwent a TRUS biopsy at Cabrini (a sepsis rate of 1.2%) and 40 were following TRUS biopsies at other centres. Thirty-seven (58.7%) patients received therapeutic carbapenems either empirically, or after culture results. Of the 1937 Cabrini TRUS biopsy patients, 154 (8%) were given a carbapenem as prophylaxis, with a rapid increase in prophylactic use over the 4 years studied from 0.25% to 13%. CONCLUSION: This study did not show evidence of an increasing rate of hospital admissions for TRUS biopsy sepsis at this institution. However, there was a dramatic uptake in prophylactic administration of carbapenems. Increasing carbapenem use may contribute to development of carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Alternative methods of prostate biopsy that avoid sepsis should be considered."
15646064,Virological and immunological response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected children: genotypic and phenotypic assays in monitoring virological failure.,2004,"Children differ from adults in both natural history of HIV-1 infection and their response to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). ART appears to be less successful in children than in adults at reducing HIV-1 RNA to below the level of detection of current assays. Nonetheless, children receiving ART frequently experience rises in CD4 cell counts, even in the absence of full virological suppression in plasma (discordant response). This immune repopulation in the presence of viral replication may increase the risk of emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. While the rationale for resistance testing is to optimise therapy, particularly when drugs are being changed following virological failure, it should be pointed out that currently available genotypic and phenotypic assays fail to detect drug resistance in about one third of viremic ART-treated children. This cannot be fully explained by the limitation of assays in detecting minor variants; factors other than resistance might be involved in the failure of therapy. Reduced fitness of drug-resistant viral variants is also unlikely to fully explain the discordant response to therapy, since immunological recovery is often observed even in the absence of detectable drug resistance. Rather, restoration of thymic function and higher thymic output may play a critical role in sustaining peripheral CD4 cell increases despite the persistence of viral replication. Such immune recovery might also drive the evolution of the replicating viruses."
41465803,Laparoscopic Management of Boerhaave Syndrome: Case Series and Narrative Review.,2025,"Boerhaave syndrome, or spontaneous rupture of the esophageal wall, is a rare condition that occurs after a violent increase in intraesophageal pressure associated with negative intrathoracic pressure after forceful vomiting or retching. Rupture, usually transmural, often occurs in the distal esophagus and can be complicated by mediastinitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction. Despite the aid of imaging in diagnosis and rapid management, it is still characterized by a high mortality rate. Surgical and endoscopic approaches are the mainstays of treatment. Case presentation: Here, we describe three cases of Boerhaave's syndrome managed with minimally invasive surgical treatment and provide a brief literature review of the treatment methods for this rare condition. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and prompt management by a multidisciplinary team increase the chances of survival. The laparoscopic approach is beneficial and can successfully treat esophageal tears associated with this syndrome in early or delayed timing."
20040701,Fluconazole prophylaxis in high-risk neonates.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the literature regarding the use of fluconazole prophylaxis in high-risk neonates. DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (February 2001-August 2009) using the search terms fluconazole and prophylaxis, with limits for age group (ie, birth-18 y). Reference citations from identified articles were also reviewed. DATA SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All prospective and retrospective studies in English identified from MEDLINE were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Critically ill neonates possess a number of risk factors that predispose them to fungal colonization with Candida spp. In many cases, colonization may progress to invasive systemic infections despite efforts aimed at early diagnosis and treatment. Because of its success among immunocompromised patients, fluconazole prophylaxis has been suggested as a possible approach for reducing the rates of both colonization and invasive fungal infections among at-risk neonates. To date, 4 prospective randomized controlled trials and 8 retrospective cohort studies have examined fluconazole prophylaxis in neonates. Although fluconazole prophylaxis appears to reduce the rates of colonization and invasive fungal infections, no trial in this review was able to demonstrate a significant difference in long-term morbidity or mortality. Concerns also remain regarding the adverse effects associated with prolonged exposure to fluconazole therapy. Lack of standardized study designs and treatment regimens also limit widespread recommendation for the use of fluconazole prophylaxis in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: While it may be beneficial for critically ill neonates with certain predisposing risk factors (eg, central venous access, sustained exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, or units with significantly high incidence of invasive fungal infections), existing research does not support the use of fluconazole prophylaxis based on birth weight or gestational age alone. Multifactor analysis evaluating the effect of fluconazole prophylaxis is necessary to establish which neonates would benefit from this practice."
15675496,"Uptake of interventions, outcomes and challenges in caring for HIV-exposed infants in Kingston, Jamaica.",2004,"BACKGROUND: In a few Caribbean islands, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) of HIV with zidovudine prophylaxis has reduced transmission rates from 27 - 44% to 5.5 - 9 %. OBJECTIVES: To highlight the uptake of interventions, preliminary outcomes and challenges in caring for HIV-exposed infants in a pMTCT HIVprogramme in a resource-limited setting. METHOD: A cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women were identified at the leading maternity centres in Greater Kingston through HIV counselling and testing and enrolled in the Kingston Paediatric and Perinatal HIV/AIDS Programme. Antiretroviralprophylaxis with zidovudine or nevirapine was given to the HIV-positive women and their newborns along with formula feeding. Some infants were enrolled retrospectively and followed irrespective of whether they had or had not received antiretroviral prophylaxis. A multidisciplinary team at the paediatric centres supervised protocol-driven management of the infants. Infants were followed for clinical progress and definitive HIV-infection status was to be confirmed at 18 months of age by ELISA or the Determine Rapid Test. RESULTS: During September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2003, 132 HIV-exposed infants were identified. For those infants prospectively enrolled (78), 97% received antiretroviral prophylaxis and 90% were not breastfed For all HIV-exposed children, 90% received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and 88% continued follow-up care. Ninety-two per cent of all the infants remained asymptomatic and five died; of these deaths one is possibly HIV-related (severe sepsis at 11 weeks). This infant was retrospectively identified, had received no antiretroviral prophylaxis and was breastfed The main programme challenges, which were overcome, included the impact of stigma, compliance with antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis, breast-milk substitution and follow-up care. Financial constraints and laboratory quality assurance issues limited early diagnosis of HIV infection. CONCLUSION: Despite the challenges, the expected outcome is to prevent 50 new cases of HIV/AIDS in children living in Greater Kingston per year (300 over six years)."
31893550,"Thiazolidine-2,4-dione-based irreversible allosteric IKK-beta kinase inhibitors: Optimization into in vivo active anti-inflammatory agents.",2020,"Selective kinase inhibitors development is a cumbersome task because of ATP binding sites similarities across kinases. On contrast, irreversible allosteric covalent inhibition offers opportunity to develop novel selective kinase inhibitors. Previously, we reported thiazolidine-2,4-dione lead compounds eliciting in vitro irreversible allosteric inhibition of IKK-beta. Herein, we address optimization into in vivo active anti-inflammatory agents. We successfully developed potent IKK-beta inhibitors with the most potent compound eliciting IC(50) = 0.20 muM. Cellular assay of a set of active compounds using bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages elucidated significant in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro evaluation of microsomal and plasma stabilities showed that the promising compound 7a is more stable than compound 7p. Finally, in vivo evaluation of 7a, which has been conducted in a model of LPS-induced septic shock in mice, showed its ability to protect mice against septic shock induced mortality. Accordingly, this study presents compound 7a as a novel potential irreversible allosteric covalent inhibitor of IKK-beta with verified in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity."
15810502,"[Microbiological analysis of blood culture obtained from children hospitalized at the Gastroenterology, Oncology and Daily Chemotherapy Wards of the Children's Memorial Health Institute in the years 1999-2002].",2004,"The aim of the study was to examine correlations between the use of different kinds of intravascular catheters and the type of microorganisms isolated from blood cultures. Blood samples obtained from gastroenterology, oncology and daily chemotherapy wards were examined. The samples were taken from catheter and peripheral blood in situations where blood infection was suspected. In positive blood samples Gram-positive bacteria, especially methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci, were dominant. Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella sp., E. coli, Enterobacter sp.) were the most often isolated among Gram-negative bacteria. The share of Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacilli and fungi was greater in the case of samples taken from catheters. The domination of CNS is frequently connected with catheter colonisation or contamination of samples. Intravascular catheters predispose to Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods and fungal infections."
25517275,Inverse association between serum creatinine and mortality in acute kidney injury.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading precipitant of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and is associated with a high mortality rate. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for dialysis and mortality in a cohort of AKI patients of predominantly septic etiology. METHODS: Adult patients from an ICU for whom nephrology consultation was requested were included. End-stage chronic renal failure and kidney transplant patients were excluded. RESULTS: 114 patients were followed. Most had sepsis (84%), AKIN stage 3 (69%) and oliguria (62%) at first consultation. Dialysis was performed in 66% and overall mortality was 70%. Median serum creatinine in survivors and non-survivors was 3.95 mg/dl (2.63 - 5.28) and 2.75 mg/dl (1.81 - 3.69), respectively. In the multivariable models, oliguria and serum urea were positively associated with dialysis; otherwise, a lower serum creatinine at first consultation was independently associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of septic AKI, oliguria and serum urea were the main indications for dialysis. We also described an inverse association between serum creatinine and mortality. Potential explanations for this finding include: delay in diagnosis, fluid overload with hemodilution of serum creatinine or poor nutritional status. This finding may also help to explain the low discriminative power of general severity scores - that assign higher risks to higher creatinine levels - in septic AKI patients."
32045375,Endocan - a potential diagnostic marker for early onset sepsis in neonates.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal early onset sepsis assessment is based on the history of pregnancy and delivery and nonspecific clinical signs. None of the biomarkers currently in use for clinical practice has adequate prognostic value, so it is not possible to clearly distinguish neonates with culture-proven sepsis from those with only risk factors or clinical suspicion. Endocan is an endothelial mediator involved in the inflammatory response that is present in low concentrations in the serum of healthy subjects, and in much higher concentrations in patients with SIRS and septic shock. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of serum endocan serum levels as a biomarker for the diagnosis of neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS). METHODOLOGY: Serum endocan concentration was measured in newborns with clinical suspicion of EOS admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on day 1, 3 and 7. RESULTS: Serum endocan levels were significantly increased in septic compared to non-septic neonates in the early stages of sepsis (2.43 +/- 0.95 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.57, p = 0.004), continued to rise up to 72 hours from onset and then decreased by the seventh day under treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for endocan as an early marker for diagnosis and follow-up in neonatal EOS. Studies on a larger number of cases are needed in order to establish the practical utility of this molecule as a diagnostic tool for clinical practice."
41478040,"SERS on analyte-enriched blood for rapid, culture-free sepsis recognition and causative pathogen identification with super operational neural networks.",2026,"Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, yet routine diagnostics are slow, culture-dependent, and often lack the sensitivity or specificity required for early intervention. Prior studies rarely demonstrate clinical-grade performance on blood culture samples or in independent external cohorts. We address these gaps with a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and deep learning workflow (SERS-DL) that performs sepsis instance recognition and causative pathogen identification directly from target-analyte enriched blood. We assembled a primary dataset of SERS spectra acquired from 653 analyte-enriched blood samples collected at a tertiary hospital in Qatar and an external blind cohort of 70 independent samples. After rigorous preprocessing and class-weighted augmentation of SERS spectra, we trained SuperRamanNet, a lightweight one-dimensional classifier based on super operational neural networks. In five-fold, sample-contained cross-validation, the system achieved 99.67 % accuracy for binary sepsis recognition and 98.84 % accuracy for six-class pathogen identification. On the external cohort, performance remained high at 98.28 % for pathogen typing, indicating robust generalizability. Comparative benchmarks and ablation studies confirmed consistent gains over convolutional and operational baselines and quantified the impact of augmentation and architectural choices. Residual confusions were concentrated between control and Escherichia coli and among certain Gram-negative classes, underscoring the need for improved raw class balance during blood sample collection. Overall, this rapid, culture-free, and portable SERS-DL pipeline delivers near clinical-grade accuracy for sepsis detection and pathogen identification directly from blood. The compact model and streamlined workflow support point-of-care translation, with potential to accelerate triage, guide early therapy, and reduce the global sepsis burden."
31845296,Time-kill curves of daptomycin and Monte Carlo simulation for the treatment of bacteraemia caused by Enterococcus faecium.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of daptomycin against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteraemia using computer modelling. METHODS: Data obtained in vitro from time-kill curves were evaluated by PK/PD modelling and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the logarithmic reduction in the number of colony-forming units (CFU)/mL over 18 days of daptomycin treatment at 6, 8, and 10 mg/kg doses every 24 or 48 h and with variations in creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) of 15-29, 30-49, and 50-100 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the probability of target attainment (PTA) for an area under the unbound drug concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) > 36 at the same doses and CL(CR). RESULTS: Static time-kill model was employed to investigate the antibacterial efficacy of constant daptomycin concentrations. The time-kill curve analysis was performed using mathematical modelling based on a Hill coefficient factor. There was an expressive reduction (> 2 Log CFU/mL) over 18 days of daptomycin treatment in 75th percentile of individuals with CL(CR) of 15-100 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) with daptomycin 6-10 mg/kg/day, except for daptomycin every 48 h. Using fAUC/MIC > 36, PTA was > 90% at MICs </= 2 mug/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Higher daptomycin doses were associated with higher mortality in time-kill curves. The simulations indicated that independent of the CL(CR) the therapeutic responses of VRE occur with doses of daptomycin >/= 6 mg/kg/day and daptomycin every 48 h is insufficient to treat enterococcal bacteraemia."
25654957,Parotid abscess: a retrospective study of 14 cases at a regional hospital in Taiwan.,2014,"PROBLEM/OBJECTIVE: Acute suppurative sialadenitis commonly affects the parotid gland. However, acute suppurative parotitis with abscess formation is less common and possibly complicated by deep neck space infection and sepsis. Our aim was to analyze the clinical features, radiological findings, treatment modalities, and microbiology of parotid abscesses treated at a regional hospital in Taiwan over a 15-year period. METHODS: Records from patients diagnosed with acute suppurative parotitis or parotid abscesses between January 1998 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Parotid abscesses were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) examinations. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (9 males; mean age+standard deviation, 49.6 +/- 14.4 [range, 22-75] years) with parotid abscesses were included. Painful swelling at the angle of the jaw was the most common symptom. All patients sustained unilateral parotid abscesses, with left-sided lesions in 10 patients, and right-sided ones in 4 patients. Radiographically, 13 of 14 abscess lesions were located in the superficial lobe, and 1 was in the deep lobe of the parotid gland. Besides sufficient fluid hydration, maintenance of good oral hygiene, and administration of parenteral antibiotics, all patients were treated with surgical incision and drainage. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the organism most commonly isolated from abscess cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Parotid abscesses were found in about one fifth of patients with acute infectious parotid disease. Parenteral antibiotics plus surgical incision and drainage was the treatment of choice."

This represents another of the strange potential hazards of serious microwave related injuries.
41624787,Anaerobic pericarditis due to Clostridium ramosum: First known case report.,2026,"Anaerobic pathogens are uncommon etiologies of pericardial infections. Clostridium ramosum, an obligate anaerobic gram-positive bacillus and member of the normal gastrointestinal flora, is generally considered of low virulence but has been implicated in invasive infections in elderly or immunocompromised individuals. We report the first documented case of Clostridium ramosum pericarditis. An 85-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, splenomegaly with bicytopenia, and depression was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion on transthoracic echocardiography. Follow-up imaging revealed a reduced ejection fraction, progressive aortic dilation, and early tamponade physiology. Despite being asymptomatic, he underwent pericardiocentesis, which yielded 400 mL of fluid. Gram stain demonstrated gram-positive bacilli, later identified on anaerobic culture as Clostridium ramosum. Blood cultures remained negative. He was treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam followed by oral metronidazole, with resolution of the effusion and no recurrence on follow-up. This case highlights that anaerobic pericarditis can occur in the absence of systemic symptoms or sepsis, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities that predispose to bacterial translocation. Timely drainage and targeted antimicrobial therapy are essential for favorable outcomes. Importantly, routine anaerobic cultures of pericardial fluid should be considered to avoid missed diagnoses. Recognition of rare anaerobic pathogens in pericardial infections expands the understanding of their pathogenic potential and informs future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."
31804363,Septic shock caused by Rhizobium radiobacter in an elderly woman: A case report.,2019,"RATIONALE: Rhizobium radiobacter is a Gram-negative pathogen present in soil and plants. Cases of R radiobacter infection in immunocompromised hosts have been sporadically reported. However, septic shock caused by R radiobacter is rarely seen. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we describe an elderly patient with a rapid progression of watery diarrhea, anorexia, fever, weakness, oliguria, and shock. Blood results showed increased total white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. Arterial blood gas results showed hypoxia and elevated lactate level. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 11. Blood culture at admission showed Gram-negative bacteria, which were later confirmed as R radiobacter. DIAGNOSIS: Septic shock caused by R Radiobacter. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with intravenous cefoperazone/sulbactam and sequential oral levofloxacin. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered completely. CONCLUSION: R radiobacter may be considered as a potential opportunistic pathogen that may cause severe sepsis in elderly patients, especially those with multiple underlying diseases."
25673254,"Prehospital treatment of sepsis: what really makes the ""golden hour"" golden?",2014,"The early recognition of severe sepsis is important; however, early identification of severe sepsis can be challenging, especially in the prehospital setting. As previous research has shown, advanced notification of time-sensitive disease states by prehospital personnel can improve outcomes and time to initiation of treatments. Prehospital personnel can potentially impact outcomes in sepsis through early identification and treatment implementations, improving processes of care and transition of care. Further research is needed for a full evaluation of prehospital treatment effects of identification of sepsis and treatment by prehospital personnel and the impact on outcomes."
41476244,Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: recent insights on the role and clinical application of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.,2025,"Sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection. Neutrophils play a vital role in this process, which can lead to immunothrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This study aimed to validate the impact of NETs biomarkers in evaluating their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic indicators in critical care for patients with sepsis. We conducted a case-control study with a 7-day follow-up to assess mortality in 138 sepsis patients, focusing specifically on the occurrence of DIC. Additionally, 80 healthy volunteers, matched by age and sex, served as controls. Our findings reveal a strong connection between histones in sepsis and both the initial inflammatory response and sepsis-related coagulopathy/DIC. Furthermore, we found that myeloperoxidase can effectively predict short-term mortality among sepsis patients, regardless of their DIC status. This study highlights a concerning simultaneous increase in myeloperoxidase and histones (thresholds of > 84.9 ng/ml and > 126.4 ng/ml, respectively), which may serve as vital indicators indicating the urgent need for NETs inhibitors in sepsis treatment. Applying this approach, we anticipate a significant reduction in thrombotic events and mortality, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes in the management of critical sepsis."
41497347,Copper-Induced Cell Death in Renal Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.,2025,"Copper dyshomeostasis and the resulting induction of cuproptosis, a novel regulated cell death pathway driven by mitochondrial copper overload, play a critical role in renal pathophysiology. Cuproptosis is characterized by FDX1-mediated copper reduction, irreversible aggregation of lipoylated TCA cycle enzymes, such as dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, and destabilization of iron‒sulfur cluster proteins, leading to proteotoxic mitochondrial collapse. The kidney's high vulnerability arises from its filtration and metabolic functions. This review consolidates evidence linking cuproptosis to various renal disorders, including acute kidney injury (eg, sepsis-induced, cisplatin-induced, and ischemia-reperfusion injury), diabetic nephropathy through mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation, and chronic kidney disease involving podocyte damage or context-dependent dysregulation in fibrosis and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Notably, cuproptosis and ferroptosis interact synergistically through shared mechanisms, where glutathione depletion or iron overload exacerbates both pathways, while mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation create a self-perpetuating injury cycle. Emerging diagnostic strategies utilize cuproptosis-related biomarkers for early detection, supported by various prediction models. In therapeutic contexts, copper chelators, transporter modulators, and dual-pathway inhibitors targeting both cuproptosis and ferroptosis mitigate renal damage in preclinical models. Dietary interventions that modulate copper bioavailability also hold promise. However, challenges remain, including identifying renal cell type-specific mechanisms, developing noninvasive biomarkers, optimizing kidney-targeted nanotherapeutics, and preventing iatrogenic copper deficiency. Future research may focus on translational applications and the physiological roles of cuproptosis in renal repair. Targeting cuproptosis offers a promising avenue for innovative diagnostics and treatments in nephrology."
15651310,[Bacterial meningitis: determination of pathogens and therapeutic management].,2004,"Recent aspects of pathogen determination and therapeutic management are reviewed based on a clinical analysis of 50 of our adult patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). The sensitivity for detecting pathogens using gram-stained smears and cultures of CSF was high in untreated patients, but low in patients previously treated with antibiotics. Latex agglutination for antibodies of pathogens is rapid and has a potential for determining pathogens in partially treated meningitis. The PCR also has a potential for determining pathogens in pre-treated, culture-negative cases and for detecting whether the bacterial pathogen is resistant or sensitive to antibiotics. The initial empiric regimen of antibiotics has been modified with elevation in the detection rate of drug-resistant bacilli. The proportion of patients undergoing treatment with VCM and/or Carbapenems has recently increased at our department. A combination of dexamethasone under administration of antibiotics has also been established as effective in adult BM. On admission, some patients are difficult to diagnose as BM rather than herpes simplex encephalitis (HSVE). A serum CRP value of >2.0 mg/dl proved useful for such different diagnosis in our patients. The predictors of a poor outcome based on multivariate logistic analysis in our BM patients were level of unconsciousness and sepsis."
19963521,Cardiovascular impact of manual and automated turns in ICU.,2009,"Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are typically turned manually by nursing staff to reduce the risk of developing ventilator associated pneumonia and other problems in the lungs. However, turning can induce changes in the heart rate and blood pressure that can at times have a destabilizing effect. We report here on the early stage of a study that has been undertaken to measure the cardiovascular impact of manual turning, and compare it to changes induced when patients lie on automated beds that turn continuously. Heart rate and blood pressure data were analyzed over ensembles of turns with autoregressive models for comparing baseline level to the dynamic response. Manual turning stimulated a response in the heart rate that lasted for a median of 20 minutes and was of magnitude 5 to 13 bpm. The corresponding response in mean arterial pressure was 11 to 19 mm Hg, lasting for 8 to 21 minutes. There was no discernible response of either variable to automated turns."

In both cases, pre-existing wounds were inoculated by wading in contaminated sea water. One of the patients died from septic multiorgan failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fatality due to a V. vulnificus infection to have occurred in Germany. Microbiological analysis revealed high concentrations of V. vulnificus in sea water along the coastline, following a period when water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C for more than 2 weeks."

20049085,"Energy expenditure and energy intake - Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition, Chapter 3.",2009,"The energy expenditure (24h total energy expenditure, TEE) of a healthy individual or a patient is a vital reference point for nutritional therapy to maintain body mass. TEE is usually determined by measuring resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry or by estimation with the help of formulae like the formula of Harris and Benedict with an accuracy of +/-20%. Further components of TEE (PAL, DIT) are estimated afterwards. TEE in intensive care patients is generally only 0-7% higher than REE, due to a low PAL and lower DIT. While diseases, like particularly sepsis, trauma and burns, cause a clinically relevant increase in REE between 40-80%, in many diseases, TEE is not markedly different from REE. A standard formula should not be used in critically ill patients, since energy expenditure changes depending on the course and the severity of disease. A clinical deterioration due to shock, severe sepsis or septic shock may lead to a drop of REE to a level only slightly (20%) above the normal REE of a healthy subject. Predominantly immobile patients should receive an energy intake between 1.0-1.2 times the determined REE, while immobile malnourished patients should receive a stepwise increased intake of 1.1-1.3 times the REE over a longer period. Critically ill patients in the acute stage of disease should be supplied equal or lower to the current TEE, energy intake should be increased stepwise up to 1.2 times (or up to 1.5 times in malnourished patients) thereafter."

A 68-year-old male had a Thoratec-Heartmate LVAD implanted as destination therapy. After an uneventful (apart from early fever) recovery in the intensive care unit, the patient developed an intractable high temperature, and generalized sepsis and died 21 days following implant. The white cell blood count never exceeded the guard limits, and the patient succumbed with severe LVAD valve malfunction. At post-mortem examination friable material consisting of fungal hyphae was found on the inflow and outflow valves. According to published clinical trials, infection accounts for more than 40% of mortality in LVAD supported patients. Fungal LVAD endocarditis is a particularly deadly disease. Successful management requires a high level of suspicion and timely institution of antifungal therapy to control the infection. This has led some authors to recommend empiric antifungal therapy in LVAD recipients with culture-negative sepsis unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics."

19930315,Herpes simplex virus sepsis and acute liver failure.,2009,"Acute liver failure is a life threatening disease mostly triggered by drug-induced or toxic liver damage or viral hepatitis. Herpes Simplex virus (HSV) hepatitis is rare and accounts for only 1% of all acute liver failures. The importance of HSV-induced acute liver failure is based on its extremely severe clinical course with lethality rates of almost 75%. HSV hepatitis is just one of several clinical manifestations of HSV sepsis leading more frequently to encephalitis, pneumonia and esophagitis. Local herpes infection or recurrence of dermal lesions (herpes labialis, herpes genitalis), however, is common and account for the high prevalence of HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection in adults. Another rare entity is visual dissemination, which mostly affects immunocompromised patients. Compromised cellular immunity is a major risk factor for HSV sepsis because of either primary infection or reactivation of occult chronic HSV infection. Delayed diagnosis without antiviral therapy significantly contributes to the unfavorable outcome. Typically, anicteric hepatitis is seen in patients with HSV hepatitis. Because of its low incidence, however, and the lack of dermal manifestations, HSV hepatitis is rarely considered in the context of acute liver failure. In addition, diagnostic tests might not always be available. Therefore, it is a generally accepted consensus to begin antiviral therapy pre-emptively with acyclovir in cases of acute liver failure of unknown origin, in which high urgency (HU) liver transplantation remains the only therapeutical option. Even in the case of early specific therapy, sepsis may prevail and the indication for HU transplantation must be evaluated carefully. The outcome after liver transplantation for HSV-induced liver failure with reported survival rates of more than 40% is good. Because of the risk of recurrence, lifelong prophylaxis with acyclovir is recommended."
31929471,A 5-year retrospective study of melioidosis cases treated in a district specialist hospital.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative aerobic bacillus, found in the soil and surface water. Treating melioidosis has been a challenge in district hospitals due to high usage of broad spectrum antibiotics and prolonged hospitalisation. This study is to review the patients' demography, clinical presentations and microbiological data. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out on patients admitted with culture positive for melioidosis from year 2013 to 2017 in Hospital Teluk Intan, Perak. RESULTS: There were a total of 46 confirmed cases of melioidosis. Majority of the patients were working in the agricultural and farming (28.6%), and factories (25.7%). Thirty-one patients had diabetes mellitus (71.1%). Presentations of patients with melioidosis included pneumonia (54.3%), skin and soft tissue infection (19.6%), deep abscesses (15.2%) and bone and joint infections (13%). An average of 5.8 days was needed to confirm the diagnosis of melioidosis via positive culture. However, only 39.4% of these patients were started on ceftazidime or carbapenem as the empirical therapy. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate for melioidosis was 46% and the mortality rate was 52%. Our microbial cultures showed good sensitivity towards cotrimoxazole (97.1%), ceftazidime (100%) and carbapenem (100%). CONCLUSION: Melioidosis carries high mortality rate, especially with lung involvement and bacteremia. Physicians should have high clinical suspicion for melioidosis cases to give appropriate antimelioidosis therapy early."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of emergency department and in-hospital patient encounters from 2014 to 2018. SETTING: One community and two academic hospitals in Maryland. PATIENTS: All patients 18 years old or older presenting to the emergency department or admitted to any acute inpatient medical or surgical unit including patients discharged from the emergency department. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From the electronic health record, 233,252 emergency department and inpatient encounters were identified. Patient data were used to develop and validate electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping, an adaptation of ""the Centers for Disease Control Adult Sepsis Event toolkit"" that accounts for comorbid conditions when identifying sepsis patients. The performance of this novel system was then compared with 1) physician case review and 2) three other commonly used strategies using metrics of sensitivity and precision relative to sepsis billing codes, termed ""billing code sensitivity"" and ""billing code predictive value."" Physician review of electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping identified cases confirmed 79% as having sepsis; 88% were confirmed or had a billing code for sepsis; and 99% were confirmed, had a billing code, or received at least 4 days of antibiotics. At comparable billing code sensitivity (0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93), electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping had a higher billing code predictive value (0.32; 95% CI, 0.30-0.34) than either the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Sepsis Core Measure (SEP-1) definition or the Sepsis-3 consensus definition (0.12; 95% CI, 0.11-0.13; and 0.07; 95% CI, 0.07-0.08, respectively). When compared with electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping, Adult Sepsis Event had a lower billing code sensitivity (0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.78) and similar billing code predictive value (0.29; 95% CI, 0.26-0.31). Electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping identified patients with higher in-hospital mortality and nearly one-half as many false-positive cases when compared with SEP-1 and Sepsis-3. CONCLUSIONS: By accounting for comorbid conditions, electronic health record-based sepsis phenotyping exhibited better performance when compared with other automated definitions of sepsis."
32038544,Computer-Aided Design of Antimicrobial Peptides: Are We Generating Effective Drug Candidates?,2019,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), especially antibacterial peptides, have been widely investigated as potential alternatives to antibiotic-based therapies. Indeed, naturally occurring and synthetic AMPs have shown promising results against a series of clinically relevant bacteria. Even so, this class of antimicrobials has continuously failed clinical trials at some point, highlighting the importance of AMP optimization. In this context, the computer-aided design of AMPs has put together crucial information on chemical parameters and bioactivities in AMP sequences, thus providing modes of prediction to evaluate the antibacterial potential of a candidate sequence before synthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) computational models, for instance, have greatly contributed to AMP sequence optimization aimed at improved biological activities. In addition to machine-learning methods, the de novo design, linguistic model, pattern insertion methods, and genetic algorithms, have shown the potential to boost the automated design of AMPs. However, how successful have these approaches been in generating effective antibacterial drug candidates? Bearing this in mind, this review will focus on the main computational strategies that have generated AMPs with promising activities against pathogenic bacteria, as well as anti-infective potential in different animal models, including sepsis and cutaneous infections. Moreover, we will point out recent studies on the computer-aided design of antibiofilm peptides. As expected from automated design strategies, diverse candidate sequences with different structural arrangements have been generated and deposited in databases. We will, therefore, also discuss the structural diversity that has been engendered."
32166273,Mortality Risk Profiles for Sepsis: A Novel Longitudinal and Multivariable Approach.,2019,"To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the ""day 1"" and ""change"" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk."
31826930,Successful Use of Cidofovir in an Immunocompetent Child With Severe Adenoviral Sepsis.,2020,"Adenovirus infection is common in childhood and is generally associated with self-limited disease. Cidofovir, a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, is used to treat adenovirus infection in select populations but is not often recommended for immunocompetent patients because of limited antiviral activity and nephrotoxicity. Here, we report a case of fulminant adenovirus infection associated with lymphopenia and multiple organ failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in a previously healthy child. After 1 week of supportive therapy, the patient had persistent organ failure and continued to have adenoviremia of >560 000 copies per mL. Weekly doses of cidofovir with concurrent probenecid for renal protection was initiated. Adenovirus blood load declined after the first cidofovir dose, becoming undetectable after 3 doses. The patient was successfully decannulated from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, extubated, and eventually discharged at his functional baseline without need for ongoing respiratory support. Lymphopenia improved after viremia resolved, and a subsequent immunologic workup revealed no evidence of primary immunodeficiency. The viral isolate was genotyped as adenovirus type 7. This case reveals the successful use of cidofovir for management of severe adenovirus infection in a previously healthy child. To date, there are no universally accepted recommendations for the use of cidofovir in this population. Further study is warranted to determine the potential role of cidofovir in treating severe adenovirus infections in immunocompetent children."
25657770,"Neonatal meningitis: risk factors, causes, and neurologic complications.",2014,"OBJECTIVE: Neonates are at greater risk for sepsis and meningitis than other ages and in spite of rapid diagnoses of pathogens and treatments, they still contribute to complications and mortality. This study determines risk factors, causes, and neurologic complications of neonatal meningitis in hospitalized neonates. MATERIAL & METHODS: In this descriptive, cross sectional study, we evaluated 415 neonates with sepsis and meningitis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at our center between 2008 and 2012. The data that was recorded was age, sex, birth weight, prenatal risk factors, clinical features, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and brain sonographic findings and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients had meningitis. Eleven cases (55%) were male. The mean age was 8. 41 days and mean birth weight was 2891.5+/-766 grams. Poor feeding, seizures, and tachypnea were detected in 12 (60%), 11 (55%), and 6 (30%) patients, respectively. Prenatal risk factors were prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal vaginitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, prematurity, low birth weights, and asphyxia. Four patients had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures with klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (50%), Enterococcus spp. 1 (25%), and Group B streptococcus 1 (25%) cases, respectively. Two cases had positive blood cultures with klebsiella pneumoniae. Neurologic complications were brain edema, subdural effusion, and brain abscesses with hydrocephaly. One neonate (5%) died. CONCLUSION: Our study provides some information about risk factors, pathogens, and neurologic complications for neonatal meningitis. Prenatal assessments help to diagnose and reduce risk factors of this hazardous disease."
32329472,Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis A Diagnostic Dilemma in Puerperium: A Case Report.,2019,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a potentially life threatening dermatologic disorder characterized by widespread erythema, necrosis and bullas, detachment of epidermis and mucous membrane resulting in exfoliation, possible sepsis and even death. This is the first case report in Nepal of toxic epidermal necrolysis in puerperium. We present a case of a 28-years-old, P1L1 on fourth postoperative day following emergency lower segment caesarean section for cephalopelvic disproportion in latent phase of labour with uneventful antenatal period. She developed fever followed by rashes all over the body with hypotension, tachypnea and shortness of breath. Initially, she was diagnosed as a case of septic shock and transferred to intensive care unit from postnatal ward. She was managed with broad spectrum antibiotics and inotropes. Later on, it was found to be the case of Toxic epidermal necrolysis and managed with vancomycin and corticosteroids under the supervision of gynecology, dermatology and medicine team. Keywords: puerperium; toxic epidermal necrolysis; vancomycin."
32011992,Left colon interposition for esophageal reconstruction after perforation by metal blades ingestion: a case report.,2019,"Esophageal reconstruction with colonic or jejunal segment is a second choice treatment when the stomach is injured or not adequate for use. These reconstructions, whether pedicled or as free jejunal graft, are technically demanding and they are associated with high rate of morbidity and mortality. Complications are mainly due to insufficient blood supply and therefore anastomotic leak or stricture and graft necrosis. We describe the case of a 51-year-old psychiatric man with diagnosis of esophageal perforation after ingestion of metallic razor blades for suicide intent. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with endoscopic removal of the blades and apposition of endoscopic clips, be cause of esophageal mucosal perforation. Nevertheless, he developed a septic status caused by mediastinitis. The patient underwent several interventions to solve the sepsis and after complete recovery he was referred to our Department for esophageal reconstruction. During surgery we found that the stomach was unavailable for reconstruction, therefore a left colonic interposition pedicled on the left colic vessels was performed through the retrosternal route. During the postoperative course the patient developed acute respiratory failure and suppuration of the cervical wound. The postoperative course was complicated because of the poor compliance of the patient due to his psychiatric disorder. He was discharged in postoperative day (POD) 42 in good clinical conditions, on oral-only diet. Colonic interposition through the retrosternal route after esophagectomy is a technically demanding procedure, associated with high morbidity and mortality, but it is a feasible option when the stomach is not available for reconstruction."
15616826,Connatal tuberculosis in a very premature infant.,2005,"Connatal tuberculosis is increasing in incidence and the mortality and morbidity of this disease remains high. We report a 27-week-old, 896 g female premature infant who had mild respiratory distress syndrome after birth. She developed signs of infection, progressive pneumonia and atelectasis which did not respond to mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. At 41 days of age, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from the non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage. The isolate was sensitive to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide. Miliary tuberculosis was subsequently diagnosed in her mother on a chest X-ray film and sputum cultures. The infant was treated successfully with anti-tuberculosis drugs. She had normal growth and development at the chronological age of 20 months old. CONCLUSION: Connatal tuberculosis should be considered in premature infants with symptoms of sepsis refractory to antibiotics. Most premature infants with connatal tuberculosis have lung involvement, and non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage can be a useful procedure to establish the diagnosis."
20001880,Assessment of tissue cortisol activity.,2009,"The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with severe sepsis continues to be controversial. This arises in part from the lack of an accepted ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill. Historically, assessment of adrenal function in this population has relied on measurement of plasma total cortisol level, in a blood sample taken either at random or as part of a corticotropin stimulation test. However, an alternative is to focus on the site of glucocorticoid activity within the tissues as a potentially more useful index of functional adrenal status. We review the mechanisms known to affect tissue glucocorticoid activity and examine how they may be modified by critical illness. These include both free and interstitial cortisol concentrations, intracellular cortisol generation, and glucocorticoid-receptor activity and density. Changes in these factors are not reflected in plasma total cortisol concentrations, and more sophisticated techniques, including genetic transcriptional surveys, may be required to reveal the role of glucocorticoid insufficiency in critical illness."
20004964,Accurate and rapid identification of bacterial species from positive blood cultures with a DNA-based microarray platform: an observational study.,2010,"BACKGROUND: New DNA-based microarray platforms enable rapid detection and species identification of many pathogens, including bacteria. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time of a new molecular sepsis assay. METHODS: 2107 positive blood-culture samples of 3318 blood samples from patients with clinically suspected sepsis were investigated for bacterial species by both conventional culture and Prove-it sepsis assay (Mobidiag, Helsinki, Finland) in two centres (UK and Finland). The assay is a novel PCR and microarray method that is based on amplification and detection of gyrB, parE, and mecA genes of 50 bacterial species. Operators of the test assay were not aware of culture results. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. FINDINGS: 1807 of 2107 (86%) positive blood-culture samples included a pathogen covered by the assay. The assay had a clinical sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 93.6-95.7) and a specificity of 98.8% (98.1-99.2), and 100% for both measures for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. The assay was a mean 18 h faster than was the conventional culture-based method, which takes an additional 1-2 working days. 34 of 3284 (1.0%) samples were excluded because of technical and operator errors. INTERPRETATION: Definitive identification of bacterial species with this microarray platform was highly sensitive, specific, and faster than was the gold-standard culture-based method. This assay could enable fast and earlier evidence-based management for clinical sepsis."
25577143,Penehyclidine hydrochloride postconditioning on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by inhibition of inflammatory factors in a rodent model.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with acute lung injury (ALI) and high mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) postconditioning on ALI induced by sepsis in a rat model. METHODS: A rat model of ALI was induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The different doses of PHC were administrated intravenously at 30 min after LPS administration (low dose, 0.3 mg/kg; medium dose, 1.0 mg/kg, and high dose, 3.0 mg/kg). After 6 h, arterial blood samples were obtained for blood gas analyses. Meanwhile, lung tissue was harvested and lung injury was assessed by the histopathologic changes (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as the nuclear factor-kappa B protein expressions, and the myeloperoxidase activities in lung tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: LPS-induced severe lung injury evidenced by increased pathologic scores and lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which was accompanied by increases in the expression of pulmonary nuclear factor-kappa B protein and the activity of pulmonary myeloperoxidase and the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), pH, and the PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) decreased significantly and the carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) increased notedly after an LPS injection. All doses of PHC could significantly ameliorate lung injury and improve the previously mentioned variables (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Furthermore, the protection of medium dose (1.0 mg/kg) could be better than that of low or high dose. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that different doses of PHC, especially to medium dose, could prevent LPS-induced ALI in rats, at least in part, by inhibiting inflammatory response. Moreover, the protection of pharmacologic postconditioning with PHC is limited by a ""ceiling effect."""
31969743,Congenital vaginal obstruction in a newborn.,2019,"A transverse vaginal septum is a horizontal wall of tissue that has formed during embryologic development and essentially creates a blockage of the vagina. It can occur at different levels of the vagina. We report a neonate who was diagnosed antenatally with an enlarged lower abdominal mass suggestive of an enlarged urinary bladder with hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Shortly after birth, she developed urinary retention and neonatal sepsis. Following multiple postnatal investigations, she was found to have a vaginal septum with hydrometrocolpos."
41541174,A case report of complete penoscrotal transposition and associated anomalies in a newborn.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Penoscrotal transposition is a rare congenital abnormality in which the scrotum is positioned above the penis. It results from the disrupted development of the genital tubercle and labioscrotal folds. The exact embryological errors are not fully understood, but they may arise from a failure in their migration and fusion around 12 weeks of gestation. CASE PRESENTATION: A term male newborn was referred 4 h after birth due to respiratory distress, abnormal genitalia, and failure to pass meconium or urine. He had pulmonary hypertension, early-onset neonatal sepsis, complete penoscrotal transposition, and possibly an anorectal malformation. Evaluation showed elevated creatinine, hyperkalaemia, leucocytosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Despite supportive care-including antibiotics, fluids, correction of hyperkalaemia, and sildenafil-he deteriorated and died before surgery. The final diagnosis was a complex congenital anomaly, sepsis, and multiorgan failure leading to death. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Persistent scrotal transposition is associated with midline defects, including anorectal, cardiac, and gonadal anomalies. Early prenatal imaging and thorough postnatal assessments-such as echocardiography, renal imaging, and genetic testing-are essential. The complexity of this anomaly requires organised, multidisciplinary management. By focusing on key investigations and prompt interventions, even with limited resources, outcomes can be enhanced and future diagnostic and prognostic strategies improved. CONCLUSION: A rare complete penoscrotal transposition with multiple anomalies and sepsis highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care and enhanced antenatal screening."
41400853,"Risk factors for ICD-10-coded Respiratory Syncytial Virus-associated deaths in hospitalized patients in Germany before the COVID-19 pandemic (nationwide in-patient data, 2010-2019).",2026,"PURPOSE: We compared nationwide data on the clinical characteristics of deceased and non-deceased patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-coded hospitalization to evaluate potential risk factors for in-hospital fatality by age group. METHODS: Data from International Statistical Classification of Diseases (10th Revision)-based German Hospital Statistics for patients from 2010-2019 with a primary discharge diagnosis code for RSV-related pneumonia (J12.1), bronchitis (J20.5) or bronchiolitis (J21.0) were assessed by remote data retrieval. Selected underlying conditions and complications were reported stratified by age group and outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 612 (0.3% of 205,352) RSV-coded patients died in hospital (103 children < 18 years, 51 adults 18-59 years, 458 seniors > 59 years). Children and adults with underlying chronic cardiovascular, neurological, immunological, or lower respiratory diseases had a higher risk of dying than those without (Odds Ratio 109, 58, 28, 6 in children, and 3, 3, 3, 2 in adults). In seniors, the risk was increased for patients with chronic neurological conditions (OR 1.3) but not for other underlying conditions. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and pneumonia increased the risk of a fatal outcome in all age groups. CONCLUSION: In-hospital fatality of RSV-coded patients varied considerably with age, chronic conditions and complications. Seniors were the most affected age group and may therefore benefit from the RSV vaccination recommended in Germany since 2024 for all over 75 years and seniors with pre-existing conditions."
15620165,[Intestinal transplantation in adults: present situation and future prospects].,2004,"Intestinal transplantation is becoming more firmly established as a treatment for intestinal failure in patients whose home parenteral nutrition regimens have caused serious side effects. Outcomes have improved spectacularly over recent years thanks to the refinement of surgical techniques and the introduction of new immunosuppressants, and also to greater experience in anesthetic and postoperative management of intestinal transplant patients. The main causes of high morbidity and mortality continue to be sepsis and acute rejection of the graft. Both graft and patient survival have improved with the advent of the immunosuppressant regimens based on Tacrolimus, although survival rates are still far below those reported for other solid organ transplants. The first intestinal transplant performed in Spain took place in July 2002 in our hospital and the results were promising. Given this new challenge for anesthesiologists, we decided to review current trends in the perioperative management of patients receiving isolated intestinal transplants, the main complications that arise, treatment strategies, and future prospects."
32648533,"Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy: a systematic review of the aetiology, timing, and reported adverse perinatal risks during pregnancy.",2020,"We performed a comprehensive systematic review of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy using PubMed, SCOPUS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Ovid from inception to April 2018. About 7796 references were screened for inclusion, and 52 references from 1908 to 2017 were included. One hundred seven cases of acute pyelonephritis in pregnant women were reviewed. Gestational age at diagnosis was reported as 2 (2%), 43 (40%), and 51 (52%) during the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Maternal complications included sepsis (49%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (47%), anaemia (33%), acute kidney injury (10%), renal abscess (6%), and death (6%). 25 preterm deliveries (23%), 6 intrauterine foetal demises (6%), 4 spontaneous abortions (4%), and 8 neonatal intensive care unit admissions (7%) were reported. Microorganisms cultured included Escherichia coli (51%), Klebsiella (8%), Proteus (5%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus (4%), and Enterococcus (3%). Early diagnosis and management led to fewer complications.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and in this article, we highlight the most common outcomes previously reported. Previous studies have reported maternal adverse outcomes and only very few stressed on fetal/neonatal outcomes.What do the results of this study add? The results add that not only is maternal morbidity/mortality is increased, but also increases adverse outcomes for the fetus/neonate, such as preterm delivery and fetal/neonatal demise.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The implications from this article serve to increase a medical providers knowledge on how to appropriately counsel pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis. In addition, future research can aim to understand why pregnant women are more prone to morbidity and mortality compared to nonpregnant women."
31868292,Cerebral atrophy in 21 hypotonic infants with severe vitamin B12 deficiency.,2020,"AIM: Nutritional B12 deficiency is a treatable cause of neurodevelopmental delay in infants. We report 21 infants with developmental regression and brain atrophy as revealed using cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), secondary to severe vitamin B12 deficiency. METHODS: Twenty-one infants aged 4-24 months with B12 deficiencies who were admitted to our clinic between May 2013 and May 2018 were included in the study. MRI, bone marrow aspiration and the Denver-II Developmental Screening Test were performed in all infants. RESULTS: The mean age of the infants was 12.3 months, and the mean B12 level was 70.15 +/- 32.15 ng/L. Hypotonia and neurodevelopmental retardation, and anaemia were present in all patients. Their bone marrow examinations were compatible with megaloblastic anaemia. Twelve patients had microcephaly, seven had tremor and one patient died of severe sepsis. Almost all patients were fed with breast milk and their mothers were also malnourished. Nine (42.9%) of the patients were Turkish and 12 (57.1%) were Syrian. All patients had abnormal Denver-II Developmental Screening Test scores. Most patients had severe cortical atrophy, cerebral effusion, thinning of the corpus callosum and delayed myelinisation in cranial MRI. Treatment with B12 resulted in dramatic improvement in general activity and appetite within 72 h. Tremors resolved in all cases. CONCLUSION: Neurological findings and developmental delay related to nutritional B12 deficiency can be prevented without sequelae if diagnosed early. Screening and treating of mothers for this deficiency will contribute to the health of both the mother and their feeding infant."
41458684,Percutaneous Nephrostomy and Ureteroscopic Management of Bilateral Renal Papillary Necrosis in an Elderly Female.,2025,"Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) is a rare but clinically significant cause of obstructive uropathy, often associated with infection, diabetes mellitus, analgesic abuse, or systemic vascular comorbidities. Timely diagnosis and intervention are essential to prevent irreversible renal injury and sepsis. An 84-year-old female with multiple chronic comorbidities, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and long-term anticoagulation therapy, presented with acute severe left-sided loin pain, fever, and vomiting. Imaging revealed bilateral hyperdense lesions at the ureteropelvic junctions, initially mimicking calculi. Flexible ureteroscopy later confirmed sloughed necrotic papillae, consistent with bilateral RPN. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous nephrostomy for decompression, followed by definitive ureteroscopic retrieval of necrotic tissue. Histopathology demonstrated fibrosis, tubular epithelial erosion, and ischemic necrosis without evidence of malignancy. The patient showed marked clinical improvement, normalization of renal function, and complete radiological resolution at one-month follow-up. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, prompt decompression, and coordinated multidisciplinary management in obstructive RPN. A structured diagnostic and therapeutic approach can lead to full functional recovery even in elderly patients with complex comorbidities."
31852491,Right Dose Right Now: bedside data-driven personalized antibiotic dosing in severe sepsis and septic shock - rationale and design of a multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic exposure is often inadequate in critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and this is associated with worse outcomes. Despite markedly altered and rapidly changing pharmacokinetics in these patients, guidelines and clinicians continue to rely on standard dosing schemes. To address this challenge, we developed AutoKinetics, a clinical decision support system for antibiotic dosing. By feeding large amounts of electronic health record patient data into pharmacokinetic models, patient-specific predicted future plasma concentrations are displayed graphically. In addition, a tailored dosing advice is provided at the bedside in real time. To evaluate the effect of AutoKinetics on pharmacometric and clinical endpoints, we are conducting the Right Dose Right Now multicenter, randomized controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, non-blinded, superiority trial. METHODS: All adult intensive care patients with a suspected or proven infection and having either lactatemia or receiving vasopressor support are eligible for inclusion. Randomization to the AutoKinetics or control group is initiated at the bedside when prescribing at least one of four commonly administered antibiotics: ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, meropenem and vancomycin. Dosing advice is available for patients in the AutoKinetics group, whereas patients in the control group receive standard dosing. The primary outcome of the study is pharmacometric target attainment during the first 24 h. Power analysis revealed the need for inclusion of 42 patients per group per antibiotic. Thus, a total of 336 patients will be included, 168 in each group. Secondary pharmacometric endpoints include time to target attainment and fraction of target attainment during an entire antibiotic course. Secondary clinical endpoints include mortality, clinical cure and days free from organ support. Several other exploratory and subgroup analyses are planned. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of bedside data-driven automated antibiotic dosing advice. This is important as adequate antibiotic exposure may be crucial to treat severe sepsis and septic shock. In addition, the trial could prove to be a significant contribution to clinical pharmacometrics and serve as a stepping stone for the use of big data and artificial intelligence in the field.

20034694,Hepatitis C virus viremia and low platelet count: a study in a hepatitis B & C endemic area in Taiwan.,2010,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been shown to be associated with a low platelet count. This study aimed to elucidate the association between virologic status and platelet count in individuals with HCV infection. METHODS: A large-scale survey, enrolling 11,239 residents, was conducted in the Kaohsiung area of Taiwan. Serum HCV RNA and non-invasive markers of fibrosis (FibroTest) were tested for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV)-positive subjects. The platelet counts of age- and sex-matched, biopsy-proven, hospital-based patients and community-based patients with minimal fibrosis were compared. RESULTS: Anti-HCV was positive in 703 (6.2%) subjects and was significantly associated with older age, female sex, abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value and low platelet count (<150,000/microl). The independent factors significantly associated with low platelet count were abnormal ALT value (odds ratio [OR]: 3.70, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.18-6.28) and positive HCV RNA (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.01-3.97). After adjustment for the fibrosis, HCV RNA remained significantly associated with platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results evaluating the association between platelet count and HCV viremia and taking the influences of fibrosis into consideration implicate that platelets may be affected directly by HCV."
41669529,Intestinal microenvironment dynamics and Sepsis-associated encephalopathy pathophysiology: insights from multi-omics profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a devastating complication of sepsis, lacks specific biomarkers and clear pathophysiological understanding, particularly regarding the gut-brain axis. While gut dysbiosis is implicated in SAE, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (16S rDNA and fecal miRNA sequencing) to dissect the gut microenvironment in SAE patients (n = 10) compared to sepsis patients without encephalopathy (SP, n = 20). RESULTS: Although alpha- and beta-diversity indices showed no significant differences, distinct compositional shifts in the gut microbiota were observed in SAE patients, characterized by increased abundance of Neisseria, Haemophilus, Lautropia, Enterococcus, Parabacteroides, and decreased Fusobacterium, Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, among others. Concurrently, 12 fecal miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in SAE, with 11 upregulated (e.g., miR-106a-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-30e-3p) and 1 downregulated (miR-222-3p). Crucially, correlation network analysis revealed significant interactions between 10 DE miRNAs and 15 bacterial genera, establishing a complex gut microbiota-miRNA interplay in SAE. Machine learning (LASSO and elastic net regression) identified miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as the most promising combined diagnostic biomarkers, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893. Functional exploration via ceRNA network analysis indicated miR-30e-3p targets inflammation and apoptosis-related genes (e.g., IL1B, RPS6KB1, AKT1), while miR-223-5p primarily targets immune-regulatory genes (e.g., IGF1, AR). Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated serum IL-1beta levels in SAE patients (p < 0.001), supporting the predicted inflammatory pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of a fecal miRNA-gut microbiota interaction network in SAE pathogenesis, highlighting miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as pivotal mediators and potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets."
25524883,Pharmaconutrition with selenium in critically ill patients: what do we know?,2015,"Selenium is a component of selenoproteins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), and multiorgan failure (MOF) are associated with an early reduction in plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), and both parameters correlate inversely with the severity of illness and outcomes. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluated selenium therapy as monotherapy or in antioxidant cocktails in intensive care unit (ICU) patient populations, and more recently several meta-analyses suggested benefits with selenium therapy in the most seriously ill patients. However, the largest RCT on pharmaconutrition with glutamine and antioxidants, the REducing Deaths due to Oxidative Stress (REDOXS) Study, was unable to find any improvement in clinical outcomes with antioxidants provided by the enteral and parenteral route and suggested harm in patients with renal dysfunction. Subsequently, the MetaPlus study demonstrated increased mortality in medical patients when provided extra glutamine and selenium enterally. The treatment effect of selenium may be dependent on the dose, the route of administration, and whether administered with other nutrients and the patient population studied. Currently, there are few small studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) selenium in SIRS, and therefore more data are necessary, particularly in patients with MOD, including those with renal dysfunction. According to current knowledge, high-dose pentahydrate sodium selenite could be given as an IV bolus injection (1000-2000 microg), which causes transient pro-oxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and then followed by a continuous infusion of 1000-1600 microg/d for up to 10-14 days. Nonetheless, the optimum dose and efficacy still remain controversial and need to be definitively established."
41442288,Tailored to Fit Sepsis Individuals: Medical Knowledge Aware Reinforcement Learning Model Offers Optimized Therapeutic Strategies.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, with high morbidity and mortality. Timely treatments and precise interventions are crucial for improving sepsis patient outcomes. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have made promising advances in associating sepsis treatments. However, existing models face obstacles when applied to heterogeneous sepsis patients with an imbalanced distribution of disease severity, struggling to maintain optimal performance. To provide optimal therapeutic intervention strategies for sepsis with different disease severity, we proposed a novel treatment recommendation model named Medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis Position aware Transfer learning - Double Dueling Deep Q Network (MPT-D3QN). Through the attention mechanism, medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis positions were introduced to achieve a more accurate representation of patient states. Subsequently, an offline deep reinforcement learning algorithm was used to recommend therapeutic intervention strategies for a specific patient population. The transfer learning framework was responsible for the information transfer across patient groups in different domains. We trained and tested MPT-D3QN model on the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Compared with the reported strategies in present clinical practice, the MPT-D3QN model could obtain a higher expected return value (12.98 vs. 10.61) and reduce the estimated mortality from 13.20% to 6.15% in all test datasets. Moreover, the experimental test on an external dataset eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) further demonstrated the robust generalization capability of the model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed model not only guaranteed higher expected returns but also generated optimal and interpretable treatment strategies for sepsis with different disease severity."
25516859,Large bowel injuries during gynecological laparoscopy.,2014,"Laparoscopy is one of the most frequently preferred surgical options in gynecological surgery and has advantages over laparotomy, including smaller surgical scars, faster recovery, less pain and earlier return of bowel functions. Generally, it is also accepted as safe and effective and patients tolerate it well. However, it is still an intra-abdominal procedure and has the similar potential risks of laparotomy, including injury of a vital structure, bleeding and infection. Besides the well-known risks of open surgery, laparoscopy also has its own unique risks related to abdominal access methods, pneumoperitoneum created to provide adequate operative space and the energy modalities used during the procedures. Bowel, bladder or major blood vessel injuries and passage of gas into the intravascular space may result from laparoscopic surgical technique. In addition, the risks of aspiration, respiratory dysfunction and cardiovascular dysfunction increase during laparoscopy. Large bowel injuries during laparoscopy are serious complications because 50% of bowel injuries and 60% of visceral injuries are undiagnosed at the time of primary surgery. A missed or delayed diagnosis increases the risk of bowel perforation and consequently sepsis and even death. In this paper, we aim to focus on large bowel injuries that happen during gynecological laparoscopy and review their diagnostic and management options."
20009668,Fluid replacement with hypertonic or isotonic solutions guided by mixed venous oxygen saturation in experimental hypodynamic sepsis.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Splanchnic perfusion is prone to early injury and persists despite normalization of global hemodynamic variables in sepsis. Volume replacement guided by oxygen derived variables has been recommended in the management of septic patients. Our hypothesis was that a hypertonic isoncotic solution would improve the benefits of crystalloids replacement guided by mixed venous oxygen saturation. METHODS: Seventeen anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs received an intravenous infusion of live E. coli in 30 minutes. They were then randomized into three groups: control group (n = 3) bacterial infusion without treatment; normal saline (n = 7), initial fluid replacement with 32 mL/kg of normal saline during 20 minutes; hypertonic solution (n = 7), initial fluid replacement with 4 mL/kg of hypertonic solution during 5 minutes. After 30 and 60 minutes, additional boluses of normal saline were administered when mixed venous oxygen saturation remained below 70%. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output; regional blood flows, systemic and regional oxygen-derived variables, and lactate levels were assessed. Animals were observed for 90 minutes and then killed. Hystopathological analysis including apoptosis detection using terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling was performed. RESULTS: A hypodynamic septic shock was observed after bacterial infusion. Both the fluid-treated groups presented similar transient benefits in systemic and regional variables. A greater degree of gut epithelial cells apoptosis was observed in normal saline-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Although normalization of mixed venous oxygen saturation was not associated with restoration of markers of splanchnic or other systemic perfusion variables, the initial fluid savings with hypertonic saline and its latter effect on gut apoptosis may be of interest in sepsis management."
32087076,Usefulness of presepsin as diagnostic and prognostic marker of sepsis in daily clinical practice.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment have a crucial influence on survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of presepsin (sCD14) in patients with sepsis. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-four consecutive adult patients with sepsis and 26 patients with aseptic meningitis as a control group were included in this prospective observational study. In all patients included in the study, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), presepsin, lactate, and a count of leukocytes and neutrophils were determined on admission. In those with suspected bacterial infection, two separate blood cultures were obtained and procalcitonin (PCT) concentration was detected. Plasma presepsin and PCT concentrations in septic group patients were followed on days 2, 3 and 7 after enrollment. RESULTS: The median presepsin serum concentration in patients with sepsis was 1614 pg/mL and in the control group it was 203 pg/mL (p < 0.001). Presepsin levels in patients with septic shock were higher than in sepsis patients (p < 0.014). The mean presepsin concentrations were higher in deceased than in surviving patients (p = 0.009). The trend of changes in presepsin concentrations in deceased patients was significantly different than in the surviving patients (p = 0.018). There were no statistically significant differences in the concentration of presepsin or other biomarkers in patients with Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin may be used as a diagnostic marker of systemic bacterial infection and can predict the severity and outcome of sepsis."
41477560,Neonatal Sepsis in Dogs Caused by Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus Sourced From Maternal Mastitis-Case Report.,2025,"Bacterial infections are common during the neonatal period, and sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality in dogs in the first 21 days. Maternal clinical and subclinical mastitis is one of the main sources of neonatal infection, leading to the ingestion of milk with bacteria and bacterial toxins, known as toxic milk syndrome. The objective of this report was to describe a case of neonatal sepsis in puppies secondary to maternal clinical mastitis, as well as its diagnosis and treatment. Three 5-day-old Pug dogs presented signs of neonatal infection: diarrhea, body erythema, and omphalitis. The bitch had purulent content in all of her breasts. Leukopenia due to neutropenia and monocytosis was observed in the puppies' blood count. The milk microbiological culture revealed beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, which was sensitive to antibiotics from the cephalosporin and penicillin classes according to the antibiogram. The puppies were separated from their mother, fed with breast milk substitute, and treated with ceftriaxone. The mother was treated with amoxicillin with potassium clavulanate. Neonatal and maternal infections were responsive to the antibiotics used, demonstrating the absence of signs of infection and blood counts without changes after 7 days of treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment were essential for the survival of the litter."
15738594,[Wilms' tumour of unfavorable histology--results of treatment with the SIOP 93-01 protocol at the Gdansk centre. Preliminary report].,2004,"BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumour is the most common primary renal tumour of childhood. The aim or the study was to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with unfavourable histology Wilms' tumour. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 44 children were treated for nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour) according to the SIOP 93-01 protocol in the Department of Paediatrics. Haematology. Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, between 1993 and 2002. Eleven children were classified as having tumours with high-grade malignancy. Among these 2 cases of nephroblastoma with diffuse anaplasia, 6 with sarcomatous stroma and 2 cases with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney were diagnosed. In one patient file tumour structure was undefined due to complete necrosis of the tumour tissue. The staging stratification was as follows: stage I-l, II N (-)-l, II N (+) -3, III- 6, including a neoplasmic occluding thrombus in the inferior vena cava, IV - 0, V-0. All children were treated according to the SIOP 93-01 protocol. RESULTS: complete remission was achieved in 9 patients. Two children died. Fatal outcome was attributed in one case to cancer progression (primary resistance to chemotherapy after 14 months of treatment) and in the other, to the treatment complications (fungal sepsis after undergoing the third course of chemotherapy Carbo+ VP-16). In the analysed group there were no patients with stage IV disease, no relapses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: our observations support the opinion, that high-grade malignancy histology is the basic unfavourable prognostic factor in nephroblastoma."
15717579,Clinical profile and outcome of acute renal failure in South Indian children.,2004,"This was a retrospective study to assess the clinical profile of children admitted with acute renal failure and to identify factors associated with poor outcome. Fifty-four children (age one month to 12 years) with acute renal failure were studied. Males outnumbered females (38/54; 70%). The leading precipitating causes for renal failure were acute gastro-enteritis (85%), underlying renal pathology (43%), proven sepsis (22%) and suspected sepsis (22%). The main presenting complaints were diarrhoea (86%),oliguria (72%), rapid respiration (37%), oedema (37%), vomiting (19%) and seizures (13%). All patients underwent standard investigations and treatment. Forty-eight per cent of patients required peritoneal dialysis and 15% required ventilation. The overall mortality was 52%. Underlying renal pathology and sepsis both contributed to the high morbidity and mortality. Mortality due to sepsis was 83%; it was 65% in dialysed patients and 100% in those requiring ventilatory support. Biochemical profile of the above patients showed that hyperkalaemia was significantly associated with high mortality (83%) as against 75% in those with hypokalaemia and 33% with normal levels (p<0.001). Patients with hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia similarly had an adverse outcome. Acidosis, seen in 20 patients, had a mortality of 45%. The outcome was poorer in those with high creatinine levels (63%)."
41467150,Bilateral Adrenal Hemorrhage and Acute Adrenal Insufficiency Secondary to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Adrenal insufficiency (AI) secondary to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is rare; only 3 instances of such cases were reported after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). We report a case of AI due to BAH from HIT after an elective CABG. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease underwent CABG a week ago presented with abdominal pain. Labs showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap, and positive serum ketones. Intravenous insulin with empirical antibiotics was started. Platelet decline was noticed from 154 000/uL to 39 000/uL on the following days, along with fever, hypotension, altered mentation, hyponatremia, and abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed BAH. Primary AI was confirmed with a cosyntropin stimulation test, and HIT was diagnosed with Heparin-PF4 IgG assay and serotonin release assay. His symptoms improved after hydrocortisone treatment. DISCUSSION: AI secondary to BAH from HIT is a rare complication, with most cases reported after orthopedic surgeries. Symptoms of AI are vague and similar to sepsis. If hyponatremia, and gastrointestinal symptoms are noticed, adrenal insufficiency should be suspected, and early stress dose steroid treatment should be considered. Steroid treatment in such cases has shown to improve survival. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and could be similar to sepsis. Electrolyte abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms could be hints for adrenal insufficiency, especially if risks for adrenal hemorrhage are present. Early stress dose treatment in such cases has shown a survival benefit."
28979375,"Raised cardiac troponin in intensive care patients with sepsis, in the absence of angiographically documented coronary artery disease: A systematic review.",2015,"Elevated cardiac troponin in the critically ill has been associated with increased hospital mortality. However, in critically ill patients with sepsis the results are heterogeneous and less easy to interpret. The objectives of this systematic review were to describe the pathophysiology, clinical relevance and prognostic significance of raised troponin in intensive care patients with sepsis. Articles were identified through a detailed MEDLINE search and additional references were retrieved from the selected studies. A growing body of clinical evidence suggests that although troponins are sensitive biomarkers with prognostic value, they are not independent predictors of mortality. However, vigilance for objective evidence of coronary artery disease is required and patients with atherosclerotic risk factors and elevated troponins may benefit from cardiac imaging. In patients with low pre-test probability for coronary artery disease and elevated troponins, therapy should target management of sepsis and optimisation of myocardial oxygen demand/supply balance."
20006419,Opportunities for Emergency Medical Services care of sepsis.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems play key roles in the rapid identification and treatment of critical illness such as trauma, myocardial infarction and stroke. EMS often provides care for sepsis, a life-threatening sequelae of infection. In this study of Emergency Department patients admitted to the hospital with an infection, we characterized the patients receiving initial care by EMS. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with suspected infection presenting to a 50,000 visit urban, academic ED from September 16, 2005-September 30, 2006. We included patients who had abnormal ED vital signs or required hospital admission. We identified patients that received EMS care. Between EMS and non-EMS patients, we compared patient age, sex, nursing home residency, vital signs, comorbidities, source of infection, organ dysfunction, sepsis severity and mortality. We analyzed the data using univariate odds ratios, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 4613 ED patients presenting with serious infections, 1576 (34.2%) received initial EMS care. The mortality rate among those transported by EMS was 126/1576 (8.0%) compared to 67/3037 (2.2%) in those who were not. Adjusted mortality was higher for EMS (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.6). Of patients who qualified for protocolized sepsis care in the ED, 99/162 (61.1%) were transported via EMS. EMS patients were more likely to present with severe sepsis (OR 3.9; 3.4-4.5) or septic shock (OR 3.6; 2.6-5.0). EMS patients had higher sepsis acuity (mortality in ED sepsis score 6 vs. 3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EMS provides initial care for over one-third of ED infection patients, including the majority of patients with severe sepsis, septic shock, and those who ultimately die. EMS systems may offer important opportunities for advancing sepsis diagnosis and care."
41431092,Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia in an AIDS patient during pregnancy: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Pregnancy complicated by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can result in a dual state of immune suppression, significantly increasing susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), a placenta-tropic lethal pathogen, is extremely rare in pregnant women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, when it does occur, it often leads to maternal sepsis, premature birth, or fetal death. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 36+(2)-week pregnant woman who presented with a 4-day history of persistent fever and was known to be HIV-positive. Laboratory tests indicated an elevated neutrophil percentage and an increased C-reactive protein level. Imaging studies revealed bilateral renal hydronephrosis. Blood culture confirmed a L. monocytogenes infection, identified with 99% confidence by Vitek2. DIAGNOSIS: When pregnant women who are HIV-positive experience unexplained fever, there should be a heightened alert for potential opportunistic infections, such as Listeria. It is recommended that blood cultures and molecular testing be conducted within 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Due to the patient's allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, a breakthrough treatment regimen consisting of linezolid combined with imipenem and cilastatin was selected. OUTCOMES: After 3 days of treatment, the patient's temperature returned to normal, and both the mother and the infant were discharged in good health. LESSONS: HIV infection during pregnancy, when complicated by L. monocytogenes bacteremia, is extremely rare; however, it carries a very high mortality rate. This case study represents one of the few documented instances of HIV infection complicated by L. monocytogenes bacteremia during pregnancy. It underscores the necessity for clinicians to enhance early detection and implement precise interventions for these rare co-infections to optimize maternal and infant outcomes."
16117960,Evaluation of a new Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase assay (OptiMAL-IT) for the detection of malaria.,2003,"The new OptiMAL-IT(R) rapid diagnostic test for malaria was evaluated in 271 patients in Thailand with uncomplicated malaria between June and July 2002. The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum parasites were 88% and 92%, respectively. For species other than P. falciparum, the sensitivity was 65% and specificity was 99%. The performance of the new test decreased markedly at low levels of parasitaemia."
25570825,Computing network-based features from physiological time series: application to sepsis detection.,2014,"Sepsis is a systemic deleterious host response to infection. It is a major healthcare problem that affects millions of patients every year in the intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Despite the fact that ICU patients are heavily instrumented with physiological sensors, early sepsis detection remains challenging, perhaps because clinicians identify sepsis by using static scores derived from bed-side measurements individually, i.e., without systematically accounting for potential interactions between these signals and their dynamics. In this study, we apply network-based data analysis to take into account interactions between bed-side physiological time series (PTS) data collected in ICU patients, and we investigate features to distinguish between sepsis and non-sepsis conditions. We treated each PTS source as a node on a graph and we retrieved the graph connectivity matrix over time by tracking the correlation between each pair of sources' signals over consecutive time windows. Then, for each connectivity matrix, we computed the eigenvalue decomposition. We found that, even though raw PTS measurements may have indistinguishable distributions in non-sepsis and early sepsis states, the median /I of the eigenvalues computed from the same data is statistically different (p <; 0.001) in the two states and the evolution of /I may reflect the disease progression. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that network-based features computed from continuous PTS data may be useful for early sepsis detection."
41430511,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill adult patients admitted with traumatic brain injury: a cohort study.,2025,"PURPOSE: We sought to describe the clinical features and outcomes of adult patients with traumatic brain injury in Ontario. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (April 2009 to March 2021) with a first episode of traumatic brain injury. To compare the long-term outcome trajectory after traumatic brain injury, we matched patients with traumatic brain injury 1:1 to patients who survived an intensive care unit admission with multisystem trauma but without traumatic brain injury. We measured in-hospital and long-term all-cause mortality; additional endpoints included 1) new psychiatric diagnosis, 2) epilepsy, 3) venous thromboembolic disease, and 4) sepsis. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Overall, we included 13,283 adult patients with traumatic brain injury. The mean age was 54 yr; 72% of patients were male. The most common pre-existing comorbidities were hypertension (39%) and cardiovascular disease (19%). Median follow-up was 5 years; 17% of patients with traumatic brain injury died during their initial hospital stay, and 16% died during long-term follow-up. Sepsis after hospital discharge occurred in 14% of patients; additional outcomes included new psychiatric diagnosis (7%), epilepsy (4%), and venous thromboembolic disease (2%). Surviving traumatic brain injury was associated with a higher hazard of epilepsy (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.99 to 2.95); the risk of other outcomes was similar or lower when compared with survivors without traumatic brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with traumatic brain injury have a high risk of in-hospital death. Those who survive the initial hospitalization are at risk of long-term outcomes including new epilepsy."

The patient was treated successfully with oral linezolid. Early diagnosis of the microbial etiology of purpura fulminans is important. If Enterococcus faecalis is found as the causal organism, appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be used."
15756804,[New biochemical markers in the assessment of minor myocardial damage in critically ill patients].,2004,"The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina is based on typical clinical signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and serial measurements of characteristic serum enzymes, especially troponins. Today, newer biochemical markers are used in assessing these conditions, as well as minor myocardial damage (MMD). AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the existence of MMD by the analysis of new biochemical markers including cardiac troponin T (c-TnT), troponin I (c-TnI), CK-MB activity (CK-MBact), CK-MB mass (CK-MBmass), a conventional marker of total creatine kinase (CK), and 12-lead ECG monitoring in two groups of critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Group 1 (n=52) consisted of the patients with heart failure, unexplainable hypotension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in acute exacerbation, acute severe pancreatitis, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, diabetes with complications, liver cirrhosis, and tachycardia >120/min who suffered chest discomfort without evident ECG signs of AMI. Group 2 consisted of patients (n=73) with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, poisoning, and miscellaneous conditions without chest discomfort or ECG signs of AMI. RESULTS: Of the 52 critically ill patients, 21.2% were positive for troponin T and 11.5% for troponin I. Group 1 patients showed a prevalence of elevated total CK (28.8%), CK-MBact (7.7%), and CK-MBmass (32.7%). In group 2, positive troponin I was found in 19.7% of patients, troponin T was negative (0.00%), with elevated total CK (23.9%), CKMBact (7.0%), and CK-MBmass (2.3%). The mean concentrations of c-TnT, c-TnI, total CK, CK-MBact, CK-MBmass were higher in group 1 than in group 2, however, without statistical significance. The best positive correlation was recorded between CK-MBact and CK-MBmass (r=0.63). The c-TnI showed best discrimination and accuracy in the assessment of MMD under the ROC curves surface (0.84), while the accuracy was low for all other markers analyzed. Discrimination and accuracy were moderate for all markers analyzed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CK-MBact (92.3%) showed the highest specificity, followed by c-TnI (88.5%) and c-TnT (75.6%). The sensitivity was low for all markers analyzed. Concerning specificity, CK-MBact proved to be the best biologic marker for the assessment of MMD, followed by c-TnI and c-TnT. Correct clinical assessment according to marker accuracy and discrimination can be achieved by use of c-TnI, however, with a moderate degree of accuracy and discrimination for the detection of MMD in critically ill patients admitted to ICU."

31866336,Label-free serum detection of Trichinella spiralis using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis.,2020,"Based on blood serum surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis, this paper proposed a simple and unlabeled non-invasive serum detection for T. spiralis infection. Serum samples were collected and analyzed from 40 rats at 0 days post infection (dpi) (normal rats), 19 uninfected rats, and 16 rats infected with T. spiralis at 28 dpi, using SERS measurements. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal components analysis (PCA), were used to analyze and identify the obtained blood serum SERS spectra. The diagnosis algorithms, based on PCA-LDA, achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 94.7%, and an accuracy of 91.4% for separating the samples infected with T. spiralis from the control samples. This exploratory study demonstrated that colloidal Ag NPs-based SERS serum analysis technique combined with PCA-LDA has a great potential in improving the detection of T. spiralis infection and onsite screening."
41651591,"Defining Sepsis: Past, Present, and Future.",2026,"A common definition of sepsis is necessary to identify patients with sepsis in clinical practice, to enroll patients into prospective research studies, and to conduct surveillance and retrospective research. However, defining sepsis has proven challenging. Sepsis has generally been conceptualized as an injurious host response to infection. Modern definitions have evolved from defining this injurious host response as a systemic inflammatory response to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. While current sepsis definitions have several limitations, including the lack of a gold standard and tremendous heterogeneity of presentations, ongoing research offers promise to improve sepsis diagnosis and future definitions."
15590803,A dual expandable nitinol stent: experience in 102 patients with malignant gastroduodenal strictures.,2004,"PURPOSE: To investigate the technical feasibility and clinical effectiveness of a dual expandable nitinol stent in the palliative treatment of malignant gastroduodenal strictures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dual stent consisted of two stents, an outer partially covered stent and an inner bare nitinol stent. The outer diameter of the stent delivery system was 3.8 mm. With fluoroscopic guidance, the outer stent was placed into the stricture, followed by coaxial placement of the inner stent. The stent placement was attempted in 102 consecutive patients with malignant gastroduodenal strictures. The underlying causes of malignant strictures were gastric cancer (n = 55), pancreatic cancer (n = 24), gallbladder cancer (n = 7), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5), duodenal cancer (n = 5), and metastatic cancer (n = 6). All patients presented with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful and well tolerated in 101 of 102 patients (99%). After stent placement, 85 of the 101 patients (84%) with technical success experienced improvement of their symptoms. Tumor overgrowth occurred in five patients, stent migration in two, mucosal hyperplasia in one, bleeding in one, and jaundice in two. Seventy one of the 101 patients died 5 to 340 days (mean, 71 days) after stent placement from progression of their disease, myocardial infarction, bleeding, or sepsis. The remaining 30 patients are still alive 6 to 227 days (mean, 39 days) after stent placement. The 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 180-day survival rates were 78%, 58%, 39%, and 8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The dual stent with a 3.8-mm stent delivery system is easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for the palliative treatment of malignant gastroduodenal strictures."
41416145,"[Molecular Epidemiology and Fluconazole Resistance Mechanisms in Candida tropicalis Isolates From Bloodstream Infections in Sichuan, China].",2025,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) isolates from bloodstream infections, and to investigate preliminarily the underlying mechanisms of fluconazole resistance. METHODS: Clinical C. tropicalis isolates were collected from bloodstream infections at West China Hospital, Sichuan University and other hospitals in Sichuan Province. All the collected isolates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the antifungal susceptibility test was performed by the broth microdilution method. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was conducted using the first generation sequencing technique. Genes associated with drug-resistance were sequenced and the mutation sites were identified. The relative expression levels of genes associated with drug-resistance were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 39 C. tropicalis isolates from bloodstream infections were collected. The MLST phylogenetic tree showed that most of the strains clustered in the phylogenetic tree shared identical or similar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). All MLST types were not matched with the isolates in the PubMLST database, representing new diploid sequence types (DSTs). A total of 3 sense mutations, including Ser154Phe, Tyr132Phe, and Tyr257His were identified in ERG11, and were present only in drug-resistant strains. UPC2 contained 4 sense mutations, including Ala251Thr, Gln289Leu, Ser279Glu, and Gln313His, which were also present only in drug-resistant strains. Ser279Glu and Gln313His were previously unreported. There were two sense mutations in ERG3, namely Ser112Gly and Ala48Ser, both being previously unreported, and Ser112Gly was found only in drug-resistant strains. The expression levels of ERG11 (14.48 vs 7.109, P = 0.003) and UPC2 (1.922 vs 0.832, P = 0.04) in non-sensitive group (MIC > 2 mg/L) were higher than those in sensitive group (MIC </= 2 mg/L), and the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There may be a unique genetic relationship among C. tropicalis isolates from Sichuan province, and the MICs of fluconazole against C. tropicalis are associated with molecular typing. ERG11 mutations were the major mechanism underlying fluconazole resistance in C. tropicalis isolates. The upregulation of ERG11 and UPC2 was associated with fluconazole resistance in C. tropicalis."
41400206,Sepsis and mucositis-related biomarkers in adult hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia.,2025,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of chemotherapy and potentially fatal. It is often associated with mucositis. Timely recognition of complications enables early supportive treatment and potentially reduces mortality. Common diagnostic parameters are often nonspecific or have slow kinetics. This study examines the applicability of mucosa-related biomarkers in the recognition of complicated course among 78 adult hematologic patients with FN after intensive chemotherapy. Plasma concentrations of citrulline, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)AGP), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were measured at the onset of fever and the following two days. All except ZO-1 showed a significant trend. Concentrations of CRP, PCT, citrulline and alpha(1)AGP were higher with a complicated course. Patients with severe sepsis had higher levels of PCT and lower levels of I-FABP. In conclusion, measurement of mucosa-related biomarkers might help predict the course of FN."
15700845,"Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies: clinical and microbiological retrospective comparative analysis of S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and S. aureus.",2004,"Although Staphylococcus haemolyticus (SH) represents an emerging etiology of methicillin-resistant (MR) coagulase-negative staphylococcal nosocomial bacteremia, little is known of clinical significance of this infection. Thus, we performed case-control retrospective comparative analysis of MRSH bacteremias (MRSHB), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis bacteremias (MRSEB), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremias (MRSAB) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Most patients in the three groups were neutropenic and had a central venous catheter (CVC) in place at the onset of bacteremia. However, MRSHB patients had a CVC in place prior to bacteremia for a time significantly more prolonged than MRSEB and MRSAB ones (p<0.05). Severe sepsis or septic shock were more common in patients with MRSAB as compared with MRSHB (p=0.02). Nosocomial attributable mortality rate was very low in the 3 study groups (0 to 5.4%) and only two patients developed metastatic infections. Overall, reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin was observed in 19 (47.5%) MRSH and in 4 (10%) MRSE isolates. Resistance to teicoplanin was observed in 6 isolates, all MRSH. Reduced susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin was observed in 2 isolates, both MRSH. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to the glycopeptides. Comparison between cases of bacteremia in patients with MRSH isolates with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin and those with susceptible MRSH did not reveal significant differences in the clinical-microbiological response to teicoplanin therapy and outcome. Our results seem to suggest that MRSHB in hematologic patients is associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. MRSH frequently shows a reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin; however these in vitro data do not seem associated with an unfavorable clinical response to teicoplanin therapy for MRSHB in patients with hematologic malignancies."
15794413,Toll-like receptors: dysregulation in vivo in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the time course of the expression of five toll-like receptors (TLRs 1-5) in mixed blood mononuclear cells and their relationship to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective, a longitudinal study was done at an intensive-care unit of a university-affiliated hospital. Seven consecutive patients with ARDS were studied. We followed the onset and progression of ARDS, and subsequent patient recovery or death, and compared patient data with data from a group of healthy volunteers. We separated mixed blood mononuclear cells using Ficoll-Hypaque to detect the transcripts of human TLRs 1-5. TLR mRNAs were isolated by semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Each signal was expressed as the ratio of TLR mRNA to beta-actin. Cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukins 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, were assayed using commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: Dysregulation in the transcription of TLRs gene, principally in ARDS surviving patients, was observed. Down-regulated expressions of TLR1, TLR4, and TLR5 mRNAs were observed in the first 24 h in patients who survived, and probably played a key role in the survival of patients with ARDS caused by sepsis. Serum levels of cytokines such as IL-6, 8 and 10 were significantly increased in patients with ARDS as compared with levels in the healthy volunteers. However, serum levels of IL-12 were lower in patients with ARDS than in the healthy volunteers. There was difference in serum cytokines concentration between survivors and non-survivors patients with ARDS (except for interleukin-10). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, TLRs gene dysregulation and cytokine profiles are probably important prognostic factors for patient outcome and survival after ARDS."
20491388,[Disseminated BCG infection in patients with urinary bladder carcinoma].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin--a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis has been used in immunotherapy of patients with superficial urinary bladder carcinoma. Some patients develop complications after intravesical instillation of BCG: high temperature followed by hematuria or granulomatous prostatits, epidydimoorchitis, urethral obstruction, and less than 1% have a systemic disease followed by dissemination of bacteria into other organs. CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old man underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. One month after the operation BCG intravesical installations were administered for three weeks. After the fourth installation, our patient developed high fever, fatigue, vomiting, dark urine, light stools, and jaundice. On admission he was jaundiced with a high fever, enlarged liver and spleen and laboratory findings which included high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase and aminotranspherases. The bone-marrow biopsy showed granulomatous inflamation suggesting mycobacterial spread in the bone marrow, liver and spleen and sepsis. The patient was initially treated with antituberculous therapy, but his state did not improve until corticosteroids were added to the antituberculous treatment regimen. CONCLUSION: Although dissemination of BCG is a rare complication of intravesical BCG treatment of the bladder carcinoma, it may result in prolonged fever and granulomatous inflamation of the liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow and BCG sepsis. Antituberclous agents in combination with corticosteroids comprise the treatment of choice for disseminated BCG infection."

15700669,[Evaluation of the Tween 80 opacity test for detection of the lipolytic activity of various Candida species and its utility in differentiation of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis].,2004,"In this study a total of 253 strains belonging to 10 different species of Candida were examined for their lipolytic activity by using the Tween-80 opacity test. Hundred and seventy-four of 182 C. albicans, all of 21 C. tropicalis, 1 C. rugosa and 2 of 5 C. famata strains produced halo on Tween 80 medium and around the inoculum after 10 days of incubation pointing out the positive lipolytic (esterase) activity. Seven of 8 negative C. albicans strains were isolated from hemocultures of patients with different malignancies. Remaining strains of Candida species; C. glabrata (12), C. dubliniensis (6), C. kefyr (8), C. guillermondii (5) and C. spherica (3) did not produce the halo. Tween 80 medium may be useful for the presumptive identification of some Candida species but regarding our results further large scale studies are necessary to establish the role of the medium in differentiating particularly the two similar species, C. albicans and C. dubliniensis."
15655643,The failed intraperitoneal colon anastomosis after colon resection.,2004,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to present the incidence of anastomotic leakage after colon resection and intraperitoneal anastomosis for colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the last ten years, 205 patients underwent colonic resection with intraperitoneal anastomosis for colon cancer. The surgical management of colorectal cancer consisted of 66 right hemicolectomies, 3 transverse colectomies, 17 left hemicolectomies, 98 sigmoid colectomies and 21 high anterior resections of the rectum. Diagnosis of leakage was made by clinical features, blood vessel examinations and abdominal CT-scans. RESULTS: Anastomotic leakage occurred in 5 out of 205 patients (2.4%). One of these patients underwent emergency surgery and the other 4 elective surgery; 3 by manual, 2 by mechanical suture. Three patients with anastomotic leakage were reoperated on days 4, 5 and 7, and 2 patients were treated conservatively. Two of the patients (20%) with anastomotic leakage died due to sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the rate of anastomotic leakage in patients with intraperitoneal anastomosis after colon resection for colorectal cancer is low, it remains a significant complication and a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality."
25674207,Inhibition of mTORC1 renders cardiac protection against lipopolysaccharide.,2014,"Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction is a severe clinical problem. It is evident that rapamycin can protect heart from pathological injuries. However, there are no data demonstrating rapamycin reverse cardiac dysfunction induced by sepsis. In this study, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administrated to mice and H9c2 cells. After treatment, we further determined cardiac function by echocardiography, ANP, BNP and inflammatory markers by qPCR and apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Moreover, mTORC1 signaling pathway and Akt activity were measured by Western blots. We found that rapamycin attenuated cardiac dysfunction, increase in ANP and BNP as well as apoptosis induced by LPS both in mice and in H9c2 cells. Unexpectedly, LPS did not significantly affect the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Furthermore, rapamycin further reduced the decrease in mTORC1 signaling and Akt activity induced by LPS. In conclusion, rapamycin can protect heart from LPS induced damages by inhibition mTORC1 signaling and elevation of Akt activity."
32598758,[Treatment of candidemia caused by Candida albicans and Candida non - albicans in patients with hematological malignancies].,2019,"AIM: To study the risk factors, symptoms and outcomes of candidemia caused by C. albicans and C. non - albicans in patients with hematological malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with hematological malignancies and candidemia. The diagnosis of candidemia was established according to the single isolation of Candida spp. from blood culture and the presence of symptoms of infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Over 12 years (2006-2017), candidemia was diagnosed in 75 patients aged 17 to 77 years (median 48 years). The causative agents of candidemia were C. albicans in 34.7% of patients, C. non - albicans - in 65.3%. Candidemia caused by C. albicans prevailed in patients of the older age group (median 56.5 years, p=0.04) and in patients with lymphoma (61.5%, p=0.01) with colonization of the gut by the same species of Candida (88.5%, p=0.002). Isolation of C. non - albicans from blood culture was more common in patients with acute leukemia (51%, p=0.01) and in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (22.5%, p=0.01). The ability to form biofilms was observed more frequently among C. non - albicans (59.2%) than C. albicans (19.2%, p=0.001). The clinical symptoms of candidemia were non - specific (fever was in 97%). Septic shock developed in 25 (33%) patients with comparable frequency in both groups. Concomitant infections was also comparable (73% vs. 73.5%). Overall 30-day survival in patients with candidemia caused by C. albicans and C. non - albicans was 61.2% and 61.5%. Treatment with echinocandin was associated with increase of survival compared to other antifungal agents among patients with C. albicans candidaemia (88.9% versus 40%, p=0.02) and among C. non - albicans (77.3% versus 47.8%). CONCLUSION: C. non - albicans constituted a high proportion among causative agents of candidemia. High mortality rate was observed in both groups. Initial therapy with echinocandin was associated with increase of survival."
31819560,"Incidence, Bacterial Profiles, And Antimicrobial Resistance Of Culture-Proven Neonatal Sepsis In South China.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis (NS) is one of the leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality, but little is known about pathogen incidence and distribution in China. METHODS: In this retrospective study (January 2012 to December 2016), culture-proven cases aged less than 28 days with diagnosed NS in the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, South China, were analyzed for pathogen incidence and antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: A total of 620 isolates were identified from 597 NS cases. Gram-negative bacteria (n=371, 59.8%) dominated over Gram-positive bacteria (n=218, 35.2%) and fungi (n=30, 4.8%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.9%), Escherichia coli (21.9%), group B Streptococcus (GBS, 13.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%) were the four most predominant pathogens. In early-onset sepsis (EOS), GBS (30.0%) and E. coli (20.0%) were dominant, whereas in late-onset sepsis (LOS), K. pneumoniae (25.6%) and E. coli (22.4%) were dominant. E. coli (25.2%) and GBS (17.7%) were the most frequently isolated from term patients, whereas K. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated from preterm patients (34.9%). Of the infected infants, 9.5% died from sepsis, most commonly by E. coli infection (16.2%). Among 91,215 live births (LBs) delivered in the study hospital (2012-2016), 252 infants developed sepsis infection (2.76 per 1000 LBs, 95% CI 2.4-3.1), including EOS (0.78 per 1000 LBs) and LOS (2.13 per 1000 LBs). All GBS isolates were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, and S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were susceptible to vancomycin. An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer was identified in 37.3% of E. coli and 50.4% of K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in culture-proven NS in South China, primarily associated with LOS in preterm, whereas GBS was the dominant pathogen in EOS. E. coli was common in both episodes with the highest mortality."
16215117,"Nutrition support in the morbidly obese, critically ill patient.",2004,"Nutrition support in the critically ill patient is challenging but is even more difficult in a morbidly obese patient. This case report chronicles the care of a 6-foot-tall, 256-kg male (body mass index 76.5 kg/m(2)) who spent over a month in the intensive care unit for respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure. Parenteral nutrition was provided throughout his critical care course. One of the major difficulties encountered was determining his nutritional needs. A hypocaloric nutritional regimen was used, along with moderate protein provisions. Numerous electrolyte imbalances occurred, including hypercalcemia that did not resolve by eliminating calcium from the parenteral nutrition solution. Enteral nutrition was desired but was not used initially because of a need for vasopressors, a diagnosis of pancreatitis, difficulty in documenting feeding tube placement because of diagnostic limitations secondary to the patient's large size, and concern about managing stools. Eventually, oral intake and supplemental enteral feeding were initiated. Nutrition support team members worked closely with the interdisciplinary care team to develop strategies to manage the nutritional problems related to his obesity. A discussion of the various nutritional issues encountered in the care of this patient is provided. Reasonable nutritional status was achieved, but this case reflects some of the challenges encountered in caring for the nutritional needs of select patient populations in clinical practice and the need for increased research and guidelines in this area."

41402810,"Determinants of surgical management outcomes among adult patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu central hospital, Malawi.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Intestinal obstruction causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings. Understanding factors influencing surgical outcomes is crucial for improving patient care. This study aimed to assess the determinants of surgical management outcomes among adult patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu Central Hospital, Malawi. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 262 adult patients diagnosed with intestinal obstruction between July 2021 and June 2024. Data were collected through patient chart reviews, focusing on demographic characteristics, care- and disease-related factors, and outcomes of surgical management (death and discharge). Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise patient characteristics, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of surgical outcomes, with statistical significance set at p </= 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 46.6 +/- 19.2 years (range, 15-94 years). The overall mortality rate was 39(14.9%), whereas 223(85.1%) were successfully discharged, and 30(16.2%) developed wound infections. The average duration of illness before admission was 5.0 +/- 7.5 days, and the average hospital stay was 10.6 +/- 9.3 days. Most patients, 138(52.7%), presented with small bowel obstruction, predominantly due to adhesions, 63(24.0%) and viable small intestinal volvulus, 24(9.3%). Among patients with large bowel obstruction, the leading causes were viable sigmoid volvulus, 39(14.1%) and gangrenous sigmoid volvulus, 28(10.7%). In the bivariate analysis, variables such as age, ASA score, malaria test results, haemoglobin levels, preoperative sepsis, and abdominal distension had p-values < 0.25 and were therefore included in the multivariable logistic regression model. After adjustment, only ASA score >/= III [AOR = 5.05, 95% CI: 1.86-13.60; p < 0.001] and abdominal distension [AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 0.99-5.61; p = 0.050] remained independently associated with unfavourable surgical outcomes. CONCLUSION: An ASA score >/= III and clinical manifestation of abdominal distension are key determinants of unfavourable surgical management outcomes in patients with intestinal obstruction at Mzuzu Central Hospital. Strengthening perioperative assessment and timely surgical intervention are recommended to enhance the patient outcomes."
31888744,Effects of perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on monocytic HLA-DR expression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass: study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is known to be associated with a transient postoperative immunosuppression. When severe and persistent, this immune dysfunction predisposes patients to infectious complications, which contributes to a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and even mortality. Effective prevention and treatment methods are still lacking. Recent studies revealed that acupuncture-related techniques, such as electroacupuncture and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), are able to produce effective cardioprotection and immunomodulation in adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, which leads to enhanced recovery. However, whether perioperative application of TEAS, a non-invasive technique, is able to improve immunosuppression of the patients with post-cardiosurgical conditions is unknown. Thus, as a preliminary study, the main objective is to evaluate the effects of TEAS on the postoperative expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen (-D related) (mHLA-DR), a standardized ""global"" biomarker of injury or sepsis-associated immunosuppression, in patients receiving on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: This study is a single-center clinical trial. The 88 patients scheduled to receive CABG under CPB will be randomized into two groups: the group receiving TEAS, and the group receiving transcutaneous acupoint pseudo-electric stimulation (Sham TEAS). Expression of mHLA-DR serves as a primary endpoint, and other laboratory parameters (e.g., interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10) and clinical outcomes (e.g., postoperative infectious complications, ICU stay time, and mortality) as the secondary endpoints. In addition, immune indicators, such as high mobility group box 1 protein and regulatory T cells will also be measured. DISCUSSION: The current study is a preliminary monocentric clinical trial with a non-clinical primary endpoint, expression of mHLA-DR, aiming at determining whether perioperative application of TEAS has a potential to reverse CABG-associated immunosuppression. Although the immediate clinical impact of this study is limited, its results would inform further large-sample clinical trials using relevant patient-centered clinical outcomes as primary endpoints.

15633694,Inactivation of Enterobacter sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula by monocaprylin.,2004,"Enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen that causes meningitis, bacteremia, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates and children, with a mortality rate of 14%. Epidemiological studies have implicated dried infant formula as the principal source of the pathogen. Caprylic acid is a natural eight-carbon fatty acid present in breast milk and bovine milk and is approved as generally recognizable as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of monocaprylin (monoglyceride ester of caprylic acid) on E. sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula. A five-strain mixture of E. sakazakii was inoculated into 10-ml samples of reconstituted infant formula (at 6.0 log CFU/ml) followed by 0, 25, or 50 mM (1%) monocaprylin. The samples were incubated at 37 or 23 degrees C for 0, 1, 6, and 24 h and at 8 or 4 degrees C for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h, and the surviving populations of E. sakazakii at each sampling time were counted. The treatments containing monocaprylin significantly reduced the population of E. sakazakii (P < 0.05) compared with the controls. Monocaprylin (50 mM) reduced the pathogen by >5 log CFU/ml by 1 h of incubation at 37 or 23 degrees C and by 24 h of incubation at 8 or 4 degrees C. Results indicate that monocaprylin could potentially be used to inactivate E. sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula; however, sensory studies are warranted before its use can be recommended."
15921643,[Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome): a pathology for burn units].,2004,"Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) is a rare but very serious dermatological lesion, characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, signs of systemic toxicity and intense mucocutaneous exfoliation. Its pathophysiology is not yet well determined, although it is almost consensual the presence of an immunological basis. It appears usually as an answer to the taking of a given drug, and, in spite of being self-limited in the absence of complications, if not well managed it is associated with great morbidity and a high mortality, due, in most cases, to the developing of sepsis. Treatment includes mainly the immediate suspension of the inducing drug and the precocious admission of the patient in a hospital facility with the capacity to provide intensive support care and to minimize the infectious risk, having also the conditions for the execution of surgical debridement and covering of the affected areas, that is to say in Burn Units. There are in study several therapeutical measures designed to lower the morbidity and mortality of this syndrome, namely the use of plasmapheresis; the administration of high doses of N-acetylcysteine; immunosuppression; hyperbaric oxygen, etc. The authors present the treatment protocol in use at the Coimbra Burns Unit, in Portugal, illustrated with a clinical case from that Unit."
41497531,LncRNA PCED1B-AS1 Inhibits Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury by Promoting Transformation of Macrophages from M1 to M2 Type via Regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 Axis.,2025,"PURPOSE: A common complication observed in septic patients under intensive care is acute kidney injury (AKI), which is characterized by acute onset and strong inflammation, resulting in poor clinical outcomes for patients. This study aims to explore the expression status of PCED1B-AS1 in sepsis-induced AKI and to preliminarily investigate the molecular mechanism by which PCED1B-AS1 affects AKI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 105 healthy individuals and 220 patients with sepsis (110 patients with AKI and 110 non-AKI patients). The levels of PCED1B-AS1 were examined by RT-qPCR. Macrophage polarization was induced by LPS treatment of RAW264.7 cells, and an in vitro renal injury model was established using HK-2 cells. Cell proliferation ability was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the levels of inflammatory factors were assessed using ELISA kits. The dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the interrelationship among the PCED1B-AS1/miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis. RESULTS: PCED1B-AS1 was downregulated in sepsis patients without AKI and further reduced in AKI patients. PCED1B-AS1 could differentiate healthy individuals from non-AKI sepsis patients and identify AKI patients. Additionally, low PCED1B-AS1 expression correlated with poor AKI prognosis. Overexpression of PCED1B-AS1 promoted the polarization of M1 macrophages to M2 by regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and inflammatory responses in HK-2 cells. CONCLUSION: PCED1B-AS1 may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker and inhibit sepsis-induced AKI by promoting transformation of macrophages from M1 to M2 type via regulating the miR-361-3p/SOCS1 axis."
31839974,"Heterogeneity of Cause, Care, and Prognosis in Severe Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Patients: A Prospective Observational Study.",2019,"BACKGROUND: KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) defines acute kidney injury (AKI) solely by serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output variation. Severe AKI is a syndrome covering various clinical situations. OBJECTIVE: To describe severe AKI heterogeneity by department of hospitalization. DESIGN: This is a prospective observational single-center study. SETTING: Adult patients hospitalized in a French tertiary hospital from August 2016 to December 2017. PATIENTS: All adults with severe AKI, defined by dialysis for AKI or an increase in SCr above 354 mumol/L. MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory presentation, AKI cause, medical indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT), planned palliative care, and vital status 30 days after severe AKI. METHODS: A global description of patient characteristics, care, and prognosis and comparison by department of hospitalization: intensive care unit (ICU), nephrology, and others. RESULTS: The study included 480 patients (73% men, median age: 72 years, range: 64-83), with medical histories including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. Principal causes were sepsis (104; 22%), hypovolemia (98; 20%), obstructive AKI (84; 18%), acute tubular necrosis (ATN; 74; 15%), and cardiorenal syndrome (51; 11%). Severe AKI was diagnosed in the ICU for 188 (39%) patients, the nephrology department for 130 (27%), and in other wards for 162 (34%). Patient characteristics differed by department for age, comorbidity, cause, and RRT use and indications. Palliative care was planned for 72 (15%) patients, most frequently in other wards. LIMITATIONS: We studied a subgroup of stage 3 KDIGO AKI patients in a single center without cardiac surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized for severe AKI have frequent and various comorbidities, different clinical presentations, care, hospitalization in various departments, and different prognosis. The heterogeneity of this severe AKI implies the need for personalized care, which requires prognostic tools that include information besides SCr and diuresis."

31930151,A Promising Candidate: Heparin-Binding Protein Steps onto the Stage of Sepsis Prediction.,2019,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection. With high morbidity and mortality of this disease, there is a need to find early effective diagnosis and assessment methods to improve the prognosis of patients. Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a granular protein derived from polynuclear neutrophils. The biosynthetic HBP in neutrophils is rapidly released under the stimulation of bacteria, resulting in increased vascular permeability and edema. It is reasonable to speculate that the HBP in plasma may serve as a novel diagnostic marker for sepsis, bacterial skin infection, acute bacterial meningitis, leptospirosis, protozoan parasites, and even some noncommunicable diseases. It implies that in the detection and diagnosis of sepsis, it will be possible to make relevant diagnosis through this new indicator in the future. In this review, we summarize the typical biological function of HBP and its latest research progress to provide theoretical basis for clinical prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."
20214221,Lovastatin and fluvastatin reduce viremia and the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the patients with chronic hepatitis C.,2009,"BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Certain statins interfere with the mechanism of the hepatitis C virus replication. We aimed at studying the effect of statins on the level of viremia and of the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODOLOGY: We took in our study all the patients with chronic hepatitis C placed in the evidence of the clinics of internal medicine of the Emergency County Clinical Hospitals of Brasov, Oradea and Sibiu, who had been identified with viremias. The patients were treated with fluvastatin 40 mg/day or lovastatin 20 mg/day for 28 days. The level of viremia, hemoleukogram, hepatic biochemical tests and the pro and anti-inflammatory hepatic cytokines were analysed before and after the treatment. The final results were compared with the initial ones, as well as between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Regarding those 99 analysed patients, the initial average viremia was of 2376074 +/- 3427596 UI/ml, while the final one was of 1321136 +/- 1343570 UI/ml (p = 0.000987). Both, in the group treated with lovastatin, as well as in that treated with fluvastatin, the decrease of viremia was significant from the statistics point of view (p = 0.032, respectively p = 0.00092). Lovastatin administration resulted in the significant decrease of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alfa, while that of fluvastatin brought about the significant decrease of the serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alfa. There were no significant differences, statistically speaking, between the 2 determinations, regarding the levels of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) and those of erythropoietin. Transaminases average level did not vary significantly after those 4 weeks of statins treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin and fluvastatin, significantly decrease the level of viremia, of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the patients with chronic hepatitis C."
41460586,Neutrophil extracellular traps associated with severity and prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia.,2025,"This study aimed to verify whether neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was related to the severity of respiratory tract infections (RTI) and establish a prognostic model for severe respiratory infections. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from RTI patients for RNA sequencing. Weighted Graph Co-expression Network Analysis was performed to identify gene modules and analyze the correlation between gene modules and clinical features. The prognostic model was established by LASSO regression. The concentration of IL-8 in plasma was measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gene expression levels in PBMC were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In total, 120 patients with RTIs were enrolled between July 2022 and March 2024. Enrichment analysis showed that NETs formation was enhanced during the early stages of pneumonia and sepsis. IL-8 had the strongest correlation with NETs formation, and the concentration of IL-8 in the plasma of patients with sepsis was significantly higher than that in patients with pneumonia and healthy controls (p < 0.001). NET-related genes were positively correlated with the SOFA score and 7-category ordinal scale. The expression level of MPO and PADI4 in sepsis patients were higher than that in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) alone and healthy controls. The AUC of the prognostic prediction model for severe CAP composed of two genes (PADI4-CD177) showed the best performance, with an AUC of 0.917. This study confirmed that NETs formation was activated in RTI and the 2-gene signature provided a rapid and highly accurate biomarker for predicting the prognosis of severe CAP, which awaits further verification in a prospective cohort."

METHODS: This study was a retrospective, single-medical-center analysis, conducted in the intensive care unit of a university hospital. Twenty-four sequential PCA patients were included. Plasma samples were collected from the patients on days 1, 2, and 3 after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Glucagon was compared in patients with favorable and unfavorable neurological outcomes. RESULTS: At all time points, plasma glucagon was significantly higher in patients with an unfavorable outcome (P<0.05). Glucagon on day 1 had remarkable sensitivity (88.2%) and specificity (85.8%) as an indicator of outcome, and correlated with the collapse-ROSC interval, the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)-ROSC interval, and the epinephrine dose during CPR. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma glucagon reflects unfavorable outcomes in PCA patients, and might be related to ischemic and reperfusion stress."
32156386,Ethanol extract of propolis prevents high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity in association with modulation of gut microbiota in mice.,2020,"Propolis has beneficial effects anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes and anti-obesity in human or murine models, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study was to investigate the effects of ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) on the gut microbiota, and to analyze the associations between these alterations of gut microbiota and insulin resistance and obesity in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow diet, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet supplemented with 1% EEP or 2%EEP. EEP supplementation reduced HFD-induced weight gain and liver fat accumulation, proinflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance, and improved glucose tolerance and lipid profile. Meanwhile, EEP supplementation in HFD-fed mice increased anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory bacteria such as genera Roseburia and Intestinimonas and species Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Parabacteroides distasonis, and reduced pro-inflammatory bacteria such as genera Faecalibaculum and Prevotella and species Bacteroides vulgatus. These dominant bacterial taxa altered by EEP were significantly associated with the metabolic parameters of insulin resistance and obesityin HFD-fed mice. The results in this study indicated that EEP reduced HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistant, which may be mediated by modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota."
41583262,Lemierre's Syndrome: A Rare but Resurging Disease.,2025,"Lemierre's syndrome is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) secondary to oropharyngeal infection, most commonly caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report the case of a healthy 22-year-old male patient who presented with a sore throat, right-sided neck swelling, and sepsis. Blood cultures revealed F. necrophorum. Imaging confirmed IJV thrombosis and multiple cavitating pulmonary nodules consistent with septic emboli. The patient was managed with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, vasopressor support, and temporary anticoagulation. He made a recovery and was discharged home to complete an extended course of antibiotics. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of Lemierre's syndrome in young adults presenting with oropharyngeal infection and systemic features of sepsis. Prompt diagnosis, prolonged anaerobic antibiotic therapy, and multidisciplinary input are vital to favorable outcomes."
19938709,[Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of synthetic colloid solutions in the treatment of severe abdominal sepsis: a randomized comparative study].,2009,"Infusion therapy, surgical debridement of an infection focus, and antimicrobial therapy are basic treatments for severe sepsis. At the same time there are no uniform guidelines on how to choose fluids for infusion therapy. The results of individual studies serve as the basis for refusing the use of synthetic colloid agents in the therapy of severe sepsis. The presented multicenter, randomized comparative study has evaluated different synthetic colloid solutions in early targeted therapy for severe sepsis. Evidence is provided for the identical effectiveness of the compared solutions in correcting hypovolemia and stabilizing hemodynamics in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock."
15657675,Rectal duplication cyst presenting as perianal sepsis: report of two cases and review of the literature.,2004,"INTRODUCTION: Recurrent perianal sepsis is a difficult problem to manage in colorectal surgical practice. One cause is rectal duplication cyst, a rare congenital lesion that is easily overlooked. Many cases have associated congenital defects, especially musculoskeletal anomalies, and may provide a clue to the underlying condition. Early diagnosis is important because these cysts do not resolve spontaneously and may undergo malignant change. METHODS: We present two cases of middle-aged females who presented with perianal sepsis secondary to rectal duplication cyst. The first case had numerous surgical procedures for a perianal fistula during a ten-year period. She had associated sacral anomalies consistent with Currarino syndrome. The second case presented with a perineal mass after a bout of perianal inflammation. Both cases had the entire cyst surgically excised. RESULTS: There were no complications postoperatively and no recurrence at follow-up. Histopathology revealed no malignancy in the cyst. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal duplication cyst is a rare cause of recurrent perianal sepsis that should be considered in difficult cases, especially in those with associated musculoskeletal anomalies. Complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment to prevent recurrence and the risk of malignant degeneration."
32335648,Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Clinical Samples in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the commonest cause of nosocomial infections. Resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain has become a matter of concern. This study was done to find out the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus from different clinical samples. METHODS: The descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Clinical Microbiology laboratory from January 2019 to June 2019. Ethical approval was received from the Institutional Review Committee (Ref: 28122018010). Six hundred sixty-six sample size was calculated. Convenient sampling was done. Staphylococcus aureus was identified on the basis of its microscopy and morphological characteristics followed by catalase and coagulase test. Antibiotic sensitivity test of misolated pathogens was done using Muller Hinton Agar by Kirby-Bauer method. Statistical analysis was done by Excel 2018, point estimate at 95% confidence interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: Out of the 666 bacteria isolated from clinical specimens, 133 (19.96%) were Staphylococcus aureus at 95% confidence interval (12.91-13.60%). Seventy nine (78.95%) of which is isolated from pus and wound infections. Out of 133 Staphylococcus aureus, 94 (70.64%) were Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable information regarding the high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus from pus and wound infections. The alarming number of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus is worrisome finding. Antibiotics like Vancomycin and Linezolid which has not developed resistance should be cautiously used only in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus cases."
25980222,[Systemic inflammation: theoretical and methodological approaches to description of general pathological process model. Part IV. A dynamics of the process].,2014,"Systemic inflammation (SI) as a general pathological process is considered as a development of cellular stress in response to systemic action of damage factors. An Acute SI is characterized by wavelike course (a changing of activation and inhibition phases); a chronic SI is characterized by successive changing of stages of its progressive development. SI may be classified into three variants which are dependened on intensity of systemic alteration as well as on condition of anti-inflammatory systems: 1) a ""break"" is a fulminating process (e.g. fulminating sepsis), 2) a ""caving"" is a relatively gradual conversion of classical inflammation to systemic one; 3) a ""sticking"" is a typical chronic SI. An evolution of the acute SI is characterized by the 5 following phases: a development, hyperergic phases of the primary and the secondary phlogogenic impact, a resolution, and depressive phase. The last phase is a typical for the ""break"" variant and characterized by a tolerance, but not a resistance strategy to action of factors of systemic alteration. It is advisable to estimate SI with Integral Criteria (Scales), which reflect both of the development of a systemic inflammatory response and the following other particular processes of SI: the systemic alteration, the micro thrombosis and other microcirculatory disorders, multiple organ dysfunction, and a distress of the neuroendocrine system."
25542602,"An analysis of etiology, causal pathogens, imaging patterns, and treatment of Japanese patients with bronchiectasis.",2015,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis (BE), a syndrome that presents with persistent or recurrent bronchial sepsis related to irreversibly damaged and dilated bronchi, has not been well-characterized in Asians. This study aims to review the etiology, causal pathogens, imaging patterns, and treatment of BE and to define the prognostic factors for acute exacerbation in a Japanese population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 147 patients (104 women; median age, 73 years; range, 30-95 years) with BE at our institution using high-resolution computed tomography to identify imaging patterns and the area of pulmonary involvement. RESULTS: Common BE etiologies were idiopathic (N=50 [34%]), sinobronchial syndrome (N=37 [25%]), non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM; N=26 [18%]), and previous respiratory infection (N=21[14%]). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causal pathogen (24%). Common imaging patterns were cylindrical (66%) and mixed including cylindrical pattern (47%). The median number of involved lobes was 2; 49% of the patients had >/= 3 involved lobes, and 49% had middle lobe and left lingula dominant BE. Patients with predominantly lower lobe BE comprised 4% of the NTM group and 48% of the non-NTM group (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, cystic BE was a predictor for frequent exacerbations in non-NTM patients (OR=7.947; P=0.004) which led to increased hospital admissions (OR=4.691; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic and sinobronchial syndrome were common causes of BE. Etiology did not contribute to imaging pattern or predictors of exacerbations. Cystic BE was a predictor for frequent exacerbations in the non-NTM BE patients."
15709787,[Phenotypic evaluation to differentiate Candida albicans from Candida dubliniensis].,2004,"This study evaluated the phenotypic tests used to differentiate Candida albicans from Candida dubliniensis. A total of 55 isolates from vaginal secretions, oral cavity and hemoculture were studied. They were originally identified as C. albicans, based on their morphological and physiological characteristics. These isolates were tested for colony color development on CHROMagar Candida medium, growth at 45 degrees C on Sabouraud Dextrose agar, lipolytic activity on Tween 80 Agar medium and colony morphology and chlamydoconidia formation on Staib agar medium. Of the 55 isolates studied, seven yielded one or more phenotypic characteristics suggestive of Candida dubliniensis. These isolates were tested by PCR with specific primers for Candida dubliniensis and API ID 32. The seven isolates were confirmed as Candida albicans. All of these finding indicate that DNA based tests should be used for definitive identification of Candida dubliniensis."
15585877,The virulence function of Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A involves inhibition of complement activation and impairment of complement receptor-mediated protection.,2004,"Complement is important for elimination of invasive microbes from the host, an action achieved largely through interaction of complement-decorated pathogens with various complement receptors (CR) on phagocytes. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) has been shown to interfere with complement deposition onto pneumococci, but to date the impact of PspA on CR-mediated host defense is unknown. To gauge the contribution of CRs to host defense against pneumococci and to decipher the impact of PspA on CR-dependent host defense, wild-type C57BL/6J mice and mutant mice lacking CR types 1 and 2 (CR1/2(-/-)), CR3 (CR3(-/-)), or CR4 (CR4(-/-)) were challenged with WU2, a PspA(+) capsular serotype 3 pneumococcus, and its PspA(-) mutant JY1119. Pneumococci also were used to challenge factor D-deficient (FD(-/-)), LFA-1-deficient (LFA-1(-/-)), and CD18-deficient (CD18(-/-)) mice. We found that FD(-/-), CR3(-/-), and CR4(-/-) mice had significantly decreased longevity and survival rate upon infection with WU2. In comparison, PspA(-) pneumococci were virulent only in FD(-/-) and CR1/2(-/-) mice. Normal mouse serum supported more C3 deposition on pneumococci than FD(-/-) serum, and more iC3b was deposited onto the PspA(-) than the PspA(+) strain. The combined results confirm earlier conclusions that the alternative pathway of complement activation is indispensable for innate immunity against pneumococcal infection and that PspA interferes with the protective role of the alternative pathway. Our new results suggest that complement receptors CR1/2, CR3, and CR4 all play important roles in host defense against pneumococcal infection."
26400802,"Descriptive analysis of diabetes-related amputations at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, Fiji, 2010-2012.",2014,"SETTING: The Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) in Fiji. OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who underwent lower limb amputations at the CWMH from 2010 to 2012. DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of data contained in operating theatre registers and clinical records of DM patients who had undergone amputations during the study period. RESULT: Of the 938 amputations performed at the CWMH during the study period, significantly more patients were male than female (54.1% vs. 45.9%) and more i-Taukei (indigenous Fijian) than Indo-Fijian (71% vs. 26.2%); 15.9% of patients had not previously been diagnosed as having DM when they presented with foot sepsis. The rate of smoking was highest in male i-Taukei patients. A large proportion of patients (76.8%) had poor glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that male i-Taukeis are most at risk, and that uncontrolled DM is a significant factor associated with amputations. There is a need to strengthen DM screening and improve glycaemic control. Foot care education needs to be implemented at diagnosis and re-enforced with regular clinic visits and complication screening sessions."
31817439,"Subphenotypes in Patients with Septic Shock Receiving Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone, and Thiamine: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.",2019,"This study aimed to identify septic phenotypes in patients receiving vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine using temperature and white blood cell count. Data were obtained from septic shock patients who were also treated using a vitamin C protocol in a medical intensive care unit. Patients were divided into groups according to the temperature measurements as well as white blood cell counts within 24 h before starting the vitamin C protocol. In the study, 127 patients included who met the inclusion criteria. In the cohort, four groups were identified: ""Temperature >/=37.1  degrees C, white blood cell count >/=15.0 1000/mm(3)"" (group A; n = 27), "">/=37.1  degrees C, <15.0 1000/mm(3)"" (group B; n = 30), ""<37.1  degrees C, >/=15.0 1000/mm(3)"" (group C; n = 35) and ""<37.1  degrees C, <15.0 1000/mm(3)"" (group D; n = 35). The intensive care unit mortality rates were 15% for group A, 33% for group B, 34% for group C, and 49% for group D (p = 0.051). The temporal improvement in organ dysfunction and vasopressor dose seemed more apparent in group A patients. Our results suggest that different subphenotypes exist among sepsis patients treated using a vitamin C protocol, and clinical outcomes might be better for patients with the hyperinflammatory subphenotype."
25631593,"Australian Staphylococcus aureus Sepsis Outcome Programme annual report, 2013.",2014,"From 1 January to 31 December 2013, around Australia 26 institutions around Australia participated in the Australian Staphylococcal Sepsis Outcome Programme (ASSOP). The aim of ASSOP 2013 was to determine the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) isolates in Australia that are antimicrobial resistant, (with particular emphasis on susceptibility to methicillin) and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of the isolates. Overall 19.1% of the 2,010 SAB episodes were methicillin resistant, which is significantly higher than that reported in most European countries. Although the SAB 30-day all cause mortality appears to be decreasing in Australia, methicillin-resistant SAB associated mortality remains high (20.1%) and was significantly higher than methicillin-sensitive SAB associated mortality (13%) (P< 0.0001). With the exception of the ss-lactams and erythromycin, antimicrobial resistance in methicillin sensitive S. aureus remains rare. However, in addition to the ss-lactams, approximately 50% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were resistant to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin and approximately 20% were resistant to co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and gentamicin. Linezolid, daptomycin and teicoplanin resistance was detected in a small number of S. aureus isolates. Resistance to vancomycin was not detected. Resistance was largely attributable to 2 healthcare associated MRSA clones; ST22-IV [2B] (EMRSA-15) and ST239-III [3A] (Aus-2/3 EMRSA). ST22-IV [2B] (EMRSA-15) has now become the predominant healthcare associated clone in Australia. Approximately 60% of methicillin-resistant SAB were due to community associated clones. Although polyclonal, almost 50% of community associated clones were characterised as ST93-IV [2B] (Queensland CA-MRSA) and ST1-IV [2B] (WA1). CA-MRSA, in particular the ST45-V [5C2&5] (WA84) clone, has acquired multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and tetracycline. As CA-MRSA is well established in the Australian community, it is important antimicrobial resistance patterns in community and healthcare associated SAB is monitored as this information will guide therapeutic practices in treating S. aureus sepsis."
41488892,Ascariasis in a child with recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage: case report and literature review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the most common soil-transmitted helminth infections worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation. While most cases are asymptomatic, heavy infections can lead to serious complications including intestinal obstruction, biliary colic, and pancreatitis. This article reports a case of melena in a 4-year-old child associated with ascariasis and explores the potential pathological mechanisms and management strategies through a comprehensive literature review. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy was admitted with a one-month history of cough, lethargy for 4 days, and coma lasting 10 h. He had been diagnosed with septic shock, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at a local hospital, where he received endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and antimicrobial therapy before being transferred to our institution for further management. During hospitalization, he experienced recurrent melena, which required blood product transfusion to correct anemia. Further investigations eventually identified ascariasis as a potential underlying contributing factor. Melena in this patient was likely related to septic shock-induced coagulopathy or mucosal ischemia, rather than direct Ascaris injury. The patient was treated with albendazole, and ultimately made a full recovery and was discharged successfully. CONCLUSIONS: Ascaris lumbricoides infection represents a rare yet critical associated factor in septic shock complicated by severe gastrointestinal bleeding in children. This case report and literature review demonstrate that successful management hinges on early identification of the parasitic infection coupled with timely anthelmintic therapy following hemodynamic stabilization. However, the severe clinical manifestations are often directly caused by secondary bacterial infections. Clinicians, particularly those in endemic regions, require heightened vigilance for this potential complication."
31898560,[Changes in neutrophil function in septic liver injury and its effect on prognosis: a prospective observational study].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) function in peripheral blood of patients with sepsis and liver injury and its prognostic value. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. The patients who met the criteria of Sepsis-3 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from March to August in 2019 were enrolled as the research objects, and the patients were divided into sepsis without liver injury group and sepsis with liver injury group; non-sepsis patients who were hospitalized at the same time were enrolled as non-sepsis group; and the healthy people in the physical examination center were enrolled as healthy control group. The gender, age, white blood cell (WBC), PMN and procalcitonin (PCT) were recorded when the patients were admitted to ICU as well as the people on the day of physical examination. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated. The 28-day mortality was recorded. The quantitative level of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which reflected by circulating free DNA (cf-DNA/NETs) in peripheral plasma was determined by PicoGreen fluorescence quantitative detection; the qualitative level of NETs was detected by immunofluorescence staining. PMN was extracted from the healthy control group, sepsis without liver injury group and sepsis with liver injury group and cultured in vitro, the quantitative level of cf-DNA/NETs in cell supernatant was determined by PicoGreen fluorescence quantitative detection. The patients were divided into two groups according to 28-day outcome of sepsis patients with liver injury. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted, and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to analyze the prognostic value of NETs in sepsis patients with liver injury. RESULTS: Finally, 21 sepsis patients without liver injury, 15 sepsis patients with liver injury, 20 with non-sepsis and 20 with healthy examination were enrolled. There was no significant difference in gender or age among the four groups, indicating that the patients in each group were comparable. The levels of cf-DNA/NETs in peripheral blood, WBC and PMN of the sepsis with and without liver injury groups were significantly higher than those of the healthy control group and non-sepsis group, PCT, APACHE II score, SOFA score and 28-day mortality were significantly higher than those of the non-sepsis group, and the levels of cf-DNA/NETs in peripheral blood, PCT and 28-day mortality of the sepsis with liver injury group were significantly higher than those of the sepsis without liver injury group [cf-DNA/NETs (mug/L): 481.60+/-275.86 vs. 169.76+/-57.05, PCT (mug/L): 11.29 (1.79, 67.10) vs. 1.11 (0.19, 4.09), 28-day mortality: 73.3% (11/15) vs. 38.1% (8/21), all P < 0.05]. The results of PMN in vitro showed that there was no NETs in normal culture of healthy control group, and a small amount of NETs was detected in sepsis with and without liver injury groups. After stimulation of PMN stimulator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetic acid (PMA), more NETs were produced in neutrophils of three groups compared with normal culture. Quantitative analysis showed that the level of cf-DNA/NETs in cell supernatant of the sepsis with liver injury group was significantly higher than that of the sepsis without liver injury group (mug/L: 1 872.29+/-258.44 vs. 1 313.55+/-147.45, P < 0.01). In 15 sepsis patients with liver injury, 4 patients survived for 28 days (26.7%) and 11 died (73.3%). The cf-DNA/NETs level of the dead group on the day of admission was significantly higher than that of the survival group (mug/L: 582.36+/-160.05 vs. 241.17+/-96.14, P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of NETs level in peripheral blood for predicting 28-day death of sepsis patients with liver injury was 0.932 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.787-1.000]; when the best cut-off value was 266.81 mug/L, the sensitivity was 90.9%, the specificity was 75.0%, and the approximate index was 0.659. CONCLUSIONS: The function of NETs in sepsis patients with liver injury has been further changed. The level of peripheral blood NETs has a certain guiding value for the prognosis of sepsis patients with liver injury."
18209439,Spectrum of tuberculosis in dialysis patients in saudi arabia.,2003,"Data from different regional hospitals of Saudi Arabia were collected to know the prevalence, clinical features and results of therapy of tuberculosis, in patients on dialysis. Eight hospitals located in five different provinces of Saudi Arabia were involved. There were 132 patients with TB on dialysis of whom 75 were males (mean ages in different hospitals ranging 42-58 years) and 57 were females (mean ages ranging 38-58 years). The prevalence of TB in these patients varied from 2.4 to 14.5% with an average of 7%, which is 12 times commoner than in the general population of Saudi Arabia. The presenting clinical features were fever (65%), cough (17%), weight loss (59%) and anorexia (58%). The organs/systems involved by TB were pulmonary in 73 (55.3%), lymphadenopathy in 30 (22.7%) peritoneal in 27 (20.4%) and bone in seven (5.3%). The diagnosis of TB was made by X-ray chest in 73, positive acid fast bacilli in sputum in 38, lymph node biopsy in 30, ascitic fluid examination in 20 and other tests in 17 patients. Four anti-TB drugs namely, isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (Rif), ethambutol (Eth) and pyrazinamide (Pyra) were used in 58 patients (44%) for six months; three drugs namely, INH, Rif, and Eth or Pyra were used in 61 patients (46%) for a variable period of six to 12 months. A total of 28 (21%) patients expired, eight while on therapy, one before starting the therapy and 19 after they were cured of TB. The main causes of death were sepsis in eight (28.5%), cardiovascular in seven (25%) and sudden death in six (21%). TB was not the direct cause of death in any of the patients except one, in whom it could be contributory."
20034949,Rosiglitazone ameliorates endotoxin-induced organ damage in conscious rats.,2011,"Rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist. By inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), it decreases tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Endotoxin shock can induce the production of several inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, leading to multiple organ dysfunction and death. We investigated the effects of rosiglitazone (.3 mg/kg, intravenous administration) on the physiologic attributes and cytokine levels in endotoxin shock in conscious rats. Endotoxin shock was induced by intravenous injection of Klebsiella pneumoniae lipopolysaccharides (LPSs; 10 mg/kg) in conscious rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored for 24 hr after LPS administration. Levels of biochemical and cytokine parameters, including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hr after sepsis. Endotoxin shock significantly increased blood GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, glucose, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels and HR, while also decreasing MAP. Rosiglitazone diminished the increase in HR, decreased the markers of organ injury (GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, glucose) and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha, IL-6), and did not affect MAP after LPS. In conclusion, rosiglitazone ameliorated endotoxin shock-induced markers of organ injury and suppressed the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in conscious rats."

AIM: We aim to present our experience regarding the manifestations and outcomes of Salmonella infections in a group of Filipino SLE patients. METHODS: This study reviewed the medical records of Filipino SLE patients with documented Salmonella infection seen at the Rheumatology Clinics of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Hospital, Manila, Philippines from 2002 to 2009. RESULTS: Included were 12 patients (11 female), with mean age of 25.75 years (range 11-53 years) and average SLE disease duration 4.45 years to Salmonella infection. Five had septic arthritis (knee in 4, hip in 1), one of whom had concomitant typhoid fever. Another two patients had typhoid fever only. Sepsis syndrome was noted in three. One patient each had soft tissue abscess and meningitis. Salmonella typhi was isolated in seven patients, Salmonella sp. in four, and S. enteritidis in one patient. Two patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), another had mixed Salmonella and Klebsiella pneumonia. Eleven patients were on high-dose steroids for active disease, including one patient with antecedent first infusion of cyclophosphamide plus rituximab. Management consisted of antimicrobials and adjunct surgery for arthritis and abscess. Except for three patients with Salmonella sepsis, all other patients improved with appropriate therapy."
20032118,Nitro-oleic acid protects against endotoxin-induced endotoxemia and multiorgan injury in mice.,2010,"Nitroalkene derivatives of nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) are endogenous lipid products with potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of OA-NO2 in mice given LPS. Two days before LPS administration, C57BL/6J mice were chronically infused with vehicle (LPS vehicle) or OA-NO2 (LPS OA-NO2) at 200 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1) via osmotic minipumps; LPS was administered via a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection (10 mg/kg in saline). A third group received an ip injection of saline without LPS or OA-NO2 and served as controls. At 18 h of LPS administration, LPS vehicle mice displayed multiorgan dysfunction as evidenced by elevated plasma urea and creatinine (kidney), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; liver), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced ejection fraction (heart). In contrast, the severity of multiorgan dysfunction was less in LPS OA-NO2 animals. The levels of circulating TNF-alpha and renal TNF-alpha mRNA expression, together with renal mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, and with renal mRNA and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and renal cGMP and PGE2 contents, were greater in LPS vehicle vs. control mice, but were attenuated in LPS OA-NO2 animals. Similar patterns of changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators were observed in the liver. Together, pretreatment with OA-NO2 ameliorated the inflammatory response and multiorgan injury in endotoxin-induced endotoxemia in mice."

METHODS: Prospective analytical study of hospitalized children diagnosed with pyomyositis from May 2016 to April 2017 at the Ricardo Gutierrez Children's Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with pyomyositis were identified. Annual rate: 21.5/10,000 admissions (95% CI 4.65-71.43). The median age was 5.4 years (range 1.25-11.6). The lower limbs were the most affected site. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in all patients, with a mean of 124 mg/L (SD 96), being significantly higher in patients with bacteremia: 206 (DS 101) vs 98 (DS 81), p = 0.02. Bacterial cultures were positive in 17/21 (80.9%): 15 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 2 Streptococcus pyogenes. Blood cultures were positive in 5 (23.8%). CONCLUSION: MRSA-community acquired is the predominant pathogen in our setting. In the selection of the appropriate empirical treatment, the local resistance pattern and the CRP value should be taken into account."
15630646,Prophylactic antibiotic use in pediatric burn units.,2004,"Prophylactic antibiotic use in childhood burns is controversial. The efficiency of antibiotic prophylaxis in 77 pediatric burn patients was evaluated. Forty-seven patients received prophylactic antibiotics (Group AP), while 30 patients received no prophylaxis (Group NP). Age, wound depth, day of admission, mechanism of burn injury, type of dressings were similar for both groups (p > 0.05). Wound infection rates were 21.3 % in Group AP and 16.7 % in Group NP (p > 0.05). S. aureus, Enterobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, and E. coli were the most common microorganisms. Patients with wound colonization and infection had a larger burned total body surface area (BTBSA) in both groups (p < 0.01). Eight patients had clinical sepsis. All but one of the septic patients were from Group AP. Associated infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract (16), urinary tract (7), and otitis media (2) were more common in Group AP. One patient died from sepsis in Group AP. Hospital stays were longer in Group AP (21.7 +/- 16.4 vs. 13.5 +/- 10 days; p < 0.05). Antibiotic prophylaxis in childhood burns does not reduce the rate of wound infection. Age, wound depth and BTBSA are not critical variables for prophylaxis. Reinforcing the use of culture-specific antibiotics for more beneficial and cost-effective results in the treatment of childhood burns is recommended."
31860776,Patterns of presentation and survival of HIV-infected patients admitted to a tertiary-level intensive care unit.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Compared to other countires internationally, South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV. There are limited data in developing countries on the outcomes of HIV-infected patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objectives of this study were to describe the pattern of presentation of these patients and to determine factors that may influence survival to ICU discharge. METHODS: The medical charts of 204 consecutive HIV-infected individuals who were admitted to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital adult general ICU during the calendar year 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Relevant data were subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Two-hundred and four (22.6%) out of a total of 903 patients who were admitted to the ICU were HIV positive. Sepsis-related illnesses were the most common reason for ICU admission (n = 95; 46.6%), followed by post-operative care (n = 69; 33.8%) and non-sepsis-related illnesses (n = 40; 19.6%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 5 (interquartile range 2-9) days. ICU mortality was 33.3% (n = 68). On univariate analysis, age (P = 0.039), length of stay in the ICU (P = 0.040), primary diagnostic category (P < 0.05), sepsis acquired during the ICU stay (P = 0.012), inotrope/vasopressor administration (P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), haemodialysis (P = 0.001), CD4 cell count (P = 0.011), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment (APACHE) II score (P < 0.001) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Age, diagnostic category, sepsis acquired during the ICU stay, inotrope/vasopressor administration, mechanical ventilation, haemodialysis, CD4 cell count, APACHE II score, SOFA score and length of ICU stay were associated with ICU mortality in HIV-infected patients."
41497096,A silent journey from kidney to lungs: pyelonephritis triggering septic pulmonary embolism - a rare case report from Nepal.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by infected thrombi from extrapulmonary sites lodging in pulmonary arteries, resulting in infarction and infection. Its nonspecific presentation, including fever, cough, and chest pain, often delays diagnosis. Predisposing factors include infective endocarditis, intravascular catheters, oropharyngeal infections, and urinary tract infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old female with hypertension and diabetes mellitus arrived with fever, active cough, sudden shortness of breath, and pain in her left flank. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral lung nodules with cavitation, wedge-shaped opacities, and feeding vessel indications, all of which were suggestive of SPE. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein. Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in both urine and sputum cultures. The patient was given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and ICU care, which included mechanical ventilation. The antibiotic medication was adjusted based on culture sensitivity, resulting in gradual clinical improvement. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: SPE diagnosis is difficult due to vague symptoms, but can be supported by CT findings such as peripheral nodules, cavitation, wedge-shaped lesions, and feeding vessel indications. Early identification of the major illness source and the use of targeted broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial. Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, cancer, necrotizing pneumonia, and fungal diseases; fast cavitation and peripheral spread favor SPE. CONCLUSION: SPE should be suspected in patients with extrapulmonary infections presenting with pulmonary nodules or cavitation, particularly when CT shows feeding vessel signs. Prompt diagnosis, removal of infectious sources, and early, appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to improve patient outcomes."
31833341,Epidemiological study of pediatric severe sepsis in Argentina.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Severe sepsis (SS) is one of the leading causes of pediatric mortality in Argentina. The objective was to describe the epidemiological characteristics and to analyze risk factors associated with mortality from SS among patients hospitalized in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in Argentina. POPULATION AND METHODS: Observational, prospective cohort study among patients with SS hospitalized in PICUs in Argentina from 8/1/2008 to 9/30/2008. RESULTS: Two thousand five hundred and fifty nine patients were admitted at 59 PICUs. A total of 315 patients (335 events) were included. Patients' median age was 8 months (1-182). The frequency was 13.8 %, and 28-day mortality was 31.6 %. Patients with a higher mortality were those who were coming from rural areas, had comorbidities at the time of admission or a history of cancer, had shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), were administered low-dose corticosteroids or vasoactive drugs or more than 60 ml/kg of fluid in the first hour and in the first 6hours, and had severe malnutrition. Following adjustment by severity using a multivariate logistic regression model, only coming from a rural area, having shock or ARDS remained associated with 28-day mortality. Forty per cent of patients received antibiotics 60 minutes after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: SS is an event with a high frequency and mortality in Argentina. In the severity adjusted multivariate analysis, only coming from a rural area, having ARDS and/or shock were associated with higher mortality."

This article reports the aortic occlusion of a 15-year-old male who had undergone recent emergent splenectomy and induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After initial stabilization, he developed progressive sepsis and ischemia, with cross-sectional imaging findings of pneumomediastinum and descending aorta intraluminal thrombus, which rapidly progressed to aortic occlusion. His clinical status continued to decompensate until he ultimately succumbed to his disease."
25886324,"Amalgamation of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and sequential organ failure scoring system in predicting sepsis survival.",2014,"BACKGROUND: The clinical value of inflammatory biomarkers is still questionable. AIM OF THE WORK: The aim of this study is to compare the clinical informative value of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentration in the early detection of sepsis, as well as relating these biomarkers to other scoring systems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 138 patients were enrolled in our study. All were subjected to PCT, CRP, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores daily for 7 days (starting from admission day). Blood samples were collected before starting antibiotics, with 28 days follow-up and patients were assigned to three groups: Group I: SOFA 2-7, Group II: SOFA 8-10, and Group III: SOFA >/=11. RESULTS: Underlying clinical diagnosis revealed pneumonia in 72 patients, urinary tract infections in eight, bloodstream infection in four, and other infections in 23, while infection could not be traced in 25 patients. The mean PCT was 3 ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-4), 12 ng/ml (95% CI: 9.1-14), and 19 ng/ml (95% CI: 16.3-22.3) in Groups I, II, and III, respectively, with a statistically significant difference in the mean PCT level among the three groups (P < 0.0001). On the other hand, CRP mean level did not significantly differentiate between the groups (147.1 mg/L in Group II, which was even higher than the level of Group III, 138.4 mg/L). CONCLUSION: PCT seems to do better than CRP in predicting the SOFA groups, giving its patronage display over a wide spectrum of insults."
31885243,Mucormycosis in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia following liver transplantation for Wilson's disease.,2019,"A case is presented of mucormycosis in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia following liver transplantation for Wilson's disease. A 58-year-old female was admitted to the Department of Haematology with deterioration of her general condition, loss of appetite, tiredness and difficulty with mental contact for a few days. Blood and urine cultures for bacteria and fungus, galactomannan antigen were negative. Whole body computed tomography demonstrated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with necrotic lesions: splenomegaly with a hypodensive lesion 13 x 20 x 19 mm and lower pulmonary infiltrates suggested fungal etiology. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed thickened meninges. Finally, mucormycosis was diagnosed. Treatment with amphotericin B lipid complex was started, resulting in an partial improvement of the general condition and decreased level of inflammatory markers. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with sepsis etiology Escherichia coli, and despite the intensive managements she eventually died."
20053608,[Catheter- associated bacteremia caused by Ochrobactrum anthropi].,2009,"Ochrobactrum anthropi is a non-glucose fermentative, aerobic gram-negative bacillus, formerly known as Achromobacter sp or CDC group Vd. It has been isolated from the environment and from infections in usually immunocompromised human beings. The documented infections frequently involved catheter related bacteremia whereas endophthalmitis, urinary infections, meningitis, endocarditis, hepatic abscess, osteochondritis, pelvic abscess and pancreatic abscess were rarely involved. Here it is presented the case of a male patient aged 69 years with sustained hypotension, four day febrile syndrome, chill, lavish perspiration and sensorium deterioration. He had type 2 diabetes and antecedent of cerebrovascular accident. A double-lumen dialysis catheter was present due to chronic renal insufficiency. An episode of catheter-related bloodstream infection was documented by using Bact-Alert Blood Culture System and Differential-Time-to-Positivity Method for central venous catheter versus peripheral blood cultures (>120 min). Once removed, it was confirmed through Maki semi quantitative technique (>15 FCU). The microorganism was identified by API 20NE and Vitek 1 as Ochrobactrum anthropi."
25707091,Body mass index as a predictor of postoperative complications in loop ileostomy closure after rectal resection in Japanese patients.,2014,"Loop ileostomy is widely employed after low rectal anastomosis to prevent pelvic sepsis from anastomotic leakage. However, stoma closure carries a risk of morbidity and even mortality in some cases. It is important to assess complications after stoma closure for maximizing the benefit of making loop ileostomy. The aim of this study was to review and examine the possible risk factors associated with complications after closure of loop ileostomies. A retrospective analysis, which focused on risk factors for complications after surgery, was performed for 82 consecutive patients who underwent elective closure of loop ileostomy from 2005-2012 at Hiroshima University Hospital. Postoperative complications developed in 22 patients (26.8%): 12 (14.6%) had an ileus, 8 (9.8%) had a wound infection, 2 (2.4%) had an intraperitoneal abscess and 1 had pseudomembranous enterocolitis. There was no postoperative mortality. In univariate analysis, gender and higher body mass index (BMI) were identified as significant risk factors for postoperative complications. After multivariate analysis, a BMI of 24 kg/m2 was identified as the cut-off value, above which significantly higher incidences of postoperative complications were observed. Furthermore, patients who succeeded in reducing their weight (BMI < 24 kg/m2) between the first and second surgeries had less morbidity than patients who remained obese (BMI > 24 kg/m2). Our study showed that the majority of complications associated with ileostomy closure are ileus. A BMI > 24 kg/m2 is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. Weight loss programs before stoma closure might reduce postoperative complications."
15580538,Large vancomycin overdose in two premature infants with minimal toxicity.,2004,"Two premature infants received 10-fold overdoses of vancomycin with resulting peak plasma concentrations > 300 microg/mL. Discontinuation of vancomycin and watchful waiting were employed, with no specific intervention to accelerate vancomycin clearance. Plasma vancomycin concentration < 40 microg/mL was attained at < 48 hours in one infant and < 72 hours in the other. Although one infant sustained a transient increase in serum creatinine to 1.4 mg/dL, no further evidence of renal, auditory, or other toxicity was detected in either infant acutely or long term. Contemporary preparations of vancomycin appear much less toxic than earlier formulations. Aggressive and invasive interventions to hasten clearance may be unnecessary following overdose in infants with normal or near-normal basal renal function, although careful surveillance for clearance and toxic effects still appear warranted."
41456846,Impact of anticoagulants and centrifugal forces on plasma neutrophil extracellular traps assay outcomes.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could help prevent and treat thrombosis-related diseases. Detecting NETs primarily relies on plasma; however, the impact of anticoagulants and plasma centrifugation on these results remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the most effective anticoagulant and centrifugation methods for detecting NETs in plasma. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from sepsis rats using sodium citrate and EDTA as anticoagulants. These samples were subjected to various centrifugal forces, durations, and temperatures to determine the optimal method for NETs analysis. Similarly, plasma samples from infected patients were collected and analyzed using different centrifugation techniques to identify the optimal method. Gene expression analysis in endothelial cells stimulated by these plasma samples was conducted to compare the endothelial responses to NETs levels. RESULTS: In rats, EDTA-plasma exhibited increased levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA, while dsDNA levels remained unchanged, with both concentrations being higher at 400 g. Similarly, EDTA and a centrifugal force of 400 g increased MPO-DNA levels without affecting dsDNA levels in patients. Plasma isolated using a centrifugal force of 400 g enhanced adhesion, inflammation, and chemotaxis gene expression in endothelial cells, demonstrating that low centrifugal force is effective for NETs detection. CONCLUSION: For an accurate NETs assay, it is recommended to use EDTA anticoagulant and prepare plasma using a low centrifugal force, such as 400g."
32154020,Cardiotoxicity after cancer treatment: a process map of the patient treatment journey.,2019,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Cardiotoxicity is a potential complication of anticancer therapy. While guidelines have been developed to assist practitioners, an effective, evidence based clinical pathway for the treatment of cardiotoxicity has not yet been developed. The aim of this study was to describe the journey of patients who developed cardiotoxicity through the healthcare system in order to establish baseline data to inform the development and implementation of a patient-centred, evidence-based clinical pathway. METHODS: Mixed-methods design with quantitative and qualitative components using process mapping at 3 large medical centres in 2 states between 2010 and 2015. RESULTS: Fifty (50) confirmed cases of cardiotoxicity were reviewed (39 medical record reviews, 7 medical record review and interviews and 4 internview only). The mean age at cancer diagnosis of this group was 53.3 years (range 6-89 years); 50% female; 30% breast cancer, 23% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; mean chemotherapy cycles 5.2 (median 6; range 1-18); 49 (89%) presented to chemotherapy with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors; 39 (85%) had at least one modifiable risk factor and 11 (24%) had more than 4; 44 (96%) were diagnosed by echocardiogram and 27 (57%) were referred to a cardiologist (only 7 (15%) before chemotherapy). Post chemotherapy, 22 (48%) patients were referred to a multidisciplinary heart failure clinic; 8 (17%) to cardiac rehabilitation; 1 (2%) to cancer survivorship clinic and 10 (22%) to a palliative care service. There were 16 (34%) deaths during the timeframe of the study; 4 (25%) cardiac-related, 6 (38%) cancer-related, 4 (25%) due to sepsis and 2 (12%) other causes not recorded. The main concerns participants raised during the interviews were cancer professionals not discussing the potential for cardiotoxicity with them prior to treatment, nor risk modification strategies; a need for health education, particularly regarding risks for developing heart failure related to cancer treatment; and a lack of collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the clinical management of cancer patients with cardiotoxicity was variable and fragmented and not patient centered. This audit establishes practice gaps that can be addressed through the design of an evidence-based clinical pathway for cancer patients with, or at risk, of cardiotoxicity."
31826630,A case report of acute apendicitis in puerperium.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: This article stresses an impact of appropriate management work up in the diagnosis of acute apendicitis in puerperium. Atypical clinical symptoms may cause doubts in diagnosis and may delay necessary surgical intervention. DESIGN: Case report. SETTINGS: Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, and Hospital Na Bulovce, Prague. METHODS: We present a case report describing an atypical presentation of acute apendicitis in early puerperium. Due to atypical course of the disease and atypical imaging locality and morphology, there were doubts about the diagnosis of acute apendicitis, patient was treated conservativelly and the disease later resulted in extensive surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of non-urogenital morbidity in puerperium. Management of work up and timing of surgical intervention have key impact on maternal mortality and morbidity."
41422448,Search for novel biomarkers of febrile neutropenia in hematological patients: an overview.,2025,"A single-center prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kuopio Finland over the past two decades, searching for novel biomarker candidates to predict complicated course of febrile neutropenia (FN) in hematological patients. In Dec 2006‒Dec 2015, 85 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 179 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were included. More than 20 biomarkers were evaluated in subsequent patient cohorts and compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). The samples were taken on d0-d2 from the beginning of FN. Here, we provide an overview of the results of these studies. Most biomarkers evaluated did not provide additional prognostic benefit compared to CRP or PCT. The most promising biomarkers warranting further studies include soluble cluster of differentiation 14, interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18. Several biomarkers evaluated in this series of studies are hampered by impaired production by neutrophils/leukocytes (matrix metalloproteinase-8, cell-free plasma DNA and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) or platelets (vascular endothelial growth factor). For now, these novel biomarkers cannot substitute the conventional markers nor provide additional benefit in routine use. Optimally, the most promising novel markers should be evaluated in prospective multicenter studies with higher patient numbers and several endpoints to more reliably evaluate their performance. At present, close patient monitoring is imperative in hematological patients with FN. The additional information provided by novel FN biomarkers may be useful, but they should be evaluated combined with daily evaluation of sepsis scoring systems."
19933537,Synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide improves systemic and splanchnic circulation and has a lung-protective effect during endotoxemia in pigs.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is thought to maintain gut perfusion during circulatory stress and thereby avoid later failure of distant organs. In this controlled experimental study, we investigated the effects of carperitide, a synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system, on the systemic and splanchnic circulation during fluid-resuscitated endotoxemia in pigs. METHODS: Sixteen domestic pigs of both sexes were randomly divided into 2 groups. The pigs were anesthetized and their lungs ventilated before receiving either saline (Group A: n = 8) or carperitide (Group B: n = 8). After a baseline measurement was taken, the pigs from both groups received a continuous infusion (1.7 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) of endotoxin for 240 min. Group B received a continuous infusion of carperitide (0.05 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) starting 30 min before the endotoxin infusion and lasting until the end of the study, whereas Group A received the same volume of saline. Fluid resuscitation was titrated to maintain pulmonary artery wedge pressure between 10 and 12 mm Hg. Systemic and regional hemodynamics, oxygenation variables, and the arterial-to-intestinal PCO(2) gap were measured at baseline and after endotoxin infusion for 240 min. The primary end points were cardiac index, superior mesenteric artery flow index, and PCO(2) gap at the end of this study (T240). RESULTS: Cardiac index and superior mesenteric artery flow index in Group B were significantly higher than those in Group A at T240 (83 +/- 15 vs 135 +/- 23 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.001; 2.6 +/- 1.4 vs 7.9 +/- 4.8, P = 0.01), respectively. Carperitide administration resulted in a significantly better maintenance of intestinal mucosal perfusion assessed by the PCO(2) gap at T240 (33.0 +/- 14.5 vs 11.6 +/- 10.0 mm Hg, P = 0.004). The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio in Group B was significantly greater than that in Group A from T60 to T240. CONCLUSIONS: In this porcine fluid-resuscitated endotoxemia model, a low dose of carperitide administered before endotoxemia maintained systemic and splanchnic circulation, and prevented the deterioration of oxygenation. Atrial natriuretic peptide infusion is a potentially beneficial therapy with respect to systemic and splanchnic circulation as well as the respiratory system during sepsis."
25498899,Identification of mitochondrial deficits and melatonin targets in liver of septic mice by high-resolution respirometry.,2015,"AIMS: Previous data showed that melatonin maintains liver mitochondrial homeostasis during sepsis, but neither the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction nor the target of melatonin are known. MAIN METHODS: Here, we analyzed mitochondrial respiration in isolated mouse liver mitochondria with different substrate combinations (glutamate/malate, glutamate/malate/sucinate or succinate/rotenone) to identify mitochondrial defects and melatonin targets during sepsis. Other bioenergetic parameters including a + a3, b, and c + c1 content, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial supercomplexes formation were analyzed. Mitochondrial function was assessed during experimental sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in livers of 3 mo. C57BL/6 mice at early and late phases of sepsis, i.e., at 8 and 24 h after sepsis induction. KEY FINDINGS: Septic mice showed mitochondrial injury with a decrease in state 3, respiratory control rate, mitochondrial mass, and cytochrome b and c + c1 content, which was prevented by melatonin treatment. Mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis was mainly linked to complex I damage, because complex II was far less impaired. These mitochondria preserved the respiratory supramolecular organization, maintaining their electron transport system capacity. SIGNIFICANCE: This work strengthens the use of substrate combinations to identify specific respiratory defects and selective melatonin actions in septic mitochondria. Targeting mitochondrial complex I should be a main therapeutical approach in the treatment of sepsis, whereas the use of melatonin should be considered in the therapy of clinical sepsis."
19999020,[Chronic granulomatous disease].,2009,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency, a phagocyte defect that appears in 1:200,000 live births and is produced by mutations in the genes that codify for the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase). The inheritance form is X linked (> 60%) or autosomic recesive (30-40%). The NADPH oxidase is responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the activated phagocyte (""respiratory burst""). When present, mutations on the NAPDH oxidase genes do not allow the ROS production, making the neutrophils of these patients incapable to destroy pathogens. These patients are especially susceptible to infections by staphylococcus, fungi and some gram-negative bacteria. The main clinical manifestations include recurrent life-threatening episodes of lymphadenitis, abscess, pneumonias, osteomyelitis, granuloma formation and sepsis. The diagnosis is suggested by a history of recurrent infections, familiar cases, fail to grow and confirmed with an altered test of ROS production and the specific mutation. Allogenic stem cells transplant is the curative treatment. The early diagnosis and the treatment with prophylactic antibiotics and interferon-gamma have modified favorably the morbidity and mortality of these patients."
41458654,Intravesical Fungus Ball Caused by Candida albicans in a Diabetic Patient With Septic Shock: A Case Report.,2025,"Fungal urinary tract infections (UTIs) are rare. In exceptional cases, fungal colonization can lead to the formation of a ""Fungus ball"" or fungal bezoar, which may cause urinary tract obstruction and sepsis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, presenting with septic shock and anuria. Imaging studies revealed an intravesical mass with air locules, and urine cultures grew Candida albicans. Despite systemic antifungal therapy, persistent obstruction required surgical management. A cystoscopy and open surgical approach allowed complete extraction of a fungal bezoar. Histopathological analysis confirmed fungal structures consistent with Candida spp. The patient recovered after systemic fluconazole therapy, with follow-up imaging showing resolution of obstruction. Urinary tract fungus balls are uncommon and often associated with predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus, urinary stasis, and prolonged catheterization. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion supporting images. Treatment includes systemic antifungal therapy and, in selected cases, surgical removal. Although rare, a urinary fungus ball should be considered in diabetic patients with candiduria and obstructive findings on imaging. Early recognition and combined medical-surgical management are essential for favorable outcomes."
41430122,Diagnostic and management challenges of a case of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency in a resource-limited healthcare setting in Tanzania: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism represent a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. These conditions are frequently missed in low-resource settings due to their anticipated rarity and similarity of symptoms to conditions such as sepsis. We present a case of a neonate with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency whose diagnosis and management at our facility were complicated by limited healthcare resources. CASE REPORT: A three-day-old male of South Asian origin born to consanguineous parents presented with lethargy, hypothermia and respiratory distress. He was initially managed for suspected septic shock. However, further investigations revealed severe hyperammonemia for which he was managed with peritoneal dialysis and oral sodium benzoate. His care was coordinated by a multidisciplinary team and included teleconsultation with a metabolic specialist. Once stabilized, he was transferred to our sister institution in Pakistan for further care where genetic analysis revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant (c.1306_1307insT; p.Thr439fs*52) in the N-acetylglutamate synthase gene, confirming the diagnosis of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. However, the baby passed away at 49th day of life. CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion is important in diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism. Even in resource-limited setting, a multidisciplinary team with international partnership can optimize the care for patients with rare inborn errors of metabolism. There is also a need to increase awareness, improve diagnostic capacity and establish standardized treatment protocols for rare metabolic disorders in low-resource settings like Tanzania."
31880383,Interleukin-38 protects against sepsis by augmenting immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells.,2020,"Naturally occurring CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are required to limit immune-induced pathology and to maintain homeostasis during the early-phase of sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the role of interleukin (IL)-38, a newly described member of the IL-1 cytokine family, in mediated immune response of CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs in sepsis. Here, we provide evidence that expressions of IL-38 and its receptor were detected in murine CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs. Stimulation of CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs with LPS markedly up-regulated the expression of IL-38. Treatment with rmIL-38 dramatically enhanced the immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs after LPS stimulation and in septic mice induced by CLP, resulting in amplification of helper T cell (Th) 2 response and reduction in the proliferation of effector T cells. These effects were robustly abrogated when anti-IL-38 antibody was administered. Administration of rmIL-38 improved the survival rate of CLP mice. In addition, CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs depletion before the onset of sepsis obviously abolished IL-38-mediated protective response. These findings suggest that IL-38 enhances the immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs, which might contribute to the improvement of host immune function and prognosis in the setting of sepsis."
25544031,Patterns of monocyte subpopulations and their surface expression of HLA-DR during adverse events after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,2015,"Human leukocyte antigen DR surface expression in ""classical"" CD14++CD16- (M1), ""intermediate"" CD14++CD16+ (M2), and ""non-classical"" CD14+CD16++ (M3) monocytes reflects the activation state of these cells. The full spectrum of monocyte and its function is still unknown. The present pilot study describes the monocyte subpopulations and their human leukocyte antigen DR expression during the post-transplant period as well as during transplant-related adverse events of 30 pediatric patients and young adults with hemato-oncological malignancies and immunodeficiency disorders in comparison to healthy children and young adults. A significant change of the human leukocyte antigen DR expression in all three monocyte subpopulations during the period after bone marrow transplantation depending on the time after transplantation and adverse events could be recognized. Prior to and during sepsis or bacterial infection, a significant decrease in human leukocyte antigen DR expression occurred. A significant increase on CD14++CD16- monocytes could be observed during graft-versus-host disease. The alterations of human leukocyte antigen DR expression on the monocyte subpopulations during adverse events after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be a sign of changes in the capacity of these subpopulations. Moreover, human leukocyte antigen DR expression in monocyte subpopulations may be used to monitor treatment responses in these entities."

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 55 heifers. PROCEDURE: Heifers were vaccinated with a commercial MLV combination vaccine or given a sham vaccine (sterile water) and bred 47 to 53 days later. Heifers were challenged with type 1 or type 2 BVDV on days 75 to 79 of gestation. Clinical signs of BVDV infection, presence of viremia, and WBC count were assessed for 14 days after challenge. Fetuses were collected on days 152 to 156 of gestation, and virus isolation was attempted from fetal tissues. RESULTS: Type 1 BVDV was not isolated in any fetuses from vaccinated heifers and was isolated in all fetuses from nonvaccinated heifers challenged with type 1 BVDV. Type 2 BVDV was isolated in 1 fetus from a vaccinated heifer and all fetuses from nonvaccinated heifers challenged with type 2 BVDV. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A commercial MLV combination vaccine containing type 1 and type 2 BVDV given to the dam prior to breeding protected 100% of fetuses against type 1 BVDV infection and 95% of fetuses against type 2 BVDV infection. Use of a bivalent MLV vaccine in combination with a comprehensive BVDV control program should result in decreased incidence of persistent infection in calves and therefore minimize the risk of BVDV infection in the herd."
25541006,Validity of procalcitonin for the diagnosis of bacterial infection in elderly patients.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: PCT has been consolidated as a key tool in the diagnosis of bacterial infections in general population. Few studies have been conducted to determine the applicability of this test in elderly patients. METHODS: Study of validity of PCT on elderly patients. Two groups were formed; the first group was formed by patients aged 75 years or older, under bacterial infection criteria and PCT on the initial Lab test. The second group was formed by patients aged 75 years or older with any noninfectious disease; these patients were asked PCT in the initial Lab test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. RESULTS: 161 patients were included, 95 with probable bacterial infection and 66 without infection. Patients with probable bacterial infection criteria, 72% of them had PCT >0.5 ng/mL. Patients without infection, 8% of the patients had PCT >0.5 ng/mL. Sensitivity and specificity of PCT to bacterial infection with the cutoff value of 0.5 ng/mL was 72% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCT can be used in elderly patients to diagnose bacterial infections because it has proved good sensitivity and high specificity."
25519857,Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries.,2014,"BACKGROUND: In settings where both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection cause malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) need to distinguish which species is causing the patients' symptoms, as different treatments are required. Older RDTs incorporated two test lines to distinguish malaria due to P. falciparum, from malaria due to any other Plasmodium species (non-falciparum). These RDTs can be classified according to which antibodies they use: Type 2 RDTs use HRP-2 (for P. falciparum) and aldolase (all species); Type 3 RDTs use HRP-2 (for P. falciparum) and pLDH (all species); Type 4 use pLDH (fromP. falciparum) and pLDH (all species).More recently, RDTs have been developed to distinguish P. vivax parasitaemia by utilizing a pLDH antibody specific to P. vivax. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting non-falciparum or P. vivax parasitaemia in people living in malaria-endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria, and to identify which types and brands of commercial test best detect non-falciparum and P. vivax malaria. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 31 December 2013: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web of Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; and IndMED. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in non-falciparum endemic areas. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each study, two review authors independently extracted a standard set of data using a tailored data extraction form. We grouped comparisons by type of RDT (defined by the combinations of antibodies used), and combined in meta-analysis where appropriate. Average sensitivities and specificities are presented alongside 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). MAIN RESULTS: We included 47 studies enrolling 22,862 participants. Patient characteristics, sampling methods and reference standard methods were poorly reported in most studies. RDTs detecting 'non-falciparum' parasitaemiaEleven studies evaluated Type 2 tests compared with microscopy, 25 evaluated Type 3 tests, and 11 evaluated Type 4 tests. In meta-analyses, average sensitivities and specificities were 78% (95% CI 73% to 82%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 2 tests, 78% (95% CI 69% to 84%) and 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%) for Type 3 tests, and 89% (95% CI 79% to 95%) and 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 4 tests, respectively. Type 4 tests were more sensitive than both Type 2 (P = 0.01) and Type 3 tests (P = 0.03).Five studies compared Type 3 tests with PCR; in meta-analysis, the average sensitivity and specificity were 81% (95% CI 72% to 88%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) respectively. RDTs detecting P.vivax parasitaemiaEight studies compared pLDH tests to microscopy; the average sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI 86% to 99%) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%), respectively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: RDTs designed to detect P. vivax specifically, whether alone or as part of a mixed infection, appear to be more accurate than older tests designed to distinguish P. falciparum malaria from non-falciparum malaria. Compared to microscopy, these tests fail to detect around 5% ofP. vivax cases. This Cochrane Review, in combination with other published information about in vitro test performance and stability in the field, can assist policy-makers to choose between the available RDTs."
20109381,[Complications of elective esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGDS). Personal experience and literature review].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Although upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is reasonably safe, it is not perfectly so. The complication rate is about 0.1% for EGDS. Aim of this study is to schedule and evaluate all possible complications, starting from personal experience in Operative Unit of Surgical Endoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated all EGDS performed at the Operative Unit of Surgical Endoscopy of Policlinico in Palermo between January 2000 and January 2008. A single staff of endoscopists performed diagnostic and therapeutic exam. All complications were tabulated and scheduled to identify possible risk factors or indicators procedure- or patient-related. RESULTS: 5.258 patients (43.6 %) experienced temporary and self-limiting hypoxia (SaO2 < 85%); we report totally 18 complications (0.15%), according to literature data: 2 hypopharinx perforations (0.016%), 2 middle esophagus perforation (either with death of patients = 0.016%), 3 post-biopsy hematomas of the gastric wall (0.02%) and 2 duodenal wall (0.016%) 6 (0.04%) post-polypectomy bleeding, 1 abscess post-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) (0.008%) and 1 accidentally PEG remove (0.008%). DISCUSSION: EGDS-related complications may occur and cannot be prevented completely even in expert hands however, early recognition and proper management will lead to better outcome. Because of the complexity of endoscopic procedures has increased, endoscopists need to be aware of all possible procedure-related complications and should use strategies to minimize it. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic complications will inevitably occur if an endoscopist does many procedures. The knowledge of potential complications and their expected frequency can lead to improved risk-benefit analysis by physicians and patients as well as true informed consent by patients. Early recognition of complications and prompt intervention may minimize patient morbidity."
31823150,Pathogenic characteristics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia isolates in a high-endemicity setting for ST175 and ST235 high-risk clones.,2020,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents a major clinical concern. The interplay between antimicrobial resistance and virulence of P. aeruginosa was investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. Thirty-eight well-characterized (21 MDR and 17 non-MDR) P. aeruginosa strains from patients with bacteraemia were analysed. Resistance phenotype, carbapenemase production, clonal relatedness, type III secretion system genotype, O-antigen serotype, cytotoxicity (ability to lyse cells) on A549 cells, and virulence (lethality in nematodes) in a Caenorhabditis elegans model were investigated. MDR strains showed lower cytotoxicity (35.4 +/- 21.30% vs. 45.0 +/- 18.78 %; P = 0.044) and virulence (66.7% vs. 100%; P = 0.011) than non-MDR strains. However, the pathogenicity of MDR high-risk clones varied broadly, with ST235 and ST175 clones being the most and least cytotoxic (51.8 +/- 10.59% vs. 11.0 +/- 1.25%; P < 0.0001) and virulent ([100% vs. 73.1; P = 0.075] and [0% vs. 93.9%; P < 0.0001], respectively). The pathogenicity of the ST235 clone was similar to that of non-MDR strains, and its ability to lyse cells and high virulence were related with the exoU-positive genotype. Furthermore, the O11 serotype was more frequent among the ST235 clone and exoU-positive genotype strains and was also essential for the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. Our data suggest that the pathogenicity of MDR high-risk clones is the result not only of the resistance phenotype but also of the virulence genotype. These findings have implications for the clinical management of patients and infection control programmes."
31832353,Current AATS guidelines on surgical treatment of infective endocarditis.,2019,"The 2016 American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) guidelines for surgical treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) are question based and address questions of specific relevance to cardiac surgeons. Clinical scenarios in IE are often complex, requiring prompt diagnosis, early institution of antibiotics, and decision-making related to complications, including risk of embolism and timing of surgery when indicated. The importance of an early, multispecialty team approach to patients with IE is emphasized. Management issues are divided into groups of questions related to indications for and timing of surgery, pre-surgical work-up, preoperative antibiotic treatment, surgical risk assessment, intraoperative management, surgical management, surveillance, and follow up. Standard indications for surgery are severe heart failure, severe valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve infection, invasion beyond the valve leaflets, recurrent systemic embolization, large mobile vegetations, or persistent sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy for more than 5-7 days. The guidelines emphasize that once an indication for surgery is established, the operation should be performed as soon as possible. Timing of surgery in patients with strokes and neurologic deficits require close collaboration with neurological services. In surgery infected and necrotic tissue and foreign material is radically debrided and removed. Valve repair is performed whenever possible, particularly for the mitral and tricuspid valves. When simple valve replacement is required, choice of valve-mechanical or tissue prosthesis-should be based on normal criteria for valve replacement. For patients with invasive disease and destruction, reconstruction should depend on the involved valve, severity of destruction, and available options for cardiac reconstruction. For the aortic valve, use of allograft is still favored."
15717698,Influence of underlying disease on the outcome of critically ill patients with acute renal failure.,2004,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of acute renal failure (ARF) in critically ill patients is associated with an increase in hospital mortality. Recently, it was shown that starting renal replacement therapy early and using high-filtrate flow rates can improve the outcome, but this could not be confirmed in later investigations. Studying selected patient subgroups could provide a useful basis for patient selection in future trials evaluating the outcome of renal replacement therapies. We, therefore, investigated the impact of the underlying disease on the outcome of patients with ARF. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 306 patients with ARF who were treated with renal replacement therapy. Patients were classified according to six initial diagnosis groups: haemorrhagic shock, post-cardiac surgery, post-liver transplantation, trauma, severe sepsis and miscellaneous. Univariate and multivariate multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors influenced the outcome. RESULTS: Underlying disease proved to be the only independent risk factor for mortality that was present at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (P = 0.047). Patients with severe sepsis had a significantly higher mortality rate (68%) than ARF patients as a whole (51%) (P = 0.02). Length of stay in the ICU, the use of catecholamines, the delay before ARF onset, and the correlation between APACHE II score and ICU length of stay proved to be additional independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection and subgroup definition according to the underlying disease could augment the usefulness of future trials evaluating the outcome of ARF."

31821891,"HIV-1 low-level viremia affects T cell activation rather than T cell development in school-age children, adolescents, and young adults during antiretroviral therapy.",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Given the improvements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in recent years, more pediatric HIV patients receiving ART are reaching adolescence and adulthood. This study investigated the influence of poor virological response (low-level viremia (LLV) and virological failure (VF)) on the immune system of these patients. METHODS: HIV-infected, ART-experienced pediatric patients (n=206) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The patients were subdivided into school-age children/early adolescents, middle adolescents, and late adolescents/young adults according to their age, and further classified into virological suppression (VS), LLV, and VF groups according to plasma viral load (pVL) measurement. Thymic output, T cells subsets, and immune activation were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with VS patients, VF patients displayed decreased CD4(+) T cell counts, while LLV and VS patients had comparable CD4(+) T cell counts regardless of age. Compared with VS patients, LLV and VF patients had higher percentages of CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) and CD8(+)CD38(high) T cells, and the immune activation was positively correlated with pVL in VF and LLV patients. Thymic output levels (CD31(+)) and regulatory T cell subpopulations in LLV and VF patients were comparable to those in VS patients. LLV patients showed comparable percentages of T cell subsets (T(N), T(CM), T(EMRA), and T(EM)) as VS patients in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: LLV causes excessive immune activation although it does not impair T cell recovery or naive-to-memory T cell conversion in pediatric patients living with HIV. Therefore, T cell immune activation should be monitored at the management of LLV during ART."
20041994,Rhodotorula mucilaginosa catheter-related fungaemia in a patient with multiple myeloma.,2011,"To date, there have been several case reports of Rhodotorula infection in haematological patients, but none affecting patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We describe a 54-year-old man with MM receiving prophylaxis with fluconazole who was using a subclavian Port-A-Cath and presented two episodes of fungaemia caused by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The first episode was resolved with oral itraconazole and neutropenia recovery. During the second episode, caspofungin was administered without success; however, liposomal amphotericin B and catheter withdrawal resolved the fungaemia. As far as we know, this is the first case reported of R. mucilaginosa fungaemia in a patient with MM."
41523750,Multiple Cerebral Infarctions and Clinically Mild Encephalitis/Encephalopathy with a Reversible Splenial Lesion Associated with Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome: A Case Report.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rapidly progressing, fatal disease. Sepsis can be complicated by multiple cerebral infarctions, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), and sepsis-related encephalopathy, resulting in a poor prognosis. To our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of sepsis complicated by both multiple cerebral infarctions and MERS. We report a case based on a literature review. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 49-year-old man who experienced fever and a sore throat for 2 weeks prior to his visit. He was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Two days prior to his visit, he was confused and was transported to his previous hospital, where he was diagnosed with sepsis and treated conservatively. Although his confusion had improved the day before coming to the hospital, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple cerebral infarctions, and he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care. At the time of transfer, high signal intensity observed in the splenium of the corpus callosum on MRI was thought to be MERS. Blood tests revealed septic coagulopathy. He received intensive care and was discharged home on day 32. Head MRI performed during outpatient follow-up on the 15th day after discharge, we made a definitive diagnosis of MERS. CONCLUSION: We encountered a very rare case of STSS complicated by multiple cerebral infarctions and MERS, which had a favorable prognosis. The associations among sepsis, multiple cerebral infarctions, and MERS remain poorly understood, and further investigation is warranted."
19957504,[Analysis of clinical risk factors in progression from acute lung injury to acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe trauma patients].,2009,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential risk factors of affecting progression from acute lung injury (ALI) to acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe trauma population. METHODS: Twenty potential risk factors of affecting progression of acute lung injury were examined by univariate and multivariate logistic analyses among the severe trauma patients in a retrospective study. RESULTS: All of 375 specially severe trauma patients with ALI were included for analysis. The six risk factors that affected the progression from acute lung injury to acute respiratory distress syndrome were sepsis, duration of trauma, APACHE II score, DIC, aspiration of gastric contents, and advanced age. Specific risk factors also affected different patient subpopulations at different degrees. CONCLUSION: Impact of sepsis, DIC and duration of trauma that predict progression of ALI exists throughout the entire treatment period while aspiration of gastric contents and APACHE II score might affect aggravation of ALI only during the early period; due to deterioration of pulmonary function and severely traumatic injury, advanced age is still an independent risk factor; patients with these risk factors need aggressive supportive cares as early as possible in order to prevent further aggravations."

In general, mortality due to MDRO sepsis is significantly higher as compared to non MDRO sepsis. Reported morbidities include prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition, need for central venous catheter, invasive ventilation, increased duration of hospital stay and neurologic sequelae."
15744125,Two third-year medical student-level laboratory shock exercises without large animals.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Historically, medical schools have taught principles of hemodynamic shock using large animal models. Such exercises are infrequent today due to the increasing aversion of students and the wider community to the use of large animals in teaching. Herein, we describe two alternative exercises that communicated basic science and clinical principles of shock effectively. METHODS: We developed two complementary, distinct single-afternoon laboratory exercises for third-year medical students. The first exercise (lab) demonstrated three principles: (1) in vitro cytokine-induced apoptosis (illustrating mechanisms and consequences of sepsis), (2) the hemodynamic manifestations of hypovolemia and septic shock in rats, and (3) the effects of fluid resuscitation or vasopressor administration in these same rat models. In the second exercise, students managed the diagnosis, initial resuscitation, surgical treatment, and ICU care of a ""patient"" with abdominal sepsis, using a manikin-based patient simulator and actual patient test data. Current basic science and clinical literature were incorporated. RESULTS: Efficacy was evaluated by polling students in one of four rotations (n = 25). Educational value of the lab exercise was rated 3.70 (1, worst rating; 5, best rating), whereas its applicability to clinical care was rated 4.35. Educational value and clinical applicability of the patient simulator were rated 4.52 and 4.76, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These exercises combining laboratory demonstrations of the pathophysiologic mechanisms and manifestations of shock with simulation were judged effective and clinically relevant while fulfilling the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate to reduce use of experimental animals."
20042135,[A comparison of severity of illness scoring system for emergency department patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive ability of 3 scoring systems, i.e. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) and mortality in emergency department sepsis (MEDS) score in patients presenting systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in emergency department. METHODS: Six hundred and twenty-one adult patients with SIRS admitted from December 2006 to September 2007 in the emergency department of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were eligible for the study. The first 24-hour admission data necessary for the calculation of APACHE II score, SAPS II score, MEDS score and basic demographic statistics were collected and the outcomes in 28 days were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors for 28-day mortality. Discrimination of each scoring system was assessed with the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 222 patients died in 28 days in a total of 621 patients. The age and mean levels of 3 scoring systems were predominantly higher in nonsurvivors than survivors (73 years vs. 70 years for age, P<0.05; 18 vs. 14 for APACHE II score, P<0.01; 36 vs. 24 for SAPS II score, P<0.01; 14 vs. 7 for MEDS score, P<0.01). The independent predictors of 28-day mortality were APACHE II score, SAPS II score and MEDS score. The AUCs were 0.715, 0.774 and 0.965 for APACHE II score, SAPS II score and MEDS score, respectively. There was significant difference between MEDS score and APACHE II score in AUC (Z=35.435, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: In emergency department patients with SIRS, the MEDS score possesses more predictive ability than APACHE II score."
15977439,Experimental trypanosomiasis in Yankasa ewes: the body weight response.,2004,"Sleeping sickness (African Trypanosomasis) is an anthropozoonosis transmitted primarily by the tsetse fly. It is associated with a host of clinical indices ranging from fever, aneamia and anorexia to reproductive failures in man and his domestic animals. The main objective of this study is to appraise the responsiveness of the body weight as a clinical indicator of sleeping sickness in experimentally infected Yankasa ewes. Twelve mature Yankasa sheep (6 infected and 6 control ewes) were used in this study. Weekly body weights and daily rectal temperature were taken while blood samples for haematology were collected twice a week from all animals before and after the experimental infection. Undulating parasitaemia was observed, two days post infection and was sustained through out the study period of about fifty days in all the infected ewes. Decreased body weight was found to be very prominent in the infected animals. All the infected ewes progressively lost weight during the experiment with a decrease of about 17.9% of the original weights while the control ewes had increased by 4.2% at the end of the study period. The body weight is therefore a very sensitive parameter in the surveillance and management of Trypanosome infections especially in Yankasa ewes as experimental animal models."
41550605,Platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio stratifies surgical risk and mortality in necrotizing enterocolitis neonates with portal venous gas.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Portal venous gas (PVG) represents a severe complication of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), typically signaling disease progression and a poor prognosis. While PVG has traditionally been regarded as an indication for surgical intervention in NEC, accumulating clinical evidence indicates that not all cases require operative management. Currently, surgical decision-making for NEC neonates with PVG primarily relies on subjective clinical assessments by physicians, resulting in substantial management uncertainty. The platelet-to-C-reactive protein ratio (PCR), an objective and convenient biomarker integrating information on disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammation, has demonstrated predictive value in neonatal sepsis and other conditions. However, the utility of the PCR has not yet been explored in NEC-PVG patients. This study retrospectively evaluates the predictive value of the PCR for surgical intervention and prognosis in this high-risk population, aiming to facilitate early identification and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed 186 neonates diagnosed with NEC (Bell stage >/= IIa) and ultrasonographically confirmed PVG (2021-2024). We evaluated the PCR, calculated at the time of PVG diagnosis, for predicting surgical intervention and 30-day mortality by employing multivariate logistic regression (which included collinearity assessment and bootstrap validation) to identify independent factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess predictive performance and determine optimal cutoff values, supplemented by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort demonstrated a surgical intervention rate of 37.10% (69/186) and a 30-day mortality of 13.98% (26/186). Multivariate analysis identified the PCR as an independent predictor for both surgical intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.86) and mortality (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.92). ROC curve analysis established PCR thresholds of </=4.84 x 10(9)/mg for surgical intervention (AUC 0.84; sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%) and </=2.57 x 10(9)/mg for mortality prediction (AUC 0.80; sensitivity 69%, specificity 91%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the PCR is a promising predictor of surgical intervention and mortality risk in NEC-PVG patients, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to individual parameters. Based on these findings, we propose the incorporation of PCR testing into standard clinical monitoring protocols, using 4.84 x 10(9)/mg as a potential cutoff value to inform therapeutic decision-making. This approach may improve the clinical management and outcomes in this high-risk population."
15887827,Insulin therapy--role beyond glucose control.,2004,"Larger studies had shown improved patient outcome and lower probability of coronary artery disease in insulin treated groups. The classical lipid abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes are low HDL-cholesterol concentration and high triglyceride concentration. Insulin usage leads to a decrease in triglyceride concentration, primarily by its effect on the enzyme adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase. Insulin suppresses the enzyme, thereby controlling lipolysis in uncontrolled diabetes. Insulins therapy also improves the endothelial dysfunction especially in people with evident macrovascular complications. Though insulin is noted to increase adrenergic tone and may cause elevation of blood pressure, still patients with insulinoma do not have high blood pressure. Some studies suggest weight gain with insulin therapy, others contradict it. One study suggests that insulin does not affect treatment satisfaction. Insulin is known to improve the glycaemic scenario and also the insulin secretory pattern by reducing the glucotoxicity."
15724387,Hepatitis C Virus and related changes in immunological parameters in non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.,2004,"Viral hepatitis is a common and important problem in immunocompromised cancer patients. The present study was conducted to investigate changes in some cellular and humoral immunological parameters as a consequence of HCV infection in non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (NHL). The study included 40 NHL patients: 20 anti-HCV antibody positive (Gr. I ), and 20 anti-HCV antibody negative (Gr.II ). In addition, forty non-cancer controls (NCCs) were included: 20 of them were anti-HCV antibody positive (Gr. III) and 20 anti-HCV antibody negative (Gr. IV). The studied immunological parameters included serum levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (s-TNFr) measured by ELISA, as well as assessment of T and B lymphocyte subsets by PAP immunostaining method. Mean IL-1 level (pg/ml) was significantly higher in Gr. 1 (14 +/- 6) and Gr. III (20 +/- 12) as compared to those in Gr. II (7 +/- 5) and Gr. IV (9 +/- 6). Mean IL-2 level (pg/ml) was also significantly higher in Gr. I (132 +/- 101) and Gr. III (135 +/- 59) compared to those in Gr. II (36 +/- 29) and Gr. IV (31 +/- 48). On the other hand, level of IL-6 showed no significant difference between groups. The mean level of sTNF-r, (ng/ml) was only significantly higher in Gr. I (2.9 +/- 1.7) when compared to that in Gr. IV (1.9 +/- 2.2). In group IV, the average percentage of CD3 (70 +/- 4%) and CD4 (44 +/- 5%) were significantly higher than in those of Gr. I (CD3 = 51 +/- 11%, CD4 = 30 +/- 12%), Gr. II (CD3 = 52 +/- 7%, CD4 = 30 +/- 8%), and Gr. III (CD3 = 52 +/- 9%, CD4 = 26 +/- 8%). From all the above immunological and virological features two main tips could be inferred: (1) HCV leads a mild course of infection in NCCs evidenced by normal ALT level in all but 20% of subjects, normal IL-6, sTNF-r, lower counts of CD4+ T cells and hence a mild hepatocellular injury, and (2) In the immunocompromised NHL patients the virus leads potentially more aggressive course as evidenced by higher viremia, as well as significant elevation in sTNF-r, and CD8+ depression."
25510385,Prognosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in Buenos Aires: a prospective cohort study.,2014,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in whom PE has been ruled out (RPE) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate survival and diagnosis of new cancer in suspected PE patients at follow up. METHODS: A prospective cohort study nested in a prospective Institutional Registry of Venous Thromboembolic Disease was performed between 2006 and 2011. This study was designed to evaluate all consecutive, incident cases of suspected PE in adults. The study was performed at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, a tertiary level hospital, in hospitalized patients and outpatients. Suspected PE cases were collected using a computerized system that alerts whenever a physician requests pulmonary angiography, angiotomography, or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. PE was defined by pre-specified criteria and RPE was defined when diagnostic tests were negative for PE. RESULTS: We included 1736 cases of suspected PE. The prevalence of PE was 29% (n = 504). There was no difference in the overall survival at 30 days and follow-up between PE and RPE patients. The presence of provoked or unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease in these patients did not affect survival. The main causes of death were PE in the confirmed PE group (60%), and neoplasm (42%) and sepsis (37%) in the RPE group. Survival at 90 days was 63% for PE (95% CI 58-67%) and 67% for RPE patients (95% CT 64-69%). At follow-up, there was no difference in diagnosis of new cancer between PE and RPE patients (2% vs 2%, p = 0.82), even when taking into account the unprovoked group. CONCLUSIONS: Even when the main cause of death in PE patients is PE itself, the overall mortality is similar between PE and RPE patients. The reason for this finding could be because of the more frequent and severe comorbidities in RPE than in PE patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: HomeClinicalTrial.gov: NCT01372514."
25307331,Red blood cells transfusion in intensive care unit.,2009,"BACKGROUND: The anemia is a common problem upon admission of the patients in the intensive care unit being the red blood cell transfusion a frequent therapeutic. The causes of anemia in critical patients who under go red blood cell transfusion are several: acute loss of blood after trauma, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, surgery amongst others. Currently, few studies are available regarding the use of blood components in patients at intensive care unit. Although blood transfusions are frequent in intensive care unit, the optimized criteria for handling are not clearly defined, with no available guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical indications of the use of the red blood cell in the intensive care unit. METHODS: The clinical history of the patients admitted in the intensive care unit were analyzed, revisiting which had have red blood cell transfusion in the period between January 1st 2005 and December 31 2005. The study was accepted by the Research Ethics Committee - Comite de Etica em Pesquisa (CEP) - of the University of South of Santa Catarina (UNISUL). RESULTS: The transfusion rate was 19,33, and the majority of the patients were of the male gender. Their age prevalence was of 60 years old or older. The mortality rate among patients who under went red blood cell transfusion died was of 38,22%. The transfusions criterias were low serum hemoglobin (78%) and the hemoglobin pre - transfusion was 8,11 g/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Politrauma and sepsis/sepsis chock were the pre diagnosis criteria. A low hemoglobin level is the main clinical criteria with average hemoglobin pre - transfusion was 8,11 g/dL."
31815650,Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).,2019,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk for developing Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). Risk factors predicting their mortality or standardized treatment recommendations have not been defined for this cohort. Our goal is to determine outcome and mortality associated risk factors for patients at the ICU with CDI by evaluating clinical characteristics and therapy regimens. METHODS: A retrospective single-centre cohort study. One hundred forty-four patients (0.4%) with CDI-associated diarrhoea were included (total 36.477 patients admitted to 12 ICUs from January 2010 to September 2015). Eight patients without specific antibiotic therapy were excluded, so 132 patients were analysed regarding mortality, associated risk factors and therapy regimens using univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Twenty-eight-day mortality was high in patients diagnosed with CDI (27.3%) compared to non-infected ICU patients (9%). Patients with non CDI-related sepsis (n = 40/132; 30.3%) showed further increase in 28-day mortality (45%; p = 0.003). Initially, most patients were treated with a single CDI-specific agent (n = 120/132; 90.9%), either metronidazole (orally, 35.6%; or IV, 37.1%) or vancomycin (18.2%), or with a combination of antibiotics (n = 12/132; 9.1%). Patients treated with metronidazole IV showed significantly longer duration of diarrhoea > 5 days (p = 0.006). In a multivariate regression model, metronidazole IV as initial therapy was an independent risk factor for delayed clinical cure. Immunosuppressants (p = 0.007) during ICU stay lead to increased 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Treatment of CDI with solely metronidazole IV leads to a prolonged disease course in critically ill patients."
41470207,Prognostic Factors for Mortality in Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections Among Hemodialysis Patients: A Prospective Single-Center Study.,2025,"Background and Objectives: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a major life-threatening complication among patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) through central venous catheters. This study was performed to determine mortality risk factors in HD patients with CRBSI. Materials and Methods: Data were collected prospectively from patients with CRBSI using central venous catheters as HD access between November 2022 and November 2023. A total of 60 patients were evaluated with respect to age, sex, catheter dwell time, insertion site, comorbidities, and a range of clinical findings. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Risk factors were assessed through univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: The median age of the patients was 63 years, and 56.9% were male. The in-hospital mortality rate among the HD patients with CRBSI was 15%. Gram-positive microorganisms were responsible for 55.6% of the cases resulting in mortality. The following factors were associated with mortality: multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, the presence of a non-tunneled catheter, concomitant pyocystitis, elevated C-reactive protein, qSOFA >/= 2, and altered consciousness. In multivariate logistic regression, MDR microorganisms, concomitant pyocystitis, and qSOFA >/= 2 remained significant independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: Our findings show that the above factors may be useful in predicting mortality in HD patients with CRBSI. Awareness of these factors and prompt intervention can help reduce mortality."
41494198,Plasma apolipoprotein E levels and sepsis risk based on multi-center cohorts and multi-omics validation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care, with limited reliable biomarkers that reflect upstream pathophysiology and enable early risk stratification. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter with immune-regulatory functions, has shown inconsistent associations with sepsis outcomes. Its causal and clinically actionable role in sepsis risk requires clarification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a multi-layered strategy integrating Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and phenome-wide association studies across five large proteogenomic cohorts (>500,000 individuals) to identify plasma proteins causally linked to sepsis. ApoE emerged as a top candidate and was validated in a clinical cohort of 291 ICU patients and in murine sepsis models. We assessed the relationship between ApoE levels and sepsis risk using logistic regression, restricted cubic spline models, and survival analyses, and explored underlying mechanisms via cytokine profiling, histopathology, and transcriptomics. RESULTS: ApoE was causally associated with sepsis risk in multiple independent datasets, supported by strong genetic colocalization (posterior probability for shared causal variant PP.H4 > 0.80). In ICU patients, both low (adjusted OR 12.74, 95% CI 5.72-28.36) and high ApoE levels (adjusted OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.25-9.16) were independently associated with increased sepsis risk compared to medium levels, forming a significant U-shaped pattern (P_nonlinear < 0.001). This biphasic risk was mirrored in murine models, where both hypo- and hyper-expression of ApoE aggravated systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality. LDL cholesterol mediated only ~ 20% of the ApoE-sepsis association, indicating lipid-independent mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Plasma ApoE functions as a biphasic, dose-sensitive modulator of host response to sepsis. Both deficiency and excess disturb immune homeostasis and increase susceptibility, underscoring the need for precision-guided ApoE modulation in sepsis management. These findings provide a mechanistically grounded biomarker candidate and highlight new avenues for personalized therapy. Prospective trials are warranted to evaluate ApoE-targeted strategies in sepsis care."
25525390,Sepsis in Canadian children: a national analysis using administrative data.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Severe infection resulting in sepsis is recognized as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The purpose of this study is to use longitudinal, population-based data to report national-level hospital metrics, providing a current assessment of the status of sepsis hospitalizations in Canadian children. METHODS: We performed an analysis of previously abstracted data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Children aged 0-17 years at the time of hospital admission were identified from a cohort of patients with sepsis or severe sepsis using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10-CA) and the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI). Descriptive population-based statistics are reported. RESULTS: Hospitalization data for 20,130 children admitted over 5 years were reviewed. The majority of children were young, with neonates (56.3%) and infants under 2 months (18.8%) representing the majority of cases. A decline in age-adjusted hospitalization rates was demonstrated in both overall and non-severe sepsis across the study period; however, no change was demonstrated for severe sepsis. While overall in-hospital crude mortality rates did not change significantly across the study period (range 5.1%-5.4%), a significant decrease was found in children aged 3-23 months and adolescents. Multi-organ failure was reported in more than one-quarter of children with severe sepsis. Odds of mortality increased significantly with number of organs failed. CONCLUSION: Sepsis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Canadian children, posing a significant burden on health care resources. Age continues to be associated with the incidence and severity of illness. Overall hospitalization rates have declined over time, as has mortality in severe sepsis. This report provides baseline metrics for future outcome-based research in Canada targeting prevention strategies and early diagnosis, as well as therapies preventing and managing organ failure."
31814600,Surgical management of acute diverticulitis. An update based on our experience and literature data.,2019,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of acute diverticulitis is a matter of debate and has undergone significant changes. Currently the main focus of surgical treatment is a more conservative and less invasive management. AIMS AND METHODS: To focus the role of surgery in the treatment of acute diverticulitis, the Authors have conducted a review of the literature of the last two decades and have revised critically their own experience. RESULTS: The indications for elective surgery based on the number of episodes, the young age at diagnosis and the presence of risk factors such as immunosuppression, have to be overcome in favour of a more individual approach based on the severity of the disease. Similarly the presence of pneumoperitoneum is no longer a compelling indication for urgent surgery just as it was in the past. In the treatment of complicated diverticulitis with abscess (Hinchey I-II) is used more and more conservative treatments consisting of guided percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotics. Resection with primary anastomosis with or without diverting ileostomy is preferable to Hartmann's procedure in case of perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis (Hinchey III-IV), using the latter only in the case of comorbidities, severe sepsis, hemodynamic instability or longtime feculent peritonitis (Hinchey IV). Recently, laparoscopic peritoneal lavage was introduced in the treatment of diverticulitis. CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the progress made in conservative and interventional treatment and laparoscopic surgery, an increasingly less invasive treatment is proposed in the management of acute diverticulitis. KEY WORDS: Acute diverticulitis, Laparoscopic surgery, Surgical treatment."
25498125,Methylglyoxal as a new biomarker in patients with septic shock: an observational clinical study.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: The role of reactive carbonyl species, such as methylglyoxal (MG), has been overlooked within the context of the sepsis syndrome. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of MG formation in different inflammatory settings and to evaluate its use for early diagnosis as well as prognosis of the sepsis syndrome. METHODS: In total, 120 patients in three groups were enrolled in this observational clinical pilot study. The three groups included patients with septic shock (n = 60), postoperative controls (n = 30), and healthy volunteers (n = 30). Plasma samples from patients with septic shock were collected at sepsis onset and after 24 hours and 4, 7, 14, and 28 days. Plasma samples from postoperative controls were collected prior to surgery, immediately following the end of the surgical procedure as well as 24 hours later and from healthy volunteers once. Plasma levels of MG were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, plasma levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, soluble CD14 subtype, and interleukin-6 were determined. RESULTS: Patients with septic shock showed significantly higher plasma levels of MG at all measured times, compared with postoperative controls. MG was found to identify patients with septic shock more effectively-area under the curve (AUC): 0.993-than procalcitonin (AUC: 0.844), C-reactive protein (AUC: 0.791), soluble CD14 subtype (AUC: 0.832), and interleukin-6 (AUC: 0.898) as assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Moreover, plasma levels of MG in non-survivors were significantly higher than in survivors (sepsis onset: *P = 0.018 for 90-day survival; **P = 0.008 for 28-day survival). Plasma levels of MG proved to be an early predictor for survival in patients with septic shock (sepsis onset: ROC-AUC 0.710 for 28-day survival; ROC-AUC 0.686 for 90-day survival). CONCLUSIONS: MG was identified as a marker for monitoring the onset, development, and remission of sepsis and was found to be more useful than routine diagnostic markers. Further studies are required to determine the extent of MG modification in sepsis and whether targeting this pathway could be therapeutically beneficial to the patient.

21884342,Late-onset graft-versus-host disease after pediatric living-related liver transplantation for Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,2011,"GVHD is the most common and well-known cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic BM transplantation. The GVHD following OLT is an uncommon complication but has a high mortality and poses a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We herein discussed a 12-month-old girl with multi-system LCH, who developed end-stage liver disease despite intensive chemotherapy. She underwent ABO-compatible liver transplantation at 28 months while in remission from LCH. The donor was her 26-yr-old father. Post-operative course was uneventful. The GVHD manifested with skin rash and BM suppression on post-transplant day 94 and confirmed by both microchimerism and skin biopsy. Prednisolone, basiliximab, and ATG were administered immediately but the bone marrow suppression was not improved and the patient died because of Candida sepsis at six-month post-transplant. GVHD after OLT should be keep in mind in patients with rash and BM suppression after liver transplantation. In LDLT, a patient who carries risk factors should investigated for optimal HLA matching."
15829287,Toll-like receptor mRNA expression patterns in human dendritic cells and monocytes.,2005,"The innate immune system recognises a wide spectrum of pathogens without a need for prior exposure. The main cells responsible are monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) and neutrophils phagocytose microbial pathogens triggering a cytokine network resulting in the development of inflammatory and specific immune responses. Findings in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, initially discovered in Drosophila, further elucidated these processes. Toll-like receptors induce activation of an innate immune response and at present ten TLRs have been identified, named TLRs 1-10. In addition to the ignition of the innate immune response, evidence implicates the TLR family in a spectrum of systemic disorders following bacterial infections including sepsis and multiple organ failure, and can be detrimental, leading to tissue injury. In this project, our main goal was to investigate the effects of a TLR4 ligand, lipolysaccharide (LPS) in human DC and monocytes. Our hypothesis is that different professional APCs, express different mRNA TLR transcripts. Our findings indicate that TLR expression patterns change in relation to the pathogen involved and in the case of DC, and the maturation stage the latter are upon challenging. Our results and interpretation showed significant alteration of transcript expression patterns upon LPS challenge in all cell subsets, with DC subsets expressing different TLR mRNA patterns as they go through different maturation stages."
41525335,Role of Sepsis Markers as Potential Biomarkers for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"GOALS: This study aimed to investigate whether sepsis markers act as biomarkers of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). BACKGROUND: The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is advantageous. This prospective observational study investigated whether the sepsis markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), presepsin (PSEP), procalcitonin (PCT), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), act as biomarkers of UC and CD. STUDY: Patients with UC or CD underwent endoscopy and assessment of the abovementioned sepsis markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leucine-rich alpha 2 glycoprotein (LRG). We prospectively examined the association of these markers with clinical activity and endoscopic scores, including the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with UC and 49 patients with CD were enrolled. MES significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in patients with UC. SES-CD significantly correlated with LRG, CRP, IL-6, and PTX3 in patients with CD. In UC, MES to 3 groups showed significantly higher LRG, CRP, and IL-6 levels than the MES 0 to 1 groups. The LRG, CRP, IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 levels were significantly higher in the SES-CD >/=3 group than in the SES-CD </=2 group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 in UC and IL-6, PSEP, and PTX3 in CD are potential biomarkers. Overall, our findings could promote better management of IBD."
25533744,[Chlamydia trachomaatis DNA in leukocytes of peripheral blood from neonates].,2015,"INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in newborns is difficult; however, this diagnosis is performed by cell culture or by detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis. Detection of C. trachomatis DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes using polymer chain reaction (PCR) may be a better tool for the diagnosis of infection by this pathogen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 premature newborns, all weighing less than 2500g, were included in the study. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal lavages were obtained from each newborn. Leukocyte DNA was obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction technique. Detection of C. trachomatis was performed by amplifying the ompA gene using the PCR endpoint. Cell culture tests and the detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis by microimmunofluorescence assay were also performed. RESULTS: Twenty newborns were PCR-positive (45.5%), with this test being significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (RR=2.28; 95%CI: 1.01 to 5.17; P=.035). The cell culture of nasopharyngeal lavage was positive in only 7 samples and no significant association was observed with any clinical or laboratory data. The titer of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis associated with PCR-positive was 1:32 (RR=2.74; 95%CI: 1.21 to 6.23; P=.008), however this titer was not associated with the presence of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: DNA detection in peripheral blood leukocytes could be useful for diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection."
25595251,Sepsis progression to multiple organ dysfunction in carotid chemo/baro-denervated rats treated with lipopolysaccharide.,2015,"Sepsis progresses to multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) due to the uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators. Carotid chemo/baro-receptors could play a protective role during sepsis. In anesthetized male rats, we measured cardiorespiratory variables and plasma TNF-alpha, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and MOD marker levels 90min after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in control (SHAM surgery) and bilateral carotid chemo/baro-denervated (BCN) rats. BCN prior to LPS blunted the tachypneic response and enhanced tachycardia and hypotension. BCN-LPS rats also showed blunted plasma glucocorticoid responses, boosted epinephrine and TNF-alpha responses, and earlier MOD onset with a lower survival time compared with SHAM-LPS rats. Consequently, the complete absence of carotid chemo/baro-sensory function modified the neural, endocrine and inflammatory responses to sepsis. Thus, carotid chemo/baro-receptors play a protective role in sepsis."

All the treatments were able to prolong survival and to reduce the tissue burden in the spleen and kidneys of infected mice. Neither voriconazole nor posaconazole improved the results achieved with amphotericin B."
41437584,[Alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites of sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome based on 16S rDNA and untargeted metabolomics sequencing analysis].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of gut microbiota and metabolites between sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by using 16S rDNA and untargeted metabolomics sequencing analysis. METHODS: Patients with sepsis admitted to general intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2024 to May 2024 were enrolled. They were divided into ARDS group and non-ARDS group according to whether ARDS was present at admission. Clinical data were collected, and the fecal samples within 24 hours after diagnosis of sepsis were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. The denoised sequences amplicon sequence variants were used for diversity analysis, species composition analysis and species difference analysis. The fecal samples were performed for untargeted metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to screen for differential metabolites and related pathways. Finally, the joint analysis of differential gut microbiota and metabolites was conducted. RESULTS: Finally, 38 sepsis patients were included, including 15 cases with concomitant ARDS. Compared with the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group had significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), and C-reactive protein level. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that at the phylum level, the ARDS group was mainly composed of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota, while the non-ARDS group was mainly composed of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobiota. At the genus level, the ARDS group was mainly composed of Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, while the non-ARDS group was mainly composed of Enterococcus, Akkermansia and Ligilactobacillus. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the abundance of Klebsiella and Anaerofilum in the ARDS group significantly increased, while the abundance of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Akkermansia and Ruminococcus in the ARDS group significantly decreased. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the levels of metabolites such as nicotinamide N-oxide, uridine and N-acetyl-arginine were significantly up-regulated in the ARDS group, while the levels of metabolites such as lysine, ornithine, N-acetylaspartic acid and alanylalanine were significantly down-regulated in the ARDS group. The metabolic pathway analysis showed that compared with the non-ARDS group, the differentially expressed metabolites in the ARDS group were mainly enriched in the pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, lysinedegradation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. The joint analysis indicated that Klebsiella were positively correlated with metabolites such as nicotinamide N-oxide and N-acetyl-arginine. Enterococcus were positively correlated with metabolites such as lysine and ornithine, and negatively correlated with nicotinamide N-oxide. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of beneficial bacteria in the gut of sepsis patients with ARDS further decreased, while the abundance of opportunistic pathogens further increased, which in turn affected the levels of related metabolites."
25537308,Medium-Term Outcomes Following Endovascular Repair of Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms with an Unfavourable Proximal Neck.,2015,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate medium-term outcomes following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) with unfavourable neck anatomy using stent grafts with a 36 mm or larger proximal diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 27 patients who underwent elective EVAR between 2006 and 2008 using a stent graft with a 36 mm or larger proximal diameter was carried out. All patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) for procedure planning, and detailed assessment of the aneurysm neck was performed using a three-dimensional CTA workstation. Patients were followed up with CTA at 3 and 12 months and annual duplex thereafter. RESULTS: The median aneurysm diameter was 7 cm, and the median aneurysm neck diameter was 31 mm. Cook Zenith stent grafts were used in all patients, with a proximal diameter of 36 mm (n = 25) and 40 mm (n = 2). Primary and assisted primary technical success rates were 74 and 93%, respectively. The follow-up period ranged from 62 to 84 months, with a median of 72 months. 15 patients died during follow-up. Two patients died from aortic rupture, and the remaining patients died from cardiac disease (n = 4), chest sepsis (n = 6), cancer (n = 2) and renal failure (n = 1). Complications included type I endoleak (n = 5), limb occlusion (n = 2), limb stenosis (n = 2), limb kinking (n = 1), dissection of an artery (n = 1), occlusion of a femorofemoral cross-over graft (n = 1) and poor attachment of a distal limb (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: EVAR using stent grafts in the presence of an unfavourable neck has a high risk of complications. Medium-term survival in this group is low but mainly due to patient co-morbidities."
15700667,[The detection of Brucella spp by BACTEC 9050 blood culture system].,2004,"Recent reports have demonstrated that automated continous monitoring blood culture systems are fast and efficent in the detection of Brucella spp. In this retrospective study, the detection of these slow-growing bacteria by BACTEC 9050 blood culture system was evaluated. For this purpose, 60 patients, whose blood cultures were monitored by using BACTEC 9050 system were included into the study. Brucella spp. were isolated in 26 of 31 patients from whom two blood cultures were obtained and in 17 of 29 patients from whom single blood culture were obtained. The majority of isolates (84.1%) were detected within 7 days of incubation while the earliest detection was on the 3rd day in two samples. However, the bacteria were isolated by subcultures after 30 days of incubation in 8 of the samples. In conclusion, the routine 5 or 7 days-incubation protocols with BACTEC 9050 system were not efficient for the isolation of Brucella spp. Obtaining two blood cultures and prolonged incubation followed by subcultures increased the probability of bacterial isolation."
19957797,[Evaluation of clinical effects on low-dose heparin therapy for sepsis].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of low-dose heparin on sepsis. METHODS: Seventy-nine sepsis patients were randomly divided into two groups: heparin treatment group (n = 37) and routine treatment group (n = 42). The 7-day and 28-day mortality, the days in ICU and the length of stay, the changes of oxygenation index, the days of mechanical ventilation and the rates of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure (ARF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were observed. The levels of APTT, PT and platelet (PLT) count were determined before and after treatment in two groups. RESULTS: The rates of DIC, ARF and MODS in heparin group decreased significantly after therapy: rate of DIC, 15.4% vs 38.7% (P = 0.03); rate of ARF, 25.0% vs 51.9% (P = 0.04); rate of MODS, 26.3% vs 50.0% (P = 0.04). In heparin group, the 28-day mortality was statistically reduced (15.4% vs 32.4%, P = 0.03). The differences between heparin group and routine group were not statistically significant in the 7-day mortality (7.7% vs 12.9%, P = 0.08), the days in ICU (Z = 0.281, P = 0.779, rank sum test), the length of stay (Z = 0.562, P = 0.574, rank sum test), the oxygenation index (P = 0.82), the days of mechanical ventilation [(126.07 +/- 166.21) h vs (179.27 +/- 221.7) h, P = 0.28] and the rate of ARDS (44.0% vs 46.2%, P = 0.88). The differences in APTT, PT and PLT were not significant between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Low-dose heparin can decrease the mortality rate of sepsis and improve the prognosis of patients. It is a safe promising therapy in sepsis patients without severe side effects."
25520842,Post-marketing surveillance data of thrombomodulin alfa: sub-analysis in patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Thrombomodulin alfa (TM-alpha, recombinant thrombomodulin) significantly improved disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) when compared with heparin therapy in a phase III study. Post-marketing surveillance of TM-alpha was performed to evaluate the effects and safety in patients with sepsis-induced DIC. METHODS: From May 2008 to April 2010, a total of 1,787 patients with sepsis-induced DIC treated with TM-alpha were registered. DIC was diagnosed based on the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) criteria. The DIC resolution and survival rates on day 28 after the last TM-alpha administration, and changes in DIC, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and coagulation and inflammation markers were evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequent underlying disease was infectious focus-unknown sepsis (29.8%). The mean +/- SD values of age, dose, and the duration of TM-alpha administration were 64.7 +/- 20.3 years, 297.3 +/- 111.4 U/kg/day, and 5.6 +/- 3.4 days, respectively. A total of 1,320 subjects (73.9%) received combined administration with other anticoagulants. Both coagulation and inflammation markers, such as fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, prothrombin time ratio, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and C-reactive protein, as well as JAAM DIC, SIRS, and SOFA scores, significantly and simultaneously decreased after TM-alpha administration (p < 0.001). DIC resolution and 28-day survival rates were 44.4% and 66.0%, respectively. The 28-day survival rate decreased significantly according to the duration of DIC before TM-alpha administration (p < 0.001). Total adverse drug reactions (ADRs), bleeding ADRs, and serious bleeding adverse events occurred in 126 (7.1%), 98 (5.5%), and 121 (6.8%) subjects, respectively. On day 28, after the last TM-alpha administration available for an antibody test, only one patient was positive for anti-TM-alpha antibodies (0.11%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TM-alpha is most effective for treating patients with sepsis-induced DIC when administered within the first 3 days after diagnosis."
32317149,Bacterial infections in cirrhosis: Current treatment.,2020,Bacterial infections frequently cause decompensating events in cirrhotic patients and are also the most common factor identified for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The increase in the prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms has resulted in the reduced effectiveness of empiric antimicrobial treatment. We conducted a PubMed search from the last 20 years using the Keywords cirrhosis; multidrug-resistant; infections; diagnosis; treatment; prophylaxis; monitoring; sepsis; nutrition and antibiotic resistant. We made a review about bacterial infections among cirrhotic patients; we mainly focus on the description of diagnostic tools; biomarkers; clinical scores for diagnosis and prognosis also; we made an analysis concerning the monitoring of cirrhotic patients with sepsis and finally made some recommendations about the treatment; prophylaxis and prevention.
25527687,Epidural abscess secondary to acute appendicitis.,2014,"A 62-year-old man presented via the emergency department with a 1-week history of back pain, on a background of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and rectal carcinoma for which he had undergone abdominoperineal resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He exhibited signs of sepsis, midline lumbar spine tenderness and reduced hip flexion. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a presacral collection contiguous with the tip of the appendix, and MRI lumbar spine revealed abscess invation into the epidural space extending to T9. He underwent a laparotomy with washout of the presacral abscess and appendicectomy and prolonged course intravenous antibiotic therapy. At 3 months after initial presentation he had made a full clinical recovery with progressive radiological resolution of the epidural abscess. The objective of the case report is to highlight a unique and clinically significant complication of a very common pathology (appendicitis) and to briefly discuss other intra-abdominal sources of epidural abscess."
15707713,Neonatal thrombocytopenia.,2005,"Thrombocytopenia occurs in up to a third of preterm neonates admitted to intensive care units. In these babies, thrombocytopenia typically presents in one of two patterns: early-onset thrombocytopenia occurring within 72 h of birth and late-onset thrombocytopenia which develops after 72 h. Early-onset thrombocytopenia is most commonly caused by disorders associated with placental insufficiency (e.g. maternal hypertension), is mild-moderate, self-limiting and requires no treatment; it is caused by reduced platelet production. Late-onset thrombocytopenia is usually due to bacterial sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis; it is often severe (platelets <50 x 10(9)/l), prolonged and requires treatment with platelet transfusions. In term babies, neonatal thrombocytopenia is usually severe and most commonly caused by bacterial sepsis, perinatal asphyxia or neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia. The most important future developments will depend upon studies aimed at determining optimal platelet transfusion schedules for term and preterm neonates."
25503387,Suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis through toll-like receptor 4-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in endotoxin-induced acute kidney injury.,2015,"Although disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis and biogenesis (MB) is a widely accepted pathophysiologic feature of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are unknown. In this study, we examined the signaling pathways responsible for the suppression of MB in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI. Downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a master regulator of MB, was noted at the mRNA level at 3 hours and protein level at 18 hours in the renal cortex, and was associated with loss of renal function after LPS treatment. LPS-mediated suppression of PGC-1alpha led to reduced expression of downstream regulators of MB and electron transport chain proteins along with a reduction in renal cortical mitochondrial DNA content. Mechanistically, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice were protected from renal injury and disruption of MB after LPS exposure. Immunoblot analysis revealed activation of tumor progression locus 2/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (TPL-2/MEK/ERK) signaling in the renal cortex by LPS. Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling attenuated renal dysfunction and loss of PGC-1alpha, and was associated with a reduction in proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1beta) expression at 3 hours after LPS exposure. Neutralization of TNF-alpha also blocked PGC-1alpha suppression, but not renal dysfunction, after LPS-induced AKI. Finally, systemic administration of recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha alone was sufficient to produce AKI and disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis. These findings indicate an important role for the TLR4/MEK/ERK pathway in both LPS-induced renal dysfunction and suppression of MB. TLR4/MEK/ERK/TNF-alpha signaling may represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and AKI produced by sepsis."
32284723,Pregnancy-induced haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,2020,"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an aggressive and life-threatening syndrome of excessive immune activation. It is associated with various aetiologies, including infections, collagen vascular diseases and malignancies. Pregnancy-induced immune dysregulation in genetically susceptible women may also play a critical role in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Our case involves that of a 23-year-old pregnant woman who presented at 22 weeks gestation with tachycardia, swinging pyrexia, rigors and generalised myalgia. Refractory hypotension to intravenous fluids and rise in lactate level required admission to the intensive care unit for vasopressor support. Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed sepsis, she made little clinical improvement. Investigations for infection and rheumatological disease were unremarkable. A pronounced hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and cytopenia raised the suspicion of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Subsequent elevated CD25 levels helped establish the diagnosis. Treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin provided a transient response in regard to temperature control and cardiovascular stability. The decision was made to treat her with anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. She responded well to this with a complete resolution of her symptoms and normalisation of her ferritin levels over the course of some weeks. Because of progressive slowing of foetal growth and abnormal umbilical artery Dopplers and cardiotocography, she eventually had an emergency caesarean section at 31 + 5 weeks. There were no foetal abnormalities."
41668730,Exploring the association between dexmedetomidine and all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis through propensity score matching analysis and machine learning algorithms: a MIMIC-IV retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis carries high ICU mortality globally, often requiring sedated mechanical ventilation. While some studies suggest dexmedetomidine improves survival in these patients, others contradict this finding. This study evaluates dexmedetomidine's survival benefit and sedation value for ventilated sepsis cases. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the MIMIC-IV database and eICU-CRD to analyze mechanically ventilated septic patients. Propensity score matching was employed to balance covariates. Machine learning algorithms were applied to validate dexmedetomidine's role in predicting mortality. RESULTS: A propensity score matching analysis was performed for 5176 pairs of patients. The use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (13.39% vs. 19.84%, HR: 0.595, P < 0.001) and of 180-day all-cause mortality (17.45% vs. 23.18%, HR: 0.632, P < 0.001). However, dexmedetomidine use was also associated with longer hospital (median 15.08 days vs. 10.2 days, P < 0.001) and ICU stays (median 6.81 days vs. 4.0 days, P < 0.001). Moreover, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in the dexmedetomidine group (median 78 h vs. 51.00 h, P < 0.001). Dexmedetomidine was included among the significant features identified with the Boruta algorithm, and of the five machine learning models built using the 20 most important features (including dexmedetomidine), the model constructed on the basis of the Random Forest algorithm performed the best (training set: AUC = 0.781; test set: AUC = 0.811; eICU-CRD set: AUC = 0.820). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that comorbid acute kidney injury (AKI) was the most important predictor of mortality among mechanically ventilated septic patients. This was followed by the use of opioids, PaO(2), and the SOFA score, with the use of dexmedetomidine relatively closely behind. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine use significantly reduces short-term mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis but prolongs the hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and duration of mechanical ventilation. Administering dexmedetomidine within 48 hours and maintaining an infusion rate at or below 0.6 mug/kg/h appears to be more beneficial. Moreover, dexmedetomidine use strongly influences mortality in these patients."
41471193,"Retrospective Evaluation of the Incidence, Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Patients with hematologic malignancies are highly vulnerable to Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections (GNB-BSIs) due to underlying disease-related immunosuppression, intensive chemotherapy, and repeated invasive interventions, rendering these infections a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features of GNB-BSIs in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies, and to compare clinical and microbiological factors between survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary university hospital hematology ward in Turkiye, including adult patients diagnosed with BSIs due to Gram-negative bacteria between January 2005 and December 2024. Demographic characteristics, microbiological profiles, antimicrobial resistance rates, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. We compared survivors and non-survivors to determine differences in clinical and microbiological characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 321 patients with hematologic malignancies experienced 441 episodes of GNB-BSIs. The median age was 46 years, and 59% of them were male. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (53.3%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.6%) and Pseudomonas spp. (7.5%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (ESBL/3GCR) and carbapenem-resistant isolates were observed in 21.1% and 13.3% of isolates, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 26.5%. ICU admission, multidrug resistance, and persistent bacteremia were observed more often among non-survivors. Additionally, prolonged fever duration (median 8 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001), elevated CRP (p = 0.001), and higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.046) were detected in non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematologic malignancies, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. remain the predominant pathogens causing bloodstream infections, while persistent bacteremia, ESBL/3GCR, and carbapenem resistance are associated with higher mortality. Notably, carbapenem resistance showed a temporal increase over the study period, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance and timely adaptation of empirical treatment strategies."
25504251,[Nasal CPAP versus mechanical ventilation in 28 to 32-week preterm infants with early surfactant administration].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is useful in low birth weight infants with respiratory distress, but it is not known if it is a better alternative to mechanical ventilation after early pulmonary surfactant administration. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of adverse events in 28 to 32-week newborns with respiratory distress managed with mechanical ventilation or CPAP after early surfactant administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 176 newborns were treated with CPAP and 147 with mechanical ventilation, all with Apgar scores >3 at five minutes and without apnea. RESULTS: The incidence of CPAP failure was 6.5% (95% CI: 11.3-22.8%); 29 patients died: 7 with CPAP (4.0%) and 22 with mechanical ventilation (15.0%, p<0.001). The relative risk of dying with CPAP versus mechanical ventilation was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.12-0.61), but after adjusting for confounding factors, CPAP use did not imply a higher risk of dying (RR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.29-1.24). Mechanical ventilation fatality rate was 5.70 (95% CI: 3.75-8.66) deaths/1,000 days-patient, while with CPAP it was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.65-2.88, p<0.001). Chronic lung disease incidence was lower with CPAP than with mechanical ventilation (RR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96), as were intracranial hemorrhage (RR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.84) and sepsis (RR=0.67; 95%CI: 0.52-0.86), and it was similar for air leaks (RR=2.51; 95% CI: 0.83-7.61) and necrotizing enterocolitis (RR=1.68, 95% CI: 0.59-4.81). CONCLUSION: CPAP exposure of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome is protective against chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage and sepsis compared to mechanical ventilation. No differences were observed regarding air leak syndrome or death."
15754642,[Meningococcal meningitis--familial outbreak].,2004,"Severe infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis, clinically appearing as meningitis or sepsis, are constantly noted in developed countries, including Poland. Because of rapid clinical course and mortality rate they continue to pose a serious clinical problem. Most cases are sporadic ones, caused by the contact with a healthy carrier of N. meningitidis. Familial and group outbreaks are rare, being responsible for about 1% of cases. However, in family members of patients with meningococcal infection the risk of developing the disease during the following week is about one hundred times higher than in the general population and they should receive an antibiotic prophylaxis. We describe a familial outbreak of meningococcal meningitis with typical clinical features, which appeared in two members of a family during the same day, with a case of acute pharyngitis most likely of the same etiology in the third person, a child. In that instance, practically simultaneous appearance of consecutive cases gave no time for prophylaxis. However, suspicion of meningococcal disease in the first patient contributed to the prompt hospitalization and diagnostics and proper treatment in the two following cases."
31826003,On-site blood culture incubation shortens the time to knowledge of positivity and microbiological results in septic patients.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: To determine whether on-site incubation of blood cultures at the intensive care unit (ICU) improves not only the time to incubation but also time to positivity, time to knowledge of positivity and time to results (identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing). METHODS: This observational single-centre study in ICU patients with severe sepsis and septic shock investigated the impact of blood culture incubation immediately on-site at the ICU (ICU group) by comparison with traditional processing in a remote laboratory (LAB group) on different time intervals of blood culture diagnostics from obtaining blood to clinician notification of final result. The effect of on-site incubation was evaluated in Kaplan-Meier estimates for the time to positivity, time to knowledge of positivity and time to microbiological results and a linear mixed model was built. RESULTS: A total of 3,549 blood culture sets from 657 ICU patients were analysed: 2,381 in the LAB group and 1,168 in the ICU group. Overall, 660 (18.6%) blood culture sets were positive and 2,889 (81.4%) sets remained negative. On-site incubation was associated with reduced time to knowledge of positivity (46.9 h [CI 43.4-50.8 h] vs. 28.0 h [CI 23.6-32.2 h], p < 0.001) and reduced time to result (61.4 h [CI 58.4-64.8 h] vs. 42.1 h [CI 39.1-47.5 h], p < 0.001). In blood cultures processed instantaneously at the ICU compared to incubation in the remote laboratory within 4 h, the time to microbiological result was significantly reduced by 8.5 h (p < 0.001). Pre-existing anti-infective therapy had no significant impact on diagnostic time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Instantaneous incubation of blood cultures in the ICU compared to incubation in a remote laboratory significantly improves time to knowledge to positivity and time to result. These effects are even more pronounced during off-hours of the microbiological laboratory. The results underline the importance of 24/7 diagnostics to provide round-the-clock processing of blood culture samples in patients with sepsis and septic shock and an immediate to communication of the results to the clinicians."
41500684,[Development and evaluation of a risk prediction model for sepsis-associated liver injury in the intensive care unit].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate independent risk factors for sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis, establish an effective risk prediction model, and validate it. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using patients diagnosed with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC- IV) v2.2 database. Patients were divided into SALI and non-SALI groups based on the occurrence of SALI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, infection sites, vital signs upon ICU admission, initial laboratory parameters within 24 hours of ICU admission, treatment interventions, 24-hour urine output, disease severity scores, and prognostic indicators collected and compared between the two groups. The entire cohort was divided into training and validation sets using a 7 : 3 random sampling ratio. Independent risk factors for SALI occurrence were identified in the training set using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Based on this, a risk prediction model was constructed and presented as a nomogram. Model performance was evaluated in both training and validation sets. Predictive capability was assessed using receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), model calibration was determined via calibration curves, and net benefit was evaluated through decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The final cohort included 8 549 sepsis patients, comprising 1 067 in the SALI group and 7 482 in the non-SALI group. Significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding gender, type of ICU admission, hypertension, organ failure status, site of infection (bloodstream infection, pulmonary infection, abdominal infection), vital signs, and laboratory tests [white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count (PLT), albumin (Alb), total bilirubin (Tbil), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum calcium, serum potassium, serum sodium, bicarbonate, anion gap (AG), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), pH, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), lactate], therapeutic interventions [use of albumin, norepinephrine, vasopressin, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mechanical ventilation, central venous catheterization], 24-hour urine output after ICU admission, disease severity scores, and prognostic indicators were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). After regression analysis screening of these factors in the training set, eight indicators were ultimately included in the predictive model: intra-abdominal infection [odds ratio (OR) = 4.046, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 3.236-5.059, P < 0.001], vasopressin (OR = 2.188, 95%CI was 1.778-2.694, P < 0.001), CRRT (OR = 1.928, 95%CI was 1.506-2.469, P < 0.001), RDW (OR = 1.109, 95%CI was 1.069-1.151, P < 0.001), PLT (OR = 0.996, 95%CI was 0.995-0.997, P < 0.001), PT (OR = 1.042, 95%CI was 1.034-1.051, P < 0.001), lactate (OR = 1.154, 95%CI was 1.107-1.202, P < 0.001), and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA; OR = 1.119, 95%CI was 1.089-1.150, P < 0.001). ROC curves demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.830 (95%CI was 0.814-0.847) for the training set and 0.847 (95%CI was 0.825-0.869) for the validation set. Calibration curves demonstrated good agreement with the ideal curve in both the training and validation sets. DCA curve indicated that the model could effectively distinguish between patients with and without disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal infection, vasopressin, CRRT, RDW, PLT, PT, lactate, and SOFA score are independent risk factors for SALI in patients with sepsis. The SALI prediction model constructed based on these factors demonstrates certain clinical predictive value."
25550820,Neutrophil CD64 expression is a predictor of mortality for patients in the intensive care unit.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophil CD64 has been shown to be a promising biomarker for bacterial infection and sepsis identification. However, the prognostic value of CD64 in predicting the likelihood of survival for patients in intensive care unit (ICU) is unclear. METHODS: A total of 797 patients in the ICU of Xin-Hua Hospital, Shanghai, China were enrolled. We determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores from these patients and collected blood samples to measure the levels of neutrophil CD64, thyroid hormone and C-reactive protein (CRP). We assessed the association between APACHE II scores or these biomarkers and mortality of patients in the ICU. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each indicator was determined. RESULTS: The AUC for CD64 was 0.752 +/- 0.026, which was higher than that of FT3 (0.696 +/- 0.028) and CRP (0.672 +/- 0.026). APACHE II scores had the highest AUC (0.872 +/- 0.018). The level of neutrophil CD64 expression positively associated with CRP and APACHE II, and negatively correlated with FT3. Multiple regression analysis revealed that APACHE II scores (Standard beta value = 0.183, P < 0.001), CD64 (Standard beta value = 0.518, P < 0.001) or log (CRP) (Standard beta value = 1.203, P < 0.001) independently predicted ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: CD64 had the greatest power for predicting ICU mortality other than APACHE II scores. This result indicates that CD64 may be used as a biomarker to in combination with the use of APACHE II scores to improve the accuracy of predicting mortality outcome for patients in the ICU."
31826901,Surgical-site mucormycosis infection in a solid-organ transplant recipient and a concise review of the literature.,2019,"Surgical-site mucormycosis infections in solid-organ transplant recipients are rare conditions, with only 15 previously reported cases. We describe a case of a 49-year-old man who received a liver transplant due to alcoholic cirrhosis. On postoperative day 14, necrosis was noticed at the surgical site. After mucormycosis was diagnosed, monotherapy with amphotericin was started along with surgical debridements. Due to continued clinical deterioration, triple antifungal therapy was started with amphotericin, micafungin and posaconazole. Treatment with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was also started. Despite therapy, the patient expired on postoperative day 31. We review the risk factors for mucormycosis infection in solid-organ transplant recipients as well as evidence for current treatment options. We also review the 15 previously reported cases of surgical-site mucormycosis infections in solid-organ transplant recipients, including time to infection, infecting organisms, mortality and treatments."
20031896,"Reoperation for bleeding in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: incidence, risk factors, time trends, and outcomes.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Reoperation for bleeding represents an important complication in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Yet, few studies have characterized risk factors and patient outcomes of this event. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 528 686 CABG patients at >800 hospitals in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database (2004 to 2007). Clinical features and in-hospital outcomes were evaluated in patients with and without reoperation for bleeding after CABG. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of risk of this event and to estimate weights for an additive risk score. A total of 12 652 CABG patients (2.4%) required reoperation for bleeding. These rates remained fairly stable over time (2.2%, 2.3%, 2.5%, and 2.4% from 2004 to 2007, respectively). Although overall operative mortality was 4.5-fold higher in patients requiring reoperation for bleeding versus those who did not (2.0% versus 9.1%), this mortality risk declined significantly over time (11.3%, 9.5%, 8.8%, and 8.2% from 2004 to 2007, respectively, P for trend=0.0006). Factors associated with higher risk for reoperation were identified by multivariable analysis (c statistic=0.60) and summarized into a simple bedside risk score. The risk-score performed well when tested in the validation set (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Reoperation for bleeding remains an important morbid event after CABG. Nonetheless, death in patients with this complication has decreased over time. Our risk tool should allow estimation of patients risk for reoperation for bleeding and promote preventive measures when feasible in this at-risk group."
20084922,[A rare case of endocarditis due to Moraxella catarrhalis in an immunocompetent patient].,2009,"Moraxella catarrhalis is a gram-negative, catalase and oxidase positive diplococcus. While it causes otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis and conjunctivitis in children and adults, it has a tendency to cause lower respiratory tract infections in older ages. More severe clinical pictures with the range of sepsis to endocarditis are also seen in immunocompromised patients. In this report, a case of M. catarrhalis endocarditis in an immunocompetent host who needed valve replacement has been presented. Forty three years old female patient was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of fever, nausea, night sweating and arthralgia for 20 days. Physical examination revealed systolic murmurs on the apex, and vegetation on the atrial surface of mitral valve was detected by transthoracic echocardiography. Intravenous (IV) ampicillin (4 x 3 g/day) and gentamicin (3 x 80 mg/day) treatment was started empirically with prediagnosis of infective endocarditis. The treatment was modified to IV ceftriaxone (1 x 2 g/day) and gentamicin (3 x 80 mg/day) due to the reporting of gram-negative bacilli in blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux, France) on the next day. Gram-negative cocobacilli/diplococci were detected with Gram stain on the smear prepared from the blood culture bottle. Simultaneous subcultures to blood agar and eosin methylene blue agar yielded white colored, S-type, non-hemolytic colonies on only blood agar. Catalase and oxidase tests were positive, while beta-lactamase activity was negative. The isolate was identified as M. catarrhalis by using API NH (bioMerieux, France) identification strips. M. catarrhalis was isolated from five different blood culture specimens of the patient. The focus for bacteremia could not be detected. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement operation as an emergency since the vegetation exhibited rapid growth on the fifth day of medical treatment. Antibacterial therapy was completed for 6 weeks. Control echocardiography revealed that artificial mitral valve was open and functional, thus the patient recovered completely without sequela. In conclusion, M. catarrhalis should be considered as a possible cause of infective endocarditis even in immunocompetent patients."
25531650,"Olmesartan decreased levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, down-regulated MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, RANK/RANKL and up-regulated SOCs-1 in an intestinal mucositis model.",2014,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a pro-oxidant compound that depletes dihydrofolate pools and is widely used in the treatment of leukaemia and other malignancies. The efficacy of methotrexate is often limited by mucositis and intestinal injury, which are major causes of morbidity in children and adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of olmesartan (OLM), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on an Intestinal Mucositis Model (IMM) induced by MTX in Wistar rats. IMM was induced via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of MTX (7 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. The animals were pre-treated with oral OLM at 0.5, 1 or 5 mg/kg or with vehicle 30 min prior to exposure to MTX. Small intestinal homogenates were assayed for levels of the IL-1beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha cytokines, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, RANK/RANKL and SOCS-1 and confocal microscopy analysis of SOCS-1 expression were performed. Treatment with MTX + OLM (5 mg/kg) resulted in a reduction of mucosal inflammatory infiltration, ulcerations, vasodilatation and haemorrhagic areas (p<0.05) as well as reduced concentrations of MPO (p<0.001) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta (p<0.001) and TNF-a (p<0.01), and increase anti-inflammatory cytocine IL-10 (p<0.05). Additionally, the combined treatment reduced expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, RANK and RANKL(p<0.05) and increased cytoplasmic expression of SOCS-1 (p<0.05). Our findings confirm the involvement of OLM in reducing the inflammatory response through increased immunosuppressive signalling in an IMM. We also suggest that the beneficial effect of olmesartan treatment is specifically exerted during the damage through blocking inflammatory cytocines."
25617260,Adjuvant treatment with crude rhubarb for patients with systemic inflammation reaction syndrome/sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits of adjuvant treatment with crude rhubarb in patients with systemic inflammation reaction syndrome/sepsis by conducting a meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of medical electronic databases (up to October 2013). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing adjuvant treatment with crude rhubarb in septic patients were included. RESULTS: A total of 15 RCTs with 869 patients were identified. Pooled analysis showed that interleukin 6 (standardized mean differences [SMDs], -1.30; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], -1.94 to -0.66), tumor necrosis factor alpha (SMD, -0.95; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.36), procalcitonin (SMD, -1.50; 95% CI, -2.20 to -0.80), von Willebrand factor (mean differences [MDs], -144.11; 95% CI, -253.87 to -34.35), prothrombin time (MD, -2.38; 95% CI, -2.67 to -2.10), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores (MD, -4.51; 95% CI, -5.30 to -3.73), and gastrointestinal dysfunction (risk ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.49) were significantly reduced after treatment with crude rhubarb. Platelet number (MD, 58.16; 95% CI, 51.16-65.15) was significantly increased. However, crude rhubarb therapy did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality (risk ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-1.00) compared with the usual treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with crude rhubarb appears to have additional benefits in septic patients. Antiinflammation and anticoagulant/antiaggregant properties may be its potential mechanism."
41476946,Bacterial cell-free DNA profiling reveals the co-elevation of multiple bacteria in newborn foals with suspected sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, yet current diagnostics lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Here, we present a foal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing for bacterial identification (cfFBI) workflow that integrates wet-lab and computational protocols, enabling direct bacterial profiling through enrichment of the bacterial cfDNA and minimization of false-positive detections. We applied cfFBI to blood from 25 hospitalized foals and 7 healthy foals (H). Sepsis-associated bacterial genera were elevated in all 11 nSIRS-positive (S+) foals compared to H, and in 8/11 when compared to both nSIRS-negative (nS-) and H, with multiple genera elevated in nearly half (45.5%). While total cfDNA concentration, bacterial fraction, and microbial diversity did not differ between groups, S+ foals showed distinct cfDNA end-motif patterns and reduced mitochondrial cfDNA fractions. These findings indicate that cfDNA sequencing enables the detection of pathogenic bacteria and can help identify additional (host-related) sepsis biomarkers."
41458726,"Acute Compartment Syndrome: A Short Narrative Review of the Risk Factors, Complications, and Medicolegal Impact of a Missed Diagnosis.",2025,"Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a frequently encountered surgical emergency in trauma and orthopaedics. Timely diagnosis and prompt surgical fasciotomy of the involved compartments prevent complications, which can cause long-term morbidity, rehabilitation, renal failure, multiorgan failure, and even death if management is delayed or diagnosis is missed. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise existing literature on ACS, its complications, and the medicolegal impact when a diagnosis is delayed or missed. A narrative review was conducted using evidence from EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar. There is extensive literature on the diagnosis and presenting signs and symptoms of ACS. However, not the same can be said about the effect of ACS on kidney function, rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure, and death. ACS is associated with a multitude of complications and has systemic effects, including electrolyte imbalance, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Overall, ACS is one of the most common causes of litigation in trauma and orthopaedics, and care must be taken to remember that not all ACS is associated with trauma and fractures, resulting in higher rates of delayed diagnosis. To avoid litigation and morbidity to patients, timely diagnosis of ACS is essential, combined with avoiding delays to fasciotomy. Overall, ACS can cause devastating effects to patients, even without a missed diagnosis, as its complications can range from toe clawing and Volkmann contractures to muscle necrosis, which develops into sepsis and can cause multiorgan failure and death."
25527879,Risks of in-hospital death and complications after fusion surgery in patients with atlantoaxial subluxation: analysis of 1090 patients using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: To examine in-hospital mortality and postoperative major complications in patients undergoing fusion surgery for atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) and to examine whether the risk of perioperative complications varies between patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a nationwide administrative impatient database in Japan, identified 1090 patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery for AAS during 2007-2012. Patients' clinical characteristics were extracted, including age, sex, use of homologous blood transfusion, length of stay, and type of hospital. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital death and major complications, including surgical-site infection, sepsis, cardiac events, respiratory disorders, acute renal failure, pulmonary embolism, perioperative stroke, and vertebral injury. Massive blood transfusion was defined as at least 6 units of red blood cells. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-five patients (42.7%) were classified as the RA group. In-hospital mortality after fusion surgery for AAS was 0.5% (5/1090), and major complications occurred in 5% (55/1090). Multivariate analyses showed that patients with RA were more likely to have major complications after surgery than patients without RA (odds ratio: 1.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.96-2.97; P = 0.07), and the rate of massive blood transfusion was significantly greater in patients with RA than in patients without RA (odds ratio: 2.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-4.68; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality after fusion surgery for AAS was relatively low. However, patients with RA had an increased risk of postoperative complications and massive blood transfusion compared with patients without RA."
15646070,Discordant response to HAART: reduction of viremia and replicative capacity of HIV strains in patients after genotype guided change of therapy.,2004,"The aim of this study was to evaluate outcome after a genotype guided change of therapy in 18 patients failing HAART. Patients were divided into two groups according to the response to therapy: immune responders (12 patients with immune recovery defined as having more than 100 CD4 cells compared to baseline value), and 6 failing patients (without immune recovery). At month 12 after genotype change of therapy a significant difference in the decrease of HIV-RNA viral load between the two groups of patients was detected (mean -1.95 and +0.04 log HIV-RNA copies/ml, p=0.04). One year after the change of therapy, all but one patients experienced a decrease in the replication capacity of HIV strains. Particularly, the HIV replication capacity of HIV strains decreased from 52% (range 14-98%) to 15.2% (range 0.1-74.5%). The HIV strains of patients failing HAART showed a progressive impaired replication capacity. In patients failing HAART the impaired replication capacity of HIV strains could justify the persistence of an immune recovery."
15735775,[Lemierre's syndrome].,2004,"Lemierre's syndrome (LS) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of an anaerobic oropharyngeal infection, affecting young adults and adolescents. The disease is characterised by a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and ""metastatic"" infections, which can be followed by fulminant sepsis and rapid death. More recently, it has been reported a recrudescence of this condition, which could be attributable to alterations in antibiotic usage patterns. The authors report the case of a LS secondary to a bout of intense cough, a cause not yet described in the literature, highlighting the importance of a quick diagnosis and the institution of an appropriate therapy."
41400774,Stable Nationwide Sepsis-Related Mortality Does Not Extend to Individuals with Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease.,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sepsis remains highly fatal despite national improvements from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign; furthermore, its effects on patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are not well understood. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-raning Online Data for Epidemiological Research (CDC WONDER) death certificate data from 2011 to 2020, we identified deaths with sepsis as the underlying cause and ALD as a contributing cause. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated overall and by sex, race/ethnicity, region, and urbanization level. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2020, a total of 2357 sepsis-related deaths occurred among ALD patients in the United States (U.S.) While sepsis-related mortality in the overall population remained stable (APC: - 0.88%, 95% CI [confidence interval] - 2.00 to 0.25%), it increased significantly in ALD patients (APC: 8.86%, 95% CI 5.07 to 12.79%). Mortality increased in both sexes, with mortality in females (APC: 9.68%, 95% CI 4.58 to 15.03%) increasing more pronouncedly than in males (APC: 7.79%, 95% CI 4.13 to 11.58%). AAMRs from sepsis-related mortality in ALD individuals increased in the Midwest (APC: 10.77%, 95% CI 4.58 to 17.33%), South (APC: 6.78%, 95% CI 0.26 to 13.73%), and West (APC: 7.35%, 95% CI 3.16 to 11.71%) census areas while remaining stable in the Northeast census area. CONCLUSION: Despite sepsis-related mortality in the U.S. population remaining stable, rates among ALD patients have increased over the past decade. These patterns underscore disparities and the need for targeted interventions such as enhancing early sepsis detection, expanding specialty access, and strengthening alcohol use treatment pathways."
31885914,Using pCO(2) Gap in the Differential Diagnosis of Hyperlactatemia Outside the Context of Sepsis: A Physiological Review and Case Series.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: There is an inverse relationship between cardiac output and the central venous-arterial difference of partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO(2) gap), and pCO(2) gap has been used to guide early resuscitation of septic shock. It can be hypothesized that pCO(2) gap can be used outside the context of sepsis to distinguish type A and type B lactic acidosis and thereby avoid unnecessary fluid resuscitation in patients with high lactate, but without organ hypoperfusion. METHODS: We performed a structured review of the literature enlightening the physiological background. Next, we retrospectively selected a series of case reports of nonseptic critically ill patients with elevated lactate, in whom both arterial and central venous blood gases were simultaneously measured and the diagnosis of either type A or type B hyperlactataemia was conclusively known. In these cases, we calculated venous-arterial CO(2) and O(2) content differences and pCO(2) gap. RESULTS: Based on available physiological data, pCO(2) can be considered as an acceptable surrogate of venous-arterial CO(2) content difference, and it should better reflect cardiac output than central venous saturation or indices based on venous-arterial O(2) content difference. In our case report of nonseptic patients, we observed that if global hypoperfusion was present (i.e., in type A lactic acidosis), pCO(2) gap was elevated (>1 kPa), whilst in the absence of it (i.e., in type B lactic acidosis), pCO(2) gap was low (<0.5 kPa). CONCLUSION: Physiological rationale and a small case series are consistent with the hypothesis that low pCO(2) gap in nonseptic critically ill is suggestive of the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, mandating the search for the cause of type B lactic acidosis rather than administration of fluids or other drugs aimed at increasing cardiac output."
25705355,Bacterial urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients and their antibiotic resistance pattern: A four-year study.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infections in renal transplant recipients and are considered a potential cause of bacteremia, sepsis, and affects graft outcomes. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of UTI among renal transplant recipients and investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of causative agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 1165 patients from March 2009 to December 2012, in transplant center of Golestan Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran, were investigated. Qualitative urine cultures were performed for all cases, causative microorganisms were identified and colony count was performed according to the standard protocol. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was then performed to determine the susceptibility pattern of recovered bacteria from confirmed UTIs. RESULTS: UTI was diagnosed in 391 patients(33.56%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most prevalent isolated microorganisms with E. coli (43.53%), followed by Enterobacter spp. (35.37%) as the major organisms. Among Gram positives, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci was isolated from 6.8% of cases. The rate of resistance to all tested antibiotics was highest in Enterobacter spp., however the most common resistance were seen against cefixime, cephalotin, and cotrimoxazole in all tested gram negatives. CONCLUSION: the rate of UTIs among renal transplant recipients was noticeable in this study with high antibiotic resistance. Multi-resistant bacterial infections are potentially life-threatening emerging problem in renal transplantation. Prophylactic measures must be applied to patients at greater risk."
15729015,[Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis in children. Case records 1985 - 2003].,2004,"Acute bacterial meningitis and sepsis are the most severe among invasive diseases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly in pediatric age, and present a high risk of mortality and neurologic sequelae. S. pneumoniae is a major worldwide pathogen in children. The widespread emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and the epidemiological prevalence of some serotypes, have recently focused attention on S. pneumoniae disease. We reviewed the data on incidence, epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy in children hospitalized with acute bacterial meningitis in the Division of Infectious Diseases of the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, between 1985- 2003. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 16.3% of the children, progressively emerging as the prevalent pathogen. The highest incidence was found in children younger than 2 yrs. The disease still presents a high rate of long-term sequelae, especially hearing loss and neurological handicap. Penicillin and ampicillin resistant isolates were found in 2.3% of positive cultures; no strain was resistant to cephalosporins and vancomycin. Our data support the recommendations to consider administration of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children older than 2 months of age, with special consideration for selected groups. We recommend monitoring all invasive pneumococcal infections in children, the emergence of antibiotic-resistance and changes in prevalence of pathogen serotypes."
19995198,Risk factors for neonatal conjunctivitis in babies of HIV-1 infected mothers.,2009,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and correlates of neonatal conjunctivitis in infants born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected mothers. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study within a perinatal HIV-1 cohort. HIV-1 seropositive mothers were enrolled during pregnancy and mother-infant pairs followed after delivery with assessment for neonatal conjunctivitis at 48 hours and up to 4 weeks after birth. Genital infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and candida) were screened for at 32 weeks gestation. Mothers received treatment for genital infections diagnosed during pregnancy and short-course zidovudine. Newborns did not receive ocular prophylaxis at hospital deliveries. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine cofactors for neonatal conjunctivitis overall and stratified for infant HIV-1 status. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-two infants were assessed and 101 (22.3%) had neonatal conjunctivitis during the first month postpartum. In multivariate analyses using odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI), neonatal conjunctivitis was associated with neonatal sepsis (adjusted OR 21.95, 95% CI 1.76, 274.61), birth before arrival to hospital (adjusted OR 13.91, 95% CI 1.39, 138.78) and birth weight (median 3.4 versus 3.3 kilograms, p=0.016, OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.01, 3.15). Infant HIV-1 infection was not associated with conjunctivitis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite detection and treatment of genital infections during pregnancy, neonatal conjunctivitis was frequently diagnosed in infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers suggesting a need for increased vigilance and prophylaxis for conjunctivitis in these infants. Neonatal sepsis, birth before arrival to hospital, and higher birthweight are factors that may predict higher risk of neonatal conjunctivitis in this population."
25672088,[Perforated neonatal appendicitis in a preterm newborn].,2014,"Abstract: Appendicitis is common in paediatric surgical praxis, but extremely rare in newborn infants. CASE REPORT: We report a premature male newborn from a twin pregnancy with gestational age of 31(+4) weeks, birth-weight 1580g, who underwent a laparotomy because of perforation. The baby was admitted to NICU after birth with transitory respiratory failure and early onset neonatal sepsis. MS-Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood culture, gastric contents and all peripheral specimens, C-reactive protein values were elevated after birth and significantly increased before surgery; thrombocytopenia and mild anemia were found. The control blood culture showed Candida albicans. At day 25 after birth life threatening deterioration occurred: feculent vomiting, progressing distension and palpable rigidity of the abdomen, absence of peristalsis, respiratory distress. Abdominal radiograph showed significantly distension of the intestines, air liquid levels, and discrete signs of pneumoperitoneum. The baby was transferred to the surgery with the diagnosis NEC with perforation. Appendicitis acuta gangrenosa perforativa and peritonitis fibrinopurulenta totalis were found intra-operatively but without signs of NEC. Appendectomy and sanitation of the abdominal cavity were carried out. The histological result confirmed gangrenous perforative appendicitis and purulent necrotic peritonitis. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The boy was transferred to the neonatology on day 33 of life and discharged home 12 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of the low incidence of neonatal appendicitis, it should be taken into consideration if unclear abdominal symptoms occur in the neonatal period. Early surgical intervention contribute to a reduction of potential complications."
41651602,Microcirculatory Dysfunction in Sepsis.,2026,"Microcirculatory dysfunction plays a central role in sepsis pathophysiology and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. While advances in bedside tools and biomarkers offer potential for identifying microcirculatory dysfunction, most therapies targeting the microcirculation have not translated into improved clinical outcomes. Future advances likely lie in precision medicine approaches that employ microcirculatory measurements to guide individualized resuscitation strategies. This article highlights current evidence on the physiology, assessment, and therapeutic approaches to microvascular dysfunction in sepsis, underscoring the need for precision medicine strategies and further research into patient subgroups that may benefit from microcirculation directed interventions."
25545444,Impact of routine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance and cohorting on MRSA-related bloodstream infection in neonatal intensive care unit.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance on the incidence of MRSA-related bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to evaluate cost-effectiveness of MRSA surveillance. STUDY DESIGN: MRSA surveillance policy was introduced in our NICU in April 2008. Pre-MRSA surveillance period (P1, April 2006-March 2008) was compared with the surveillance period (P2, April 2008-April 2010) for MRSA-related BSI (MRSA BSI). RESULTS: During P1 and P2, 1,576 and 1,512 neonates were enrolled. Of these, 3.8/1,000 and 5.3/1,000 developed MRSA BSI, respectively. During P2, 100% MRSA-related BSI occurred in MRSA-colonized neonates, as compared with zero in noncolonized group (p < 0.0001). Overall, 7 (30%) of the 23 neonates colonized during hospitalization developed MRSA BSI as compared with 1 of the 31 (3%) neonates colonized at admission (p = 0.007). Direct screening cost was $208 per patient. Since 28 neonates had to be screened to detect one colonization, $5,824 estimated per detection, excluding indirect costs. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA surveillance may protect non-MRSA colonized neonates from becoming colonized. This is of considerable importance because the acquisition of colonization during hospitalization was associated with a 10-fold increase in risk of developing MRSA BSI. Cost-effectiveness of MRSA surveillance remains debatable and further studies are needed to delineate cost-benefit ratio."
25541846,"The prognostic value of pro-calcitonin, CRP and thyroid hormones in secondary peritonitis: a single-center prospective study.",2014,"BACKGROUND: Infections and sepsis remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in secondary peritonitis. Clinicians are still challenged with the task of finding an early and reliable diagnosis of septic complications. The role of inflammatory markers (Procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive Protein (CRP) and thyroid hormones in determining the severity of secondary peritonitis was evaluated in this study. METHODS: On the preoperative and first, third, fifth, seventh, and fourteenth postoperative days, PCT, CRP, and thyroid hormone concentrations were measured in serum taken from eighty-four consecutive patients who were operated on for secondary peritonitis between January 2008 and January 2010. All data was entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 15.0 and clinical parameters were compared using the student's t-test. RESULTS: For the groups diagnosed with perforated viscus, PCT concentrations were significantly low in contrast to high thyroid hormone levels in patients who developed postoperative complications or died when compared to patients whose postoperative course was uneventful or discharged. The PCT concentration significantly correlated with the CRP concentration and WBC count. CONCLUSION: In the absence of postoperative complications, PCT is a better predictor of outcome than CRP in secondary peritonitis. Our study showed that a low thyroid hormone level can serve as an important prognostic parameter of disease severity in secondary peritonitis."
31875750,Paralytic ileus as the presenting symptom for Guillain-Barre syndrome: a case report.,2020,"Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute neuroimmunological disorder characterized by rapidly ascending symmetrical limb weakness, areflexia, and sensory deficits. Approximately 65% of patients with GBS present with autonomic dysfunction, which commonly occurs in advanced stages. However, paralytic ileus, a sign of gastrointestinal dysautonomia, is rare as the presenting feature in GBS before motor weakness becomes evident. We report the case of a 54-year-old man admitted to the Emergency Department with paralytic ileus as the prodromal feature in early-stage GBS. Total parenteral feeding and prokinetic use were initiated, but no clinical improvement was observed. The patient showed rapid progression to quadriplegia, which was ultimately determined to be respiratory muscle failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission. He underwent 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and muscle strength was partially improved thereafter. However, the patient's enteral nutritional support was undesirable because of persistent poor gastric emptying complicated by fungemia and profound sepsis throughout the hospital course. Finally, he died 1 month after admission. Ignorance of this unusual prodrome to GBS could result in delayed treatment, along with potential progression to life-threatening events. Early recognition of GBS and prompt immunotherapy are critical for reducing morbidity and mortality."
25675754,[Intraabdominal hypertension syndrome in patients with abdominal sepsis].,2014,"Investigations were conducted in 53 patients, operated on in 2013 yr for abdominal sepsis (AS). The patients state severity was determined in accordance to the systemic inflammatory reaction and the polyorgan insufficiency severity. In 28 patients (group I) AS was diagnosed, in 14 (group II)--severe AS, in 11 (group III)--a septic shock. Tactics of surgical management of the patients have included two main measures: the infection origin control (source control), and control of the affected organ function and systemic defense mechanisms (damage control). In all the patients in AS the intraabdominal pressure rising was revealed. Syndrome of intraabdominal hypertension was noted in 10 (18.9%) patients (in 4--while presence of severe AS, and in 6--in septic shock). Lethality was the highest in intraabdominal hypertension degrees III and IV (11 of 25 patients have died)."
25845098,[Endoscopic incision of intravesical ureteroceles in patients with duplex system].,2014,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical status and renal function of pa- tients with duplex system and intravesical ureterocele after drainage by cystoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 9 patients with duplex system and intravesical ureterocele drainage was performed to present recurrent urinary tract infections (7 children with episodes of pyelonephritis and sepsis) or obstruction of the urinary drainage. The mean age was 33 months (range 8-108 months). The thecnique was done under general anesthesia in the operating room and puncture of the ureterocele was performed using cystourethroscopy with loop electrode. The minimum follow-up was 12 months (range 12-48 months) and includes renal ultrasound, renal isotopic study (Mag3 with furosemide) and-echocystography study in patients with preoperative vesicoureteral reflux or postoperative urinary tract infection. RESULTS: The average operative time was 60 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 48 hours. There were no complications during the procedure. In five patients urinary infection episodes disappeared. Ultrasound demonstrated decreased hydronephrosis and megaureter. In two patients the differential renal function following the technique improved. One patient with preoperative split renal function of 14% required nephrectomy. One patient had postoperative vesicoureteral reflux. CONCLUSIONS: The drainage of intravesical ureterocele in patients with duplex system reduces episodes of urinary tract infection and urinary tract dilation."
20954549,Melioidosis in Malaysia.,2009,"Melioidosis is an important cause of sepsis in the tropics, is caused by an environmental saprophyte--B. pseudomallei. It affects mainly adults with underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes. The range of symptoms varies from benign and localized abscesses, to severe community-acquired pneumonia to acute fulminating septicaemia with multiple abscesses often leading to death. B. pseudomallei is an intracellular pathogen and some of the virulence mechanisms that govern the complex interaction between the organism and the host have been elucidated. Isolation of B. pseudomallei from bodily fluids of patients remains the ""gold standard"" in diagnosis but a sensitive and specific serological test can lend support to the diagnosis of melioidosis. Ceftazidime is the treatment of choice for severe melioidosis, but the response is slow. Maintenance or eradication therapy for a prolonged period is necessary to prevent relapse and recurrence. Monitoring IgG antibody levels may be useful as a guideline to determine the duration of eradication therapy."
41409983,Low-cost in-house re-formulated brain heart infusion medium for effective planktonic growth and early detection of bloodstream bacterial pathogens.,2025,"Sepsis, a clinically defined life-threatening condition, is a global contributor to high morbidity and mortality rates in humans. It is caused by systemic bloodstream bacterial infections, primarily involving aerobic pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rapid and accurate identification of these pathogens is a high-demand task, as prolonged diagnosis may increase the mortality rate among sepsis patients. Globally, commercial blood culture systems like the BD BACTEC FX blood culture system, which utilizes BD BACTEC PLUS Aerobic/F culture bottles (used in this study), are commonly used to detect aerobic bloodstream infections. However, due to high costs ( approximately $10.00-$15.00/bottle), limited availability of culture media (especially in low- and middle-income countries, and war zones), and a lack of customization for antibiotic susceptibility assay and epidemiology research, there is a need for secondary alternatives to facilitate the growth and identification of bloodborne pathogens. Therefore, we developed a low-cost ( approximately $4-$5/bottle) in-house culture medium with a newly improved formulation of Brain Heart Infusion media that enhances bacterial growth from spiked human blood tested on a panel of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis). The growth dynamics of these microbes in in-house formulated BHI-Blood+ culture media coincide with those in BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F culture vials, which primarily suggests the compatibility of bloodborne pathogens with this media and can be flagged positive <8 h based on cellular growth rate. Additionally, conventional qPCR-based early detection (<24 h) and validation with the Oxford Nanopore MinION NGS platform highlight the value of this in-house culture media as an alternative to commercial culture media in terms of low-cost availability."
31844987,Aortoesophageal fistula: review of trends in the last decade.,2020,"We reviewed articles on aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) published between January, 2009 and December, 2018. Postoperative aortic disease was the most common cause of AEF, followed by primary aortic aneurysm, bone ingestion, and thoracic cancer. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was the most common initial therapy for primary aortic disease, rather than graft replacement. Secondary AEF developed between 1 and 268 months, and between 1 and 11 months after the initial therapy for aortic disease and thoracic cancer, respectively. TEVAR trended to be preferred over surgery for aortic lesions because of its minimal invasiveness and certified hemostasis. In contrast, esophagectomy was preferred for esophageal lesions to remove the infectious source. A combination of surgery for the aorta (TEVAR, graft replacement or repair) and esophagus (esophagectomy, esophageal stent or repair) was usually adopted. Each graft replacement or esophagectomy was associated with a favorable prognosis for aortic or esophageal surgery, and the combination of graft replacement and esophagectomy generally improved the prognosis remarkably. Antibiotic therapy was given to 65 patients, with 20 receiving multiple antibiotics aimed at strong effects and the type of antibiotic described as broad-spectrum in 29 patients. Meropenem, vancomycin, and fluconazole were the most popular antibiotics used to prevent graft or stent infection. In conclusion, graft replacement and esophagectomy can achieve a favorable prognosis for patients with AEF, but strong, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy might be required to prevent sepsis after surgery."
20357928,Pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways which compromise sperm motility and survival may be altered by L-carnitine.,2009,"The testis is an immunologically privileged organ. Sertoli cells can form a blood-testis barrier and protect sperm cells from self-immune system attacks. Spermatogenesis may be inhibited by severe illness, bacterial infections and chronic inflammatory diseases but the mechanism(s) is poorly understood. Our objective is to help in understanding such mechanism(s) to develop protective agents against temporary or permanent testicular dysfunction. Lipopolysaccaride (LPS) is used as a model of animal sepsis while L-carnitine (LCR) is used as a protective agent. A total of 60 male Swiss albino rats were divided into four groups (15/group). The control group received Saline; the 2(nd) group was given LCR (500 mg/kg i.p, once). The third group was treated with LPS (5 mg/kg i.p once) and the fourth group received LCR then LPS after three hours. From each group, five rats were used for histopathological examination. Biochemical parameters were assessed in the remaining ten rats. At the end of the experiment, animals were lightly anaesthetized with ether where blood samples were collected and testes were dissected on ice. Sperm count and motility were evaluated from cauda epididymis in each animal. Also, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring testicular contents of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-HDG, the DNA adduct for oxidative damage) in testicular DNA. The pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) in addition to lactate dehydrogenase (LDHx) isoenzyme-x activity as an indicator for normal spermatozoal metabolism were assessed in testicular homogenate. Serum interlukin (IL)-2 level was also assessed as a marker for T-helper cell function. The obtained data revealed that LPS induced marked reductions in sperm's count and motility, obstruction in seminiferous tubules, hypospermia and dilated congested blood vessels in testicular sections concomitant with decreased testicular GSH content and LDHx activity. Moreover, the testicular levels of MDA, 8-HDG (in testicular DNA) and NO as well as serum IL-2 level were increased. Administration of LCR before LPS returned both sperm count and motility to normal levels. Also, contents of testicular GSH, MDA, 8-HDG and NO returned back to the corresponding control values. In addition, serum IL-2 level as well as histological abnormalities were markedly improved in LCR + LPS-treated rats. In conclusion, LPS increased proinflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the testis leading to a marked testicular dysfunction. L-carnitine administration ameliorates these effects by antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory mechanisms suggesting a protective role against male infertility in severely infected or septic patients."

25600373,Closing the gap between the molecular and systemic actions of anesthetic agents.,2015,"Genetic approaches have been successfully used to relate the diverse molecular actions of anesthetic agents to their amnestic, sedative, hypnotic, and immobilizing properties. The hypnotic effect of etomidate, quantified as the duration of the loss of righting reflex in mice, is equally mediated by GABAA receptors containing beta2- and beta3-protein subunits. However, only beta3-containing receptors are involved in producing electroencephalogram (EEG)-patterns typical of general anesthesia. The sedative action of diazepam is produced by alpha1-subunit-containing receptors, but these receptors do not contribute to the drug's characteristic EEG-""fingerprint."" Thus, GABAA receptors with alpha1- and beta2-subunits take a central role in causing benzodiazepine-induced sedation and etomidate-induced hypnosis, but the corresponding EEG-signature is difficult to resolve. Contrastingly, actions of etomidate and benzodiazepines mediated via alpha2- and beta3-subunits modify rhythmic brain activity in vitro and in vivo at least in part by enhancing neuronal synchrony. The immobilizing action of GABAergic anesthetics predominantly involves beta3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the spinal cord. Interestingly, this action is self-limiting as GABA-release is attenuated via the same receptors. Anesthetic-induced amnesia is in part mediated by GABAA receptors harboring alpha5-subunits that are highly enriched in the hippocampus and, in addition, by alpha1-containing receptors in the forebrain. Because there is accumulating evidence that in patients the expression pattern of GABAA receptor subtypes varies with age, is altered by the long-term use of drugs, and is affected by pathological conditions like inflammation and sepsis, further research is recommended to adapt the use of anesthetic agents to the specific requirements of individual patients."
31833039,Ionizing Radiation Exposure in NICU.,2020,"The authors prospectively studied ionizing radiation exposure in consecutive 107 very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, admitted to their Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Number of X-rays, their indications and calculated dose of radiation were documented. Their mean birth weight (+SD) and gestational age (+SD) were 1077 (+/-219.8) g and 29.7 (+2.57) wk respectively. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates underwent significantly higher radiographs when compared with VLBW neonates; 7.5(5-13.25) vs. 2(1-6); p < 0.0001. ELBW neonates received 3 times higher dose of radiation, when compared with VLBW neonates; 139.4 musv (81.6-256.15) vs. 46.6 musv (14.4-115.7); p < 0.0001. Seven percent of ELBW neonates received >1msv radiation. Lifetime risk associated with high radiation exposure during neonatal period is unknown. Every effort should be taken to reduce number of radiographs. Imaging modalities without radiation exposure such as, point of care ultrasound should be used wherever possible."
41402639,Cardiorespiratory signatures of necrotizing enterocolitis: a 4-NICU study of very low birth weight infants.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder in very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) infants, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Earlier detection of NEC may improve outcomes. We hypothesized that NEC's physiological signature resembles that of sepsis and that our model developed for sepsis, the Pulse Oximetry Warning System (POWS), would also predict NEC. OBJECTIVES: Assess relationships between continuous heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) features and NEC risk, and evaluate POWS performance for predicting medical and surgical NEC. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter analysis, we studied VLBW infants at four level IV NICUs, identifying cases of late-onset sepsis (LOS) and NEC (Bell stages 2 or 3). Using HR and SpO(2) data, we calculated features and POWS scores and assessed associations with NEC and LOS risk. RESULTS: Among 3914 infants evaluated, 5% had NEC and 13% had LOS. Cardiorespiratory data analysis showed that HR/SpO(2) patterns had similar risk associations with NEC and LOS. POWS AUC was 0.758 for NEC, 0.804 for sepsis, 0.791 for NEC or LOS, and 0.808 for NEC requiring surgery. CONCLUSION: NEC shares a cardiorespiratory signature with LOS. POWS predicted NEC with a dynamic rise before clinical diagnosis. IMPACT: A cardiorespiratory early warning score analyzing heart rate and oxygen saturation, trained to predict late-onset sepsis within 24h across, predicts necrotizing enterocolitis. Heart rate and oxygen saturation features had the same patterns of association with necrotizing enterocolitis as sepsis. The results increase understanding of physiologic signatures of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis."
19934540,A case of unforeseen intractable severe bacteremia due to Acinetobacter baumannii--an efficacy of sulbactam--.,2009,"We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia. She was admitted to our hospital with ventricular tachycardia and was subsequently diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, with no structural heart disease. However, 12 days after admission, she suddenly developed a high-grade fever with chills and diarrhea. Her blood cultures revealed A. baumannii, and the patient was treated with meropenem and amikacin sulfate. Yet, the patient's symptoms and clinical signs became worse. We then began to administer a large quantity of intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam, and the patient improved dramatically. Although rare, bloodstream infection caused by A. baumannii tends to be severe. Therefore, when A. baumannii is found in a patient's bloodstream, clinicians should start appropriate treatment immediately and should recall ampicillin-sulbactam as a sensible option for treatment."
15672789,Effects of polymyxin B immobilized fiber on urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase in patients with severe sepsis.,2004,"Severe sepsis is known to cause multiple organ failure, including renal dysfunction. During sepsis, endotoxin targets the renal proximal tubular cells, the function of which can be evaluated on the basis of urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG). We investigated whether urinary NAG activity is altered in patients with severe sepsis and whether treatment with polymyxin B immobilized fibers (PMX-F) affects this activity. Subjects of this study were 120 patients with severe sepsis and 60 healthy volunteers matched for age and gender. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: PMX-F treatment (n = 70) or conventional treatment (n = 50). The plasma endotoxin level was significantly reduced, from 34.6 +/- 10.2 to 6.8 +/- 2.4 pg/ml (p < 0.01) in patients treated with PMX-F, and the urinary NAG/creatinine ratio was reduced from 46.5 +/- 26.8 U/gm to 18.6 +/- 13.6 U/gm (p < 0.01). The plasma endotoxin level and urinary NAG/creatinine ratio were unchanged in patients who received conventional treatment. The increased urinary NAG/creatinine ratio in patients with severe sepsis may reflect proximal tubular dysfunction. PMX-F is effective in reducing proximal tubular dysfunction, in part owing to reduced plasma endotoxin levels."
15636290,An outbreak of bacteremias associated with Mycobacterium mucogenicum in a hospital water supply.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate and determine the cause of an outbreak of Mycobacterium mucogenicum bacteremias in bone marrow transplant (BMT) and oncology patients. DESIGN: Case-control study and culturing of hospital water sources. Isolates were typed using molecular methods. SETTING: University-affiliated, tertiary-care medical center. PATIENTS: Case-patients were adult and pediatric BMT patients or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (BMT) (n = 5) and oncology (n = 1) patients who were diagnosed as having M. mucogenicum bacteremia during the study period of August through November 1998. Two control-patients were selected for each case-patient matched by age, time of hospitalization, inpatient unit, and type of patient (BMT or oncology). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between case-patients and control-patients regarding intravenous products received or procedures performed, frequency of bathing, neutropenia, or steroid use. Nontuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from several water sources at the medical center including tap water from sinks and showerheads, the hospital hot water source, and the city water supply to the hospital. Analysis by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA showed a match between one patient's blood isolate and an isolate from shower water from that patient's prior hospital room. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the outbreak seemed to be water contamination of central venous catheters (CVCs) during bathing. A recommendation in early 2001 that CVCs be protected from water during bathing was followed by no M. mucogenicum bacteremias during the second half of 2001, only one in 2002, and none at all during 2003."
19961586,Haemoglobin interference and increased sensitivity of fluorimetric assays for quantification of low-parasitaemia Plasmodium infected erythrocytes.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Improvements on malarial diagnostic methods are currently needed for the correct detection in low-density Plasmodium falciparum infections. Microfluorimetric DNA-based assays have been previously used for evaluation of anti-malarial drug efficacy on Plasmodium infected erythrocytes. Several factors affecting the sensitivity of these methods have been evaluated, and tested for the detection and quantification of the parasite in low parasitaemia conditions. METHODS: Parasitaemia was assessed by measuring SYBRGreen I (SGI) and PicoGreen (PG) fluorescence of P. falciparum Dd2 cultures on human red blood cells. Different modifications of standard methods were tested to improve the detection sensitivity. Calculation of IC50 for chloroquine was used to validate the method. RESULTS: Removal of haemoglobin from infected red-blood cells culture (IRBC) increased considerably the fluorescent signal obtained from both SGI and PG. Detergents used for cell lysis also showed to have an effect on the fluorescent signal. Upon depletion of haemoglobin and detergents the fluorescence emission of SGI and PG increased, respectively, 10- and 60-fold, extending notably the dynamic range of the assay. Under these conditions, a 20-fold higher PG vs. SGI fluorescent signal was observed. The estimated limits of detection and quantification for the PG haemoglobin/detergent-depleted method were 0.2% and 0.7% parasitaemia, respectively, which allow the detection of ~10 parasites per microliter. The method was validated on whole blood-infected samples, displaying similar results as those obtained using IRBC. Removal of white-blood cells prior to the assay allowed to increase the accuracy of the measurement, by reducing the relative uncertainty at the limit of detection from 0.5 to 0.1. CONCLUSION: The use of PG microassays on detergent-free, haemoglobin-depleted samples appears as the best choice both for the detection of Plasmodium in low-density infections and anti-malarial drugs tests."
32053505,Clinical characteristics and risk factors for shock and death from E. coli bacteremia in pediatric hematological patients.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical features and risk factors for shock and mortality from Escherichia coli bacteremia among children and adolescents with hematological disorders. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study of E. coli bacteremia in the hematology department at Xiangya Hospital from January 2013 to June 2018 was conducted. Clinical characteristics, laboratory results and antimicrobial susceptibility were analysed. Risk factors for shock and mortality were also investigated. RESULTS: Of the 45 strains of E. coli, 73.3% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Septic shock was observed in 51.1% of patients, and the 30-day all-cause mortality was 22.2%. The risk factors associated with shock were an elevated red blood cell distribution (RDW) value when bloodstream infections (BSIs) occurred (> 15%, OR, 6.840; 95% CI, 1.571 - 29.788) and a lower WBC count (< 300/mm3, OR, 6.761; 95% CI, 1.383 - 33.044). Multivariate analysis showed that only an elevated D-dimer level (> 0.5 mg/L, OR 12.250, 95% CI 1.268 - 118.361) was a risk factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, we observed decreases for RDW changes at two time points (neutropenia and BSIs occurred) in the non-shock group and survival group. CONCLUSIONS: MDR infections from E. coli bacteremia were common in pediatric hematological patients. In our setting, the laboratory results may serve as a clue for physicians to distinguish patients at higher risk for shock and mortality. Furthermore, RDW could be used as a biomarker to elucidate potential disorders in hematological patients."
25677999,The epidemiology and diagnosis of invasive candidiasis among premature infants.,2015,"Invasive candidiasis is a leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Improved recognition of modifiable risk factors and antifungal prophylaxis has contributed to the recent decline in the incidence of this infection among infants. Invasive candidiasis typically occurs in the first 6 weeks of life and presents with nonspecific signs of sepsis. Definitive diagnosis relies on the growth of Candida in blood culture or cultures from other normally sterile sites, but this may identify fewer than half of cases. Improved diagnostics are needed to guide the initiation of antifungal therapy in premature infants."
15725527,Implications of the re-invasion of Southeast Uganda by Glossina pallidipes on the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis.,2005,"A study to assess the influence of re-invasion of Glossina pallidipes on the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis was conducted in Southeast Uganda. A total of 1,992 cattle were screened in villages, with (949) and without G. pallidipes (1043) for trypanosomosis using a combination of the BCT and HCT methods. The prevalence of trypanosomosis (15.5%), Trypanosoma brucei infection (1.4%), T. congolense infection (7.2%), T. vivax infection (5.3%) and mixed infection (1.6%) in cattle in villages with was significantly higher than in those without G. pallidipes: trypanosomosis (7.1%), T. brucei infection (0.6%), T. congolense infection (2.0%), T. vivax infection (3.3%) and mixed infection (1.2%) (overall trypanosome infection, chi2=35.5, d.f.=1, P<0.05; T. brucei infection, chi2=8.06, d.f.=1, P<0.05; T. congolense infection, chi2=22.8, d.f.=1, P<0.05 and T. vivax infection, chi2=6.4, d.f.=1, P<0.05). Infections of Trypanosoma congolense were predominant in cattle in villages with G. pallidipes, while T. vivax infections were predominant in cattle in villages without. In all villages, T. brucei infections were fewer than either T. congolense or T. vivax infections. The risk of transmission of T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax infections was 3, 2.7 and 1.6 times, respectively, higher in villages with G. pallidipes than in those without, despite the presence of G. f. fuscipes in either set of villages. The mean PCV (28.27+/-0.41, 95% CI) and mean herd size (3+/-0.46) of cattle in villages with G. pallidipes were significantly (P<0.05) lower than in those in villages without (mean PCV, 29.48+/-0.34; mean herd size, 4+/-0.72). It is evident that presence of G. pallidipes brings about an increase in the prevalence of T. congolense, which causes a more severe disease in cattle than other species of trypanosomes. This is a rare case of a re-invasion of a tsetse species whose disease transmission capability calls for refocusing of the traditional national tsetse and trypanosomosis control strategies to contain it."
41454221,Optimizing diagnosis of Bacillus cereus bacteremia using time to positivity: a retrospective observational study to differentiate true bacteremia from contamination.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacillus cereus can occasionally cause invasive infections, irrespective of the host's immune status. However, the presence of B. cereus in a single blood culture is typically considered a contaminant, potentially leading to an underestimation of the true incidence of B. cereus bacteremia. This study aimed to evaluate the cut-off value for time to positivity (TTP) to distinguish true bacteremia from contamination. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients with positive blood cultures for B. cereus between November 2011 and February 2025. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of TTP, which was achieved by plotting the sensitivity (the true-positive rate) on the y-axis against 1 - specificity (the false-positive rate) on the x-axis for a series of potential TTP cut-off points. RESULTS: During the study period, 49 patients were enrolled, of whom 18 were classified into the true bacteremia group and 31 into the contamination group. All patients had at least two sets of blood cultures collected. The median TTP was significantly shorter among patients in the true bacteremia group (7.8 h; interquartile range [IQR], 6.5-8.9) than in the contamination group (11.2 h; IQR, 9.9-13) (p < 0.001). ROC curve analysis indicated that a cutoff value of 9.0 h achieved the highest sensitivity (77.8%) and specificity (90.3%) for predicting true bacteremia, while a more lenient threshold of TTP > 13.0 h yielded 100% sensitivity for identifying contamination. CONCLUSIONS: A cut-off value of 9.0 h can differentiate true B. cereus bacteremia from contamination, whereas a TTP > 13 h is indicative of contamination. Given its suboptimal diagnostic accuracy, TTP can help differentiate true B. cereus bacteremia from contamination but should be interpreted with clinical and laboratory data for the diagnosis of sepsis."
31945945,Clustering Blood Pressure Trajectories in Septic Shock in the Emergency Department.,2019,"Hemodynamic management of sepsis in the emergency department relies on fluid resuscitation and vasoactive therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure and end-organ perfusion. While typical practice targets certain thresholds of blood pressure (such as 65 mmHg mean arterial or 90 mmHg systolic blood pressure [SBP]), little consideration is given to temporal dynamics of blood pressure. In this work, we use unsupervised learning methods to reveal characteristic SBP trajectories in the two hours either surrounding the start of hypotensive episodes (SBP <; 90 mmHg) or immediately preceding the initiation of vasopressor therapy. Our results show that hypotensive episodes tended to either resolve very quickly (within 40 minutes) or extend for prolonged periods (at least 1 hour). Those with prolonged hypotension constituted 74% of all patients with at least one measurement of SBP <; 90 mmHg. Of them, patients who entered hypotension by a large, acute drop from a normal SBP over the preceding hour had a greater incidence of subsequent vasopressor administration than those with a more gradual decline into hypotension. Overall, our results suggest that a significant subset of patients, especially those with stable but low SBP, should have received vasopressors when they did not, or should have received them sooner. Dynamic trajectories appear to be important factors in clinical practice of hemodynamic management of sepsis."
15611810,Clinical characteristics at initial presentation and impact of dual therapy on the outcome of bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia in adults.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are bacteremic. Bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia (BSPP) is the number one cause of mortality, representing up to 70% of all CAP deaths. In fact, all CAP guidelines have identified this issue as one of the most important issues when establishing their recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of dual antibiotic therapy in patients with BSPP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All cases of BSPP in patients 18 years of age and older who were hospitalized from 1995 to 2000 were retrospectively analyzed. The standard initial therapeutic regimen used was cefuroxime with or without a macrolide from 1995 to 1997, and ceftriaxone and azithromycin or clarithromycin from 1998 to 2000. During the 1995 to 1997 period, only 16% of the patients initially received a macrolide, whereas all patients in the 1998 to 2000 period received a macrolide at admission. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (49 men, 46 women) with a mean age of 63 years (range 20 to 98 years) were included in the present study. The mean pneumonia severity index at admission was 113 for the monotherapy cohort and 114 for the dual therapy group. At admission, 30.5% of patients had a leukocyte count greater than 20 109/L, 11.5% had a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, 44.2% had a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min and 33.6% had nausea/vomiting, necessitating some form of therapy or preventing the patient from eating. In addition, 16.8% had no fever at admission. Overall, 72.5% became afebrile within 48 h. Fifteen (15.8%) patients died (four within the first 72 h). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the monotherapy group (11 of 42 patients; 25.6%) than in the dual therapy cohort (four of 53 patients; 7.5%) (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.74). Antibiotic resistance was not associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: The combination of ceftriaxone plus a macrolide significantly reduced the mortality rate compared with monotherapy (cefuroxime) in patients with CAP that have the highest mortality rate."
41432474,Antifungal susceptibility of non-albicans Candida species from blood samples.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have emerged as a notable cause of both healthcare-associated and opportunistic infections. Compared with Candida albicans, NAC species are more likely to cause infections fraught with antifungal resistance issues and higher mortality rates. The objectives of this study were to identify the various Candida species causing candidaemia in a Malaysian general hospital and to ascertain their antifungal susceptibility profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 15-month cross-sectional study involved the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with candidaemia. Conclusive species identification was achieved through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) while antifungal susceptibility was performed using the colourimetric broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 118 non-duplicate Candida isolates were analysed during the study period. Out of this total, 47 (39.8%) were C. albicans, 25 (21.2%) were Candida parapsilosis complex, 24 (20.3%) were Candida tropicalis, 19 (16.1%) were Nakaseomyces glabratus and three (2.6%) were Pichia kudriavzevii. Collectively, the NAC species outnumbered C. albicans (60.2% vs. 39.8%). The overall minimal inhibitory concentration at which >/=90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90) for NAC species was 32 microg/mL for fluconazole, 1 microg/mL for amphotericin B and between 1 to 2 microg/mL for the echinocandins. CONCLUSION: Despite C. albicans being the single most frequently isolated species from patients with candidaemia, more than half of candidaemia cases in our centre were caused by NAC species. Generally, although these NAC species were not fluconazole-susceptible, amphotericin B and echinocandins may still be utilised against them."
16424668,Non-occlusive small bowel necrosis during enteral feeding after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,2005,"BACKGROUND: Early enteral tube feeding is widely used after major surgery and trauma. This article is intended to alert surgeons to the possibility of small bowel necrosis following enteral refeeding and to discuss etiology and clinical features. METHODS: A case series from a single surgeon's database at a Tertiary Care Center is reported. Cases were drawnfrom a consecutive series of patients undergoing pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and placement of a needle catheter jejunostomy between January 1998 and June 2004. RESULTS: Two patients receiving early postoperative tube feeding developed sepsis with subsequent small bowel necrosis. Abdominal distension and signs of sepsis developed early postoperatively. Diagnosis was made based on characteristic computed tomography findings. Both patients underwent laparotomy with segmental bowel resection and survived. CONCLUSION: Non-specific septic symptoms associated with recurrent abdominal distension are ominous signs in patients receiving early postoperative enteral tube feeding and should prompt discontinuation of enteral nutrition. Within this scenario, CT imaging represents a valuable adjunct in the early assessment of these patients."
41542729,Impact of preoperative anemia on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a multi-institutional retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) involves unique physiological challenges, including single-lung ventilation, that may amplify the effects of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity in anemic patients. Despite the minimally invasive nature of VATS, the specific impact of preoperative anemia on outcomes following these procedures remains inadequately characterized. METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study using TriNetX research network data (2010-2024). Adults undergoing VATS with preoperative hemoglobin measurements were included. The anemia group (hemoglobin 8-12 g/dL) was compared to the control group (hemoglobin >/=12 g/dL) using 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS: After matching, 8,346 pairs of patients were analyzed. Patients with preoperative anemia had significantly higher 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-4.39, P<0.0001) (primary outcome), intensive care unit admission (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.27-1.67, P<0.0001), acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.58-2.32, P<0.0001), pneumonia/respiratory failure (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53-1.95, P<0.0001), and sepsis (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36-2.36, P<0.0001). These associations remained consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to academic medical centers, patients without blood transfusions, and those with stable hemoglobin levels throughout the perioperative period. Sex-specific analyses revealed higher risks of respiratory complications, AKI, sepsis, and deep vein thrombosis in males, while females with anemia demonstrated higher mortality risk. Even mild anemia was associated with significantly increased complications. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative anemia is strongly associated with adverse outcomes following VATS, with an over threefold increased mortality risk. These findings highlight the importance of preoperative anemia assessment and management in patients undergoing VATS."
20000104,"[Clinical efficacy of the biospecific hemosorbent ""Liposorb""].",2009,"The aim of the present work was to evaluate clinical efficacy of the biospecific hemosorbent ""Liposorb"". The main component of ""Liposorb"" is polyacrylamide gel containing an immobilized affine ligand (antibiotic polymyxin E-colistyne). 40 patients with abdominal sepsis and peritonitis of different genesis underwent a total of 52 seances of vein-venous extracorporeal hemoperfusion of hemosorbent ""Liposorb"". Endotoxin level (lipopolysaccharide - LPS) was measured by the turbodimetric method. Blood perfusion through a ""Liposorb"" column at 50-70 ml/min during 90 minutes permitted to reach stabilization of parameters of systemic hemodynamics. All the patients showed positive dynamics of general well-being, blood gas composition, clinical and biochemical blood analyses. The endotoxin (LPS) level of Gramm-negative flora significantly decreased. It is concluded that hemosorbtion using biospecific polymyxin-containing hemosorbent ""Liposorb"" effectively removes Gramm-negative endotoxin and leads to stabilization of hemodynamic in patients with Gramm-negative abdominal sepsis."
20589153,"Health care related factors associated with severe malaria in children in Kampala, Uganda.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is responsible for the high load of malaria mortality. It is not clearly understood why some malaria episodes progress to severe malaria. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with severe malaria in children aged 6 months to 5 years living in Kampala. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, 100 children with severe malaria were matched by age and place of residence with 100 children with non-severe malaria. We collected health care information from care takers. RESULTS: Mean duration of illness before getting antimalarial treatment was shorter for controls than cases (8 hours vs. 20 hours, p 0.015). Children with severe malaria were less likely to have been treated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.85, p 0.016). Odds of severe malaria were higher in those who reported lack of protective measures (mosquito coils (OR = 20.63, 95% CI 1.5-283.3, p=0.02 and insecticide sprays OR 10.93, 95% CI 1.13-105.64, p=0.03), although few reported their use. CONCLUSIONS: Early anti-malarial treatment and use of barriers against mosquitoes prevent severe malaria in children. There is need to increase the use of barriers against mosquito bites and to scale up prompt treatment and community-based interventions to reduce the incidence of severe malaria in children."
31818277,A case report of endorectal displacement of a right ureteral stent following radiochemotherapy and Bevacizumab.,2019,"BACKGROUND: The angiogenesis inhibitor monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab is presently the standard treatment for numerous neoplasms but particular toxicities are emerging, such as hypertension, haemorrhage, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae, and delayed wound healing. The addition of Bevacizumab to radio and chemotherapy has improved the overall survival rate in patients with metastatic, persistent or recurrent cervical carcinoma. However an increased risk of enteric or urinary fistula formation has been documented, related to hypoxia which is induced by the inhibition of angiogenesis. Moreover, previous pelvic surgery, repeated ureteral stenting and radiation are additional risk factors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the remarkable case of a right ureteral stent displacement inside the rectum lumen in a patient treated with Bevacizumab for pelvic recurrence of cervical cancer. The patient was referred to our Urology Department with urinary sepsis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Right ureteral stent substitution was planned; at cystoscopy the distal loop of the stent was not visualized inside the bladder. The presence of the distal loop of the right ureteral inside the rectum was clearly demonstrated with a CT scan. CONCLUSIONS: Since Bevacizumab is increasingly used in the treatment of gynaecological neoplasms and indwelling ureteral stents are often required to treat or prevent ureteral compressions, similar cases are likely to be diagnosed and this complication should be considered in the management of advanced pelvic cancers."
31838318,Anaerobic neonatal meningitis: A diagnostic challenge.,2020,The most commonly identified pathogens related to bacterial meningitis are group B streptococcus and gram-negative enteric flora; anaerobic sepsis and meningitis are very rare. We report a case on a preterm and extremely low-birth weight infant who developed meningitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis and his mother who had postpartum sepsis also caused by the same agent.
41651601,Immunology of Sepsis.,2026,"Sepsis-related immune dysregulation occurs in three overlapping phases, including pathogen recognition, inflammation, and immune paralysis. There are many immune cells that underlie these three phases, with the most well-studied being epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. These cells regulate multiple downstream mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, that can be measured and used as immunologic biomarkers. Past failures in sepsis immune-modulating treatment trials have likely resulted from the inclusion of patients meeting sepsis clinical criteria but who do not sufficiently express the immunologic target under investigation. More precise approaches to trial designs may uncover effective immune-modulating therapies."
25631594,"Australian Enterococcal Sepsis Outcome Programme annual report, 2013.",2014,"From 1 January to 31 December 2013, 26 institutions around Australia participated in the Australian Enterococcal Sepsis Outcome Programme (AESOP). The aim of AESOP 2013 was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteraemia isolates in Australia that are antimicrobial resistant, and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Of the 826 unique episodes of bacteraemia investigated, 94.6% were caused by either E. faecalis (56.1%) or E. faecium (38.5%). Ampicillin resistance was not detected in E. faecalis but was detected in over 90% of E. faecium. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was reported in 0.2% and 40.9% of E. faecalis and E. faecium respectively and was predominately due to the acquisition of the vanB operon. Overall, 41.6% of E. faecium harboured vanA or vanB genes. The percentage of E. faecium bacteraemia isolates resistant to vancomycin in Australia is significantly higher than that seen in most European countries. E. faecium isolates consisted of 81 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pulsotypes of which 72.3% were classified into 14 major pulsotypes containing five or more isolates. Multilocus sequence typing grouped the 14 major pulsotypes into clonal cluster 17, a major hospital-adapted polyclonal E. faecium cluster. Of the 2 predominant sequence types, ST203 (80 isolates) was identified across Australia and ST555 (40 isolates) was isolated primarily in the western and central regions (Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia) respectively. In conclusion, the AESOP 2013 has shown enterococcal bacteraemias in Australia are frequently caused by polyclonal ampicillin-resistant high-level gentamicin resistant vanB E. faecium, which have limited treatment options."
41438024,Prognostic value of the pan-immune-inflammation value for mortality in sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Its associated coagulopathy, known as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), significantly increases mortality risk. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), a composite biomarker reflecting systemic immune and inflammatory status, has been linked to prognosis in various diseases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of PIV in patients with SIC and to develop predictive models accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database and included 4554 patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patients were stratified into high- and low-PIV groups based on the median PIV, and clinical characteristics were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were employed to assess the association between PIV and patient outcomes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to identify key variables for constructing a nomogram model. Additionally, machine learning algorithms, including random forest, were applied to build and validate predictive models. RESULTS: Patients in the high-PIV group had significantly higher 30-day and 90-day mortality rates. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with lower PIVs had markedly better survival, and a nonlinear positive correlation was observed between PIV and mortality risk. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression identified 8 key variables, including Acute Physiology Score III, lactate, red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, acute kidney injury, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The nomogram based on these variables achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Among machine learning models, the random forest algorithm exhibited the best predictive performance, with areas under the curve of 0.837 and 0.947 in the training and validation sets, respectively. External validation using a real-world cohort from Xingtai People's Hospital further confirmed the association between elevated PIV and increased mortality and SIC, with consistent survival trends and nonlinear patterns observed in both Kaplan-Meier and restricted cubic spline analyses. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate PIV into the prognostic assessment of patients with SIC. The development of a visual nomogram and machine learning-based models provides clinicians with practical tools for early identification of patients at high risk for SIC, potentially aiding in the optimization of treatment strategies."
31876752,Procalcitonin for predicting catheter-associated bloodstream infection: A meta-analysis.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: The predictive accuracies of procalcitonin (PCT) in the diagnosis of catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI) vary widely. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the predictive value of PCT for CABSI. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and studies published up to 10 March 2019. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to evaluate PCT predictive value using Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: The meta-analysis was composed of 7 studies, consisting of 347 subjects. Pooled analysis demonstrated that a high PCT was significantly correlated with CABSI (pooled OR = 23.36, 95%CI 12.43-43.91, P < .001) and medium heterogenicity (I = 36.9%, P = .147). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 85% (95%CI 0.76-0.91) and 89% (95%CI 0.68-0.97), respectively. Although Begg funnel plot (P = .007) indicated the presence of publication bias among the included studies, the stability of the pooled outcomes was verified by the trim-and-fill method. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses did not show important differences in effect estimation. CONCLUSION: PCT is an effective predictor of CABSI. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether PCT could predict CABSI."
41415274,Multiplexed longitudinal analysis of the cellular and microbial dynamics of acute polymicrobial sepsis in mice.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Acute polymicrobial sepsis is a life-threatening emergency caused by the body's immune response to bloodstream infection by two or more microbes. Early detection and management of sepsis have been the focus of global survey programs, driven by its association with hospital readmissions and long-term adverse health outcomes. METHODS: Animal models are essential tools for studying mechanisms of sepsis pathogenesis and the only way to empirically dissect the acute phase of disease. With this in mind, the goal of the current study was two-fold: to demonstrate the feasibility of performing multiplexed longitudinal assessment of acute sepsis pathogenesis and to emphasize the granularity with which acute sepsis can be studied using this method. Using the fecal suspension test (FST) model of acute polymicrobial sepsis in C57BL/6 mice we simultaneously characterize hematological, immunological, and microbiological aspects of acute sepsis induction. RESULTS: Our data shows that high dimensional flow cytometry paired with flow-based plasma cytokine measurements captures the dynamic shift from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory immune responses during an acute septic event; highlighting the role of emergency myelopoiesis in this process. Additionally, myeloid cell heterogeneity is characterized and strongly implicates the emergence of myeloid derived suppressor like cells (MDSC-like cells) as central to this switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 16S-based method for studying the blood biome that allows for discrimination between endogenous (bacterial DNAemia) and exogenous (actively growing bacteria in blood) sources of microbial DNA. Using this approach, we demonstrate that polymicrobial sepsis in our model is due to outgrowth of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus; two genera of bacterial pathobionts commonly observed in human sepsis patients. Finally, using several assessments of disease severity, we demonstrate stratification of septic mice into survivors and non-survivors and show how pre-septic immune assessment can be used to identify potential biomarkers of sepsis risk. DISCUSSION: Collectively, the approach we describe simultaneously reduces research animal use, strengthens scientific rigor, provides a pre-clinical platform for biomarker discovery and the study of therapeutic interventions, and most importantly advances our ability to study the acute phase of sepsis that carries a high mortality rate and is difficult to prospectively study in humans."
25499096,Early high protein intake is associated with low mortality and energy overfeeding with high mortality in non-septic mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Early protein and energy feeding in critically ill patients is heavily debated and early protein feeding hardly studied. METHODS: A prospective database with mixed medical-surgical critically ill patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation (>72 hours) and measured energy expenditure was used in this study. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the relation between admission day-4 protein intake group (with cutoffs 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 g/kg), energy overfeeding (ratio energy intake/measured energy expenditure > 1.1), and admission diagnosis of sepsis with hospital mortality after adjustment for APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score. RESULTS: A total of 843 patients were included. Of these, 117 had sepsis. Of the 736 non-septic patients 307 were overfed. Mean day-4 protein intake was 1.0 g/kg pre-admission weight per day and hospital mortality was 36%. In the total cohort, day-4 protein intake group (odds ratio (OR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.99; P = 0.047), energy overfeeding (OR 1.62; 95%CI 1.07 to 2.44; P = 0.022), and sepsis (OR 1.77; 95%CI 1.18 to 2.65; P = 0.005) were independent risk factors for mortality besides APACHE II score. In patients with sepsis or energy overfeeding, day-4 protein intake was not associated with mortality. For non-septic, non-overfed patients (n = 419), mortality decreased with higher protein intake group: 37% for < 0.8 g/kg, 35% for 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg, 27% for 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg, and 19% for >/= 1.2 g/kg (P = 0.033). For these, a protein intake level of >/= 1.2 g/kg was significantly associated with lower mortality (OR 0.42, 95%CI 0.21 to 0.83, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: In non-septic critically ill patients, early high protein intake was associated with lower mortality and early energy overfeeding with higher mortality. In septic patients early high protein intake had no beneficial effect on mortality."
25504648,Predicting risk of endovascular device infection in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (PREDICT-SAB).,2015,"BACKGROUND: Prompt recognition of underlying cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infection in patients presenting with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is critical for optimal management of these cases. The goal of this study was to identify clinical predictors of CIED infection in patients presenting with SAB and no signs of pocket infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: All cases of SAB in CIED recipients at Mayo Clinic from 2001 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 131 patients with CIED who presented with SAB and had no clinical signs of device pocket infection. Forty-five (34%) of these patients had underlying CIED infection based on clinical or echocardiographic criteria. The presence of a permanent pacemaker rather than an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (odds ratio, 3.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-9.23; P=0.002), >1 device-related procedure (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.86; P=0.018), and duration of SAB >/=4 days (odds ratio, 5.54; 95% confidence interval, 3.32-13.23; P<0.001) were independently associated with an increased risk of CIED infection in a multivariable model. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the multivariable model was 0.79, indicating a good discriminatory capacity to distinguish SAB patients with and without CIED infection. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients presenting with SAB and no signs of pocket infection, the risk of underlying CIED infection can be calculated based on the type of device, number of device-related procedures, and duration of SAB. We propose that patients without any of these high-risk features have a low risk of underlying CIED infection and may be monitored closely without immediate device extraction. Prospective studies are needed to validate this risk prediction model."
19957858,[Atypical vascular tumors of the gastrointestinal tract: four uncommon cases].,2009,"AIM: A small but significant percentage of vascular tumors may develop at extracutaneous location. They are difficult to detect on the physical exam and usually they require immediate intervention. Pediatric surgeons must have acknowledge of its prognostic and therapeutic implications. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: We report 4 of these patients. Patient 1 was a healthy newborn who presented in the second week of life, recurrent severe gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Diagnosis of multifocal linfangioendoteliomatosis with thrombocytopenia was established. Patient 2 had prenatal diagnosis of ascites and presented at birth sepsis, anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypoproteinemia. Upon laparotomy hemorrhagic ascites and thickening of rectum-sigmoid wall and mesentery were found. Pathologic diagnosis was Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and the clinical course was consistent with Kassabach-Merrit phenomenon. Patient 3 had at birth, multifocal hepatic GLUT1- hemangiomatosis with severe cardiac insufficiency and coagulopathy. She died while waiting for a liver transplantation. Patient 4 is a girl who presented in the newborn period with vomiting and hematochezia. She required several transfusions and endoscopic biopsies showed a vascular tumor that infiltrated duodenum, jejunum and mesentery. Imaging studies and histologic findings on biopsy led to the diagnostic of juvenile hemangioma GLUT-1+. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular tumors of the digestive tract may be difficult to diagnosis and their classification is still incomplete. Pediatric surgeons must be acquainted with these varieties of tumors because they are always involved in diagnosis and therapeutic decision making."
19949727,Significance of anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio in predicting hepatitis C viremia.,2009,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing can be performed using qualitative or quantitative assays, and it is still unclear which is more useful as a primary test in patients positive for anti-HCV. The present study evaluated the usefulness of anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO ratio) for predicting HCV RNA results. METHODS: Patients on whom a qualitative HCV RNA test was performed due to a positive anti-HCV enzyme immunoassay were enrolled. Patients were divided into viremia and no-viremia groups according to HCV RNA results. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of anti-HCV S/CO for a diagnosis of viremia. RESULTS: In total, 487 patients were enrolled. HCV RNA was positive in 301 subjects (61.8%). Age, serum ALT level, and anti-HCV S/CO ratio were significantly different between the viremia and no-viremia groups. By ROC curve analysis, anti-HCV S/CO ratio (area, 0.989; 95% confidence interval, 0.981 to 0.998) accurately predicted the presence of viremia, with a cutoff value of 10.9 (sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 97.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HCV S/CO ratio was found to be highly accurate at predicting HCV viremia. The anti-HCV S/CO ratio can be used to determine whether a quantitative or qualitative HCV RNA test should be used to confirm HCV viremia in patients with a positive anti-HCV by the following criteria: if the anti-HCV S/CO ratio is <10.9, a qualitative HCV RNA test can be used, and if the anti-HCV S/CO ratio is >or=10.9 a quantitative HCV RNA test can be performed."
15832976,[Acute renal failure in children. Study of 35 patients].,2004,"The medical care of children with acute renal failure and the necessity of the substituting the renal functions has dramatically modified over the past 15 years. The study has been conducted retrospectively on 35 children diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF), for analyzing the etiological spectrum, the evolutionary patterns and the influence factors of the ARF evolution. The following parameters have been taken into consideration: ARF etiology, hTA/HTA, oliguria, level of serum creatinine, the type of treatment (renal substitution by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or conservative treatment). The ARF etiology is dominated by the sepsis (31.4%) and by the hemolytic and uremic syndrome (17.1%). The treatment applied was conservative in 48.5% of the cases; 51.50% of the patients were in critical state and required extrarenal substitution by hemodialysis--42.8%--and peritoneal dialysis--8.5%. Global mortality is reduced (22.8%), but in the dialysed patients it is of 44.44%. The main death causes were: severe hepatic failure, oncological diseases, severe neurological damage and hemodynamic damages. In conclusion, the ARF prognosis in children is influenced by the comorbidity states. Dialysis has improved the therapeutic results in the currently presented lot, the death causes being extrarenal."
31897445,"Descriptive and correlational study of the epidemiological, clinical and etiological characteristics of peritonitis in the surgical department of the HUEH during the period from January 2013 to December 2018: A protocol study.",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Generalized secondary peritonitis is one of the most common emergencies encountered in surgical departments with a mortality of up to 20%. While early prognostic assessment of peritonitis is essential for the objective classification of the severity of the disease, the late presentation of the majority of patients to health facilities affects this situation, further complicating effective management and promoting the occurrence of complications. In Haiti, few studies on surgical pathologies are available, and with regard to peritonitis, only two thesis works have been listed on the subject. This study aims to: explore the demographic, clinical and etiological characteristics of peritonitis in the main referral hospital in the metropolitan region of the Haiti, and evaluate the main delays and its relationship with the severity of the disease by measuring the MPI score. METHODOLOGY: It is a correlational descriptive study, retrospectively carried out over a period of 6 years, from January 2013 to December 2018 in the surgical department of the Hospital of the State University of Haiti. The study population is composed of all patients diagnosed, hospitalized and operated on in the peritonitis ward during the study period Pearson's correlation with alpha < 0.05 was used as the significance threshold and the correlation of complications and duration of management by Spearman's correlation to assess the relationship between sex, age group, complications and length of hospital stay. A multiple linear regression will be done for the most significant correlations. The comparison of the means was made by the Z test, with alpha < 0.05 as the significance threshold, and the student T test for variables with two modalities such as complication. The ANOVA test was used to cross-reference dependent and independent variables with more than 2 modalities, and the Pearson chi-square test for qualitative variables with etiological and demographic diagnoses."
15700692,[Polymicrobial sepsis and perityphlic abscess: case report and review of literature].,2004,"AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of conservative therapy of polymicrobial anaerobic sepsis and appendiceal mass. CASE REPORT: We report on an 18-year-old patient admitted for fever (38.8 degrees C), abdominal pain and vomiting. Leukocytosis with left shift maturation, and diarrhea were noted during hospital stay. A Fusobacterium species and Bacteroides ovatus were isolated from blood culture specimens. Radiologic examination with barium enema showed normal ileocecal region, while colonoscopy indicated terminal ileitis. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed appendiceal mass sized 6.5x5.5 cm in the right lower quadrant. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy consisting of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and metronidazole for 21 days. He was discharged from the hospital when control ultrasound indicated disappearance of the appendiceal mass. DISCUSSION: Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of urgent surgery in children. Bacterial enteritis limited to the ileocecal region appears to be responsible for an appreciable number of unnecessary appendectomies. On the other hand, diagnostic errors in appendicitis may delay early appendectomy and result in the formation of appendiceal mass. The advent of high-resolution real-time scanners and graded compression sonography has enabled not only an accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis but also a reliable diagnosis of other diseases of the ileocecal region. Acute terminal ileitis has similar clinical and laboratory manifestations as acute appendicitis, thus presenting a common diagnostic problem in daily practice. Perforation occurs in 20% to 30% of children with acute appendicitis. Perforation may be difficult to diagnose by sonography. The most common complications are peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscesses. The management of appendiceal mass remains controversial, such as interval appendectomy after nonoperative treatment. CONCLUSION: Successful conservative treatment for polymicrobial anaerobic sepsis and appendiceal mass in an 18-year-old patient is described. The case report is followed by review of the literature on the appendiceal mass management."
31823148,A novel id-iri score: development and internal validation of the multivariable community acquired sepsis clinical risk prediction model.,2020,"We aimed to develop a scoring system for predicting in-hospital mortality of community-acquired (CA) sepsis patients. This was a prospective, observational multicenter study performed to analyze CA sepsis among adult patients through ID-IRI (Infectious Diseases International Research Initiative) at 32 centers in 10 countries between December 1, 2015, and May 15, 2016. After baseline evaluation, we used univariate analysis at the second and logistic regression analysis at the third phase. In this prospective observational study, data of 373 cases with CA sepsis or septic shock were submitted from 32 referral centers in 10 countries. The median age was 68 (51-77) years, and 174 (46,6%) of the patients were females. The median hospitalization time of the patients was 15 (10-21) days. Overall mortality rate due to CA sepsis was 17.7% (n = 66). The possible predictors which have strong correlation and the variables that cause collinearity are acute oliguria, altered consciousness, persistent hypotension, fever, serum creatinine, age, and serum total protein. CAS (%) is a new scoring system and works in accordance with the parameters in third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3). The system has yielded successful results in terms of predicting mortality in CA sepsis patients."
19943601,Spontaneous intrahepatic gas gangrene and fatal septic shock.,2009,"Gas gangrene of the liver is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a high rate of mortality. It is mostly associated with malignancy and immunosuppression. We report on a male patient who presented at the department of emergency medicine with high fever but no localised complaints. CT scan revealed a cavitary lesion filled with air in the liver. Clostridium perfringens was proved to be present in the hepatic lesion and the blood, and clostridium perfringens sepsis with gas gangrene of the liver was diagnosed. Despite early diagnosis and treatment the patient died. The importance of ""an aggressive treatment policy"" in this kind of life-threatening disease is emphasised."
41479625,[Efficiency and Usefulness of the Molecular Test 'Biofire((R))Filmarray((R)) Blood Culture Identification 2' in the Quick Diagnosis of Bacteraemias in a Burns Intensive Care Unit].,2025,"The occurrence of bacteremia during a hospital stay worsens the prognosis of patients. Especially in burn patients, it is one of the most severe infectious complications during their stay in intensive care units, with high mortality rates. Consequently, rapid detection of the pathogens responsible is crucial for the prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy. In our study, we analysed 85 positive blood cultures collected from 66 patients hospitalised in the burns unit and presenting criteria for sepsis. The results of the molecular test FilmArray BCID2 were compared with those of conventional microbiology methods. Overall, the results of the BCID2 panel were concordant with those of conventional culture in 71.8% of cases. For monomicrobial cultures, the concordance of identification was 83.9%, while for polymicrobial cultures the concordance was 36.4%. The test showed a good performance in the detection of pathogens, with an overall sensitivity of 84.5% and specificity of 98.3%; for the panel targets these rates rose to 95.4% and 98.1% respectively. For resistance genes, the BCID2 detected the blaCTX-M gene in 9 enterobacteria and the carbapenemase genes: blaNDM, blaOXA-48- like, blaVIM in 20 BGN. The mecA/C gene was isolated from 5 Staphylococcus epidermidis and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus the vanA/B gene was detected in 3 Enterococcus faecuim. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for detecting resistance genes were 84.1% and 92%. The turnaround time (TAT) for molecular test results was 1 hour and 10min (Q1 1.09 h; Q3 1.12 h). The median TAT for BCID2 was significantly (Mann-Whitney, p<0.0001) shorter than for conventional culture 39.1 h (Q1 33 h; Q3 57.6 h). Antimicrobial therapy was modified on the basis of the molecular test results in 35.3% of patients. This was done within a median of 04 hours of receiving the test result [interquartile range 2.4h - 21h]. A favorable outcome was noted in 70% of these patients."
25518312,Mortality rate among patients with septic shock after implementation of 6-hour sepsis protocol in the emergency department of Thammasat University Hospital.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a major healthcare problem effecting people worldwide with high mortality rate. Administering early and appropriate interventions can help improve the outcome. The 6-hour bundle, launched by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign committee was part of efforts to incorporate evidence-based guideline to clinical practice. There were many reports on outcome improvement of septic shock patients after implementation of the 6-hour bundle at the emergency department. OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality rate of septic shockpatients before and after implementing the 6-hour sepsis protocol at the emergency department of Thammasat University Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study was conducted at the emergency department of Thammasat University Hospital. This is an interrupted time, before and after study, comparing between the prospective cohort period after (Oct 2012 to Nov 2013) and the historical control period before (Feb 2011 to July 2012) implementation of 6-hour sepsis protocol. Primary outcome was hospital mortality of septic shock patients. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and predictive factors for mortality ofseptic shock patients. RESULTS: There were 80patients included in the pre-intervention group and 75patients in the post-intervention group. There was significant improvement in management of septic shock patients. Totalfluid given in 2 hours in the post-intervention group was significantly higher[2,000 (500-3,000) vs. 1,600 (100-3,600);p = 0.038)] when compared with thepre-intervention group. The entire resuscitation bundles compliance rate was significantly increased in the post-intervention group (37.3% vs. 0%; p<O. 001). Regarding each intervention in the 6-hour bundle, included serum lactate measurement, giving fluid bolus >/=500 ml and maintaining MAP>/=65 mmHg, were all significantly increased in rate ofcompliance (96.0% vs. 2.5%; p<0.001, 100.0% vs. 92.3%;p = 0.029, 100.0% vs. 88.8%;p = 0.003, respectively). Hospital mortality was reduced significantly after implementation of the 6-hour sepsis protocol (18.7% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Septic shock mortality was decreased after implementation of the 6-hour sepsis protocol at the emergency department of Thammasat University Hospital."
32127808,Isolation of Janthinobacterium lividum from early onset neonatal sepsis patients in Malaysia.,2019,"BACKGROUND: The term early onset neonatal septicaemia (EONS) refers to invasive bacterial infections that primarily involve the blood stream of neonates during the first 3 days of life. Although early onset neonatal septicaemia is relatively uncommon, it may be associated with case fatality rates of 15-30% and substantial morbidity in surviving infants. OBJECTIVES: This study describes an unusual septicaemia cases with Janthinobacterium lividum in neonatal Intensive Care Units. METHODS: Bacterial causes of early onset neonatal sepsis in Kuala Lumpur Hospital Malaysia were investigated using broad range 16S rDNA PCR and sequencing. The bacterial DNA was isolated directly from blood without pre-incubation. All samples collected were equally cultured and incubated in automated BACTEC system. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty two neonates were recruited in this study with mean (SD) gestational age of 35.9. Neonates with J. lividum infection lacked microbiological evidence of septicaemia as their blood culture yielded no bacterial growth. However, the PCR analysis of these samples yielded 1100bp corresponding to bacteria species. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the value of PCR in detecting bacteria where special growth requirement is involved."
20232569,Epidemiological characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii infections at Phramongkutklao Hospital.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To describe epidemiological characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii infections and identify molecular patterns of A. baumannii isolated from the patients admitted in Phramongkutklao Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study on previously isolated A. baumannii from the clinical specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory of Phramongkutklao Hospital from January to March 2008 were carried out together with molecular typing using PCR-based method. Clinical data were obtained from IC surveillance and patients' records. RESULTS: 114 A. baumannii were isolated from 80 patients. A. baumannii was a cause of healthcare-associated infection (90%, 72 of 80 cases), colonization (7.5%), and community-acquired infection (2.5%) with mortality rate of 50%. Majority of the patients from which A. baumannii were isolated were male (58.8%), age over 60 years (56.3%), diagnosed with lower respiratory diseases (26.3%), had A. baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia (66.7%), and admitted in medical department (57.5%) with median length of hospital stay 35 days. PDR- and MDR- A. baumannii were accounted for 67.5% and 21.1%, respectively. All isolates showed sensitive to tigecycline and colistin. Using PCR-based typing was able to distinguish 6 molecular types among 114 A. baumannii isolates. Molecular type 2 was the most common type (47.4%) and widely spread in 14 wards. Spread of clonally related isolates was found in 14 cases admitted in 8 medical wards and ICUs. CONCLUSION: Multiple clones of PDR- and MDR- A. baumannii were widely spread in the hospital. Clonally related A. baumannii infected 14 cases in 8 wards."
20152281,What's in a name? Eponyms in head and neck imaging.,2010,"Head and neck (H&N) eponyms serve to honour physicians who have made important contributions. Compared with more descriptive diagnostic names, eponyms can sometimes be confusing, especially to the novice. Adding to the confusion, eponyms are sometimes applied incorrectly. Nevertheless, their use remains common in the medical literature and clinical practice. Familiarity with H&N eponyms is important for accurate communication with radiology colleagues and clinicians. Some eponyms describe potentially fatal infections and their urgency should be appreciated. Other eponyms, such as those for inner ear congenital anomalies, are probably best avoided as they can be used imprecisely and cause confusion. This review summarizes the clinical and imaging findings of some common and important H&N eponyms under the following categories of disease: (1) neck infections, (2) diseases in the temporal bone, (3) orbital diseases, and (4) sinus disease."
20022967,Outcomes of patients ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support: a comparative propensity score study.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the benefits of one mode over another for ventilatory support. We set out to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support (SIMV-PS) compared with assist-control (A/C) ventilation as their primary mode of ventilatory support. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of an observational study conducted in 349 ICUs from 23 countries. A propensity score stratified analysis was used to compare 350 patients ventilated with SIMV-PS with 1,228 patients ventilated with A/C ventilation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In a logistic regression model, patients were more likely to receive SIMV-PS if they were from North America, had lower severity of illness, or were ventilated postoperatively or for trauma. SIMV-PS was less likely to be selected if patients were ventilated because of asthma or coma, or if they developed complications such as sepsis or cardiovascular failure during mechanical ventilation. In the stratified analysis according to propensity score, we did not find significant differences in the in-hospital mortality. After adjustment for propensity score, overall effect of SIMV-PS on in-hospital mortality was not significant (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.77-1.42; P = .78). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of ventilated patients, ventilation with SIMV-PS compared with A/C did not offer any advantage in terms of clinical outcomes, despite treatment-allocation bias that would have favored SIMV-PS."
15585504,Antimicrobial resistance of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in a British district general hospital: the international connection.,2004,"Between January 2000 and March 2001, Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from the blood of 56 patients admitted to a single district general hospital in the South-East of England. The serotype and antibiotic susceptibility were determined for all isolates and, for those resistant to erythromycin, the presence or absence of the mef(A) and erm(B) genes was determined by PCR. Multi-locus sequence typing, along with PFGE, was undertaken on all isolates resistant to penicillin or erythromycin and a group of antibiotic-susceptible isolates, to identify whether globally distributed pneumococcal clones, as described by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN), were present in the study population. Three serotype 9V penicillin-resistant isolates were identified as belonging to the Spain9V-3 clone, while 14 erythromycin-resistant isolates of serotype 14 belonged to the England14-9 clone. A single multi-resistant isolate of serotype 6B, was found to be a single-locus variant of the Spain6B-2 clone. All 14 erythromycin-resistant serotype 14 isolates possessed the mef(A) gene, while the single multi-resistant isolate possessed the erm(B) gene. These findings confirm the wide distribution and clinical impact of PMEN clones, which accounted for all of the penicillin and erythromycin resistance observed amongst invasive isolates in a district general hospital over a 15-month period."
15779166,[Role of nitric oxide in diaphragmatic dysfunction genesis during sepsis in rats].,2000,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator agent that is cytotoxic and negatively inotropic in the heart. More recently, it has been shown that during sepsis there is a high amount of NO production by a NO synthase (NOS) that is inducible by cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NO in the genesis of diaphragmatic dysfunction during sepsis. Rats were inoculated i.p. injection with 10 mg/kg of Escherichia coil endotoxin (E animals) or saline (C animals). Six hours after endotoxin or saline inoculation, diaphragmatic force and muscularc GMP (Cyclic guanosine monophosphate) were assessed by in vitro force frequency curves and ELISA method, respectively. As compared to C animals, E animals showed a significant decrease in diaphragmatic force for all the frequencies of stimulation (p < 0.01). This reduction was associated with a significant increase in muscular cGMP. Inhibition of NO synthesis in E animals with either dexamethasone (4 mg/kg IV, 45 min before endotoxin or saline) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 8 mg/kg IV, 90 min after endotoxin or saline) prevented the effects of endotoxin. However, no modification was seen with NG-monomethyl-D-arginine (D-NMMA), a molecule which does not inhibit NO synthesis. Administration of dexamethasone or L-NMMA in C animals did not induce any significant change in diaphragmatic force, and cGMP ratio. We conclude that NO has a contributive role in diaphragmatic dysfunction during Escherichia coli induced sepsis in rats."
15729980,[Azlocillin plus amikacin: an alternative therapy for sepsis caused by resistant staphylococci?].,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of combined therapy with azlocillin and amikacin in a group of neonates with sepsis caused by multiresistant staphylococci who were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of Hospital Ginecobstetrico ""America Arias"" in Havana, Cuba, from 1998 to 2000. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out of the clinical and laboratory results obtained in 15 patients with sepsis caused by multiresistant staphylococci who received combined therapy with azlocillin and amikacin, according to hospital guidelines on the use of antibiotics. We used a broth microdilution method to study the patterns of resistance shown by isolated strains to 10 of the antibiotics in use. In vitro synergy tests, specifically the checkerboard technique with microtitration plates, were used to observe the effects of treatment in 8 patients. RESULTS: Twelve coagulase-negative staphylococci and three Staphylococcus aureus isolates showed five different patterns of resistance on the basis of their sensitivity to oxacillin, three aminoglycosides, and vancomycin. Six of the synergy tests showed a considerable synergistic effect, with an average three-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the two antibiotics used to treat the patients. No antagonistic effects were noted, and the combined antibiotics showed an overall clinical effectiveness of 91.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The test showed that the therapeutic combination used was effective, but further studies are needed before conclusive results are obtained."
15859907,Conversion from tacrolimus to cyclosporine--a based immunosuppression following liver transplantation.,2003,"We examined the frequency, reasons and outcome after conversion from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A. From August 1989 to December 1992, 1000 consecutive liver transplantation patients were studied, which included 834 adults (age>18 yr.) and 166 children with mean follow-up of 77 months (range 56 to 96). A prospectively populated electronic database was queried to identify patients that underwent conversion, the clinical indication and outcomes. Thirty-seven out of 834 adult recipients (4.43%), mean age of 48.4+/-12.9 years, 19 male (51.35%) and 18 females (48.64%) required conversion from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A baseline immunosuppressive therapy. No pediatric patient required conversion. The mean time interval from liver transplantation to Cyclosporine A conversion was 443.45+/-441.44 days (range 22 to 1641). The clinical indications for conversion included: 20 neurological (54%), 6 gastrointestinal (16%), 5 hematological (14%), and 6 other (16%) scenarios. Seven of the 37 patients (18.9%) died. The causes of death were multi-organ failure (2), sepsis (2), pancreatitis (1), hepatic failure due to relapse of ethanol abuse (1), and unknown cause (1). Nine out of 37 patients (24.32%) had to be reconverted to Tacrolimus (mean 282.22+/-499.79 days; range 15 to 1583 day with a median of 135) after institution of Cyclosporine A; none showed recurrence of the original symptoms. The reasons for these re-conversions were acute cellular rejection (44%, n=4), chronic rejection (11%, n=1), increased hepatic enzymes (33%, n=3) and progressively worsening neurological symptoms (11%, n=1). The frequency of conversion from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A was 4.43%. Conversion is safe and efficacious if done in a controlled setting. Additionally, re-conversion to Tacrolimus for lack of efficacy of Cyclosporine A did not appear to be associated with a recurrence of the condition that caused the initial switch."
25551376,Comparing Leishman and Giemsa staining for the assessment of peripheral blood smear preparations in a malaria-endemic region in India.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Microscopy of peripheral blood thin and thick films remains the reference for malaria diagnosis. Although Giemsa staining is most commonly used, the Leishman staining method provides better visualization of the nuclear chromatin pattern of cells. It is less well known whether accuracy of parasitaemia assessment is equally accurate with the latter method. METHODS: Peripheral blood thin and thick smears from consecutive febrile patients admitted to Ispat General hospital, Rourkela, Odhisa, India, were stained with Giemsa and Leishman stain. Methods were compared for species identification, parasite quantification, and ability for identification of alternative diagnoses. RESULTS: Blood films from 1,180 fever patients were compared according to staining method, of which 111 were identified as parasitaemic using Giemsa and 110 with Leishman staining. The Kappa value as a measure of agreement between methods was 0.995 (p < 0.001), and the log10parasitaemia between methods were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.9981). In parasite negative patients, thin smear assessment contributed to making a diagnosis in 276/1,180 (23%) of cases. These assessments were better made in Leishman-stained preparations, especially for the assessment of morphological changes in red and white cells. CONCLUSION: Leishman's staining method for thin and thick smears is a good alternative to Giemsa's stain for identifying Plasmodium parasites. The Leishman method is superior for visualization of red and white blood cell morphology."
41517447,Cetirizine and Dexamethasone in Sepsis: Insights into Maresin-1 Signaling and Cytokine Regulation.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality, yet its etiopathogenesis is still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cetirizine and dexamethasone (alone and in combination) on serum levels of Maresin-1 (MaR-1), TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in a rat model of sepsis induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8-10 weeks were used and randomly divided into 7 groups, each containing 7 rats: Group 1 (Control), Group 2 (Sham), Group 3 (Sepsis), Group 4 (Sepsis + Saline), Group 5 (Sepsis + Cetirizine), Group 6 (Sepsis + Dexamethasone), and Group 7 (Sepsis + Cetirizine + Dexamethasone). Sepsis was induced via CLP in all groups except Control and Sham. Results: In the sepsis groups (G3-G7), neutrophil and white blood cell counts increased while lymphocyte counts decreased (p < 0.05). In groups treated with cetirizine and/or dexamethasone (G5-G7), a significant decrease in neutrophils and an increase in lymphocytes were observed. MaR-1 levels significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in all sepsis-induced groups compared to controls, while interleukin levels significantly increased. Cetirizine and dexamethasone supplementation significantly increased MaR-1 levels and decreased interleukin levels (p < 0.05). The combined treatment was more effective. Conclusions: This study is the first to highlight the potential of MaR-1 as a critical biomarker in sepsis diagnosis and monitoring, and cetirizine and dexamethasone, especially in combination, may represent a promising therapeutic option in sepsis management."
41488477,In-host co-colonization and bloodstream infection by distinct classical and hypervirulent CRKP clones harboring a homologous bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid.,2025,"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) readily colonizes clinical environments as well as the respiratory and intestinal tracts of patients and can easily cause secondary infections, posing a serious threat to infection treatment and hospital infection control. In this study, we continuously tracked CRKP strains isolated from a single patient over a total of 16 weeks-from admission to the ICU until discharge from the general ward. A total of 21 CRKP strains were obtained, including 1 bloodstream infection (BSI) isolate, 8 respiratory tract colonization isolates, and 12 intestinal colonization isolates. All isolates were evaluated for their phenotypic characteristics related to antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity, and plasmid transfer through antimicrobial susceptibility testing, mouse infection models, and conjugation experiments. In parallel, whole-genome sequencing was performed to determine their MLST types, capsular serotypes, resistance and virulence genes, and plasmid profiles. The results showed that these isolates belonged to two distinct clones. One BSI isolate, along with one respiratory and one intestinal colonization isolate, belonged to the ST268 with capsular serotype KL20. This clone carried not only the typical hypervirulence (hv) genes aerobactin, colibactin, and rmpA2 but also a plasmid encoding bla (KPC-2), representing a classic CR-hvKP strain. Mouse infection models confirmed its high virulence. The remaining isolates belonged to the ST4496 clone, a member of the CC11 clonal complex commonly found in ICU outbreaks, with serotype KL47, exhibiting lower pathogenicity but carrying the same bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid as ST268, indicating horizontal plasmid transfer. In-host co-colonization by the distinct CRKP clones ST4496 and ST268 may have facilitated horizontal transfer of the bla (KPC-2)-harboring plasmid, enabling ST268 to evolve from hvKP into CR-hvKP and subsequently cause secondary BSI. This process, in which pathogen clones with different traits co-colonize and mutually promote evolutionary changes, may interfere with clinical treatment decisions and underscores the need for more intensive hospital infection surveillance."
19943598,Internal herniation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: case reports and a review of the literature.,2009,"Internal herniation, defined as a protrusion of the bowel through a peritoneal or mesenteric aperture into a compartment of the abdominal cavity, is a potentially serious complication following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In view of the high risk of strangulation and volvulus with possible progression to necrotic bowel, sepsis and multiple organ failure, early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are crucial to minimise morbidity and mortality rates. As little is known about internal herniation, pathogenesis, consequences, clinical presentation and diagnostic approach are discussed in this article. A review of the literature and the consideration of three cases make it clear that diagnosis is often delayed due to a vague, non-specific clinical presentation and the frequently negative radiological investigations. Displacement of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with crowding, stretching and engorgement of its visceral branches, mesenteric swirl and a clustered appearance of small bowel loops are CT findings with a high specificity but low sensitivity. A high degree of vigilance, communication between radiologists and surgeons and a low threshold for surgical exploration is therefore necessary."
19943588,Endovascular treatment of symptomatic and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.,2009,"AIM: To report our early experience with endovascular treatment of symptomatic and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) using the Talent bifurcated stent graft. PATIENTS-METHODS: From August 2003 to May 2007 nine patients with symptomatic AAA (sAAA) (two after previous endovascular repair and endoleak), and eleven patients with ruptured AAA (rAAA) (one with ruptured iliac aneurysm and one with spontaneous aortic rupture) were treated endovascularly. Seven bifurcated stent grafts, (six Talent), and two iliac extensions were implanted into the patients with sAAA, and nine bifurcated stent grafts (eight Talent) and two aorto-uniliacs were implanted into the patients with rAAA. RESULTS: The deployment of the endovascular device in the intended location was successful in all patients. There was no conversion to open surgery. One patient with sAAA died after stroke and sepsis resulting in 11.1% 30-day mortality in this group. One required re-intervention for a type I endoleak before his discharge. Eight patients were discharged and during a follow-up period of 4-42 months (median 18 months) they have remained well. Two patients with rAAA died in the 30-day postoperative period. Thirty-day mortality was 18.1%. An unintended occlusion of one renal artery was performed. There were 9 survivors. During a follow-up period of 17-45 months (median 26 months) one more died of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Initial experience with endovascular treatment of patients with symptomatic or ruptured AAA, using the Talent bifurcated stent graft is promising. Bifurcated endografts can be implanted into patients with rAAA. A larger number of patients and longer follow-up is necessary to arrive at more reliable conclusions."
41472286,"Differences in the Phenotype of Bacterial and Viral Sepsis-A Prospective, Multicenter, Observational Study.",2025,"Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to an infection, leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction. While sepsis is most commonly the result of a bacterial infection, it may also be caused by viral pathogens. The aim of this study was to describe differences in organ dysfunction patterns and inflammatory markers between bacterial and viral sepsis. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, adults meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria were recruited from four Austrian ICUs between 1 August 2021 and 1 April 2024, excluding those who were immunocompromised within the preceding 12 months. Ninety patients were enrolled, of whom 57 had bacterial and 33 viral sepsis. Inflammatory markers, including IL-6 and PCT, were higher at ICU admission in bacterial sepsis. Adjusted linear regression confirmed bacterial etiology as the only significant predictor of higher 48 h peak IL-6 and PCT values. Patients with viral sepsis typically fulfilled SEPSIS-3 criteria through respiratory and cardiovascular SOFA components, while other organ dysfunctions were less frequent. Significant differences in the phenotype of bacterial and viral sepsis were observed, characterized by distinct inflammatory profiles and differing patterns of organ dysfunction. These findings may support the improved differentiation of bacterial and viral etiologies in sepsis."
25536257,Cause-specific risk of hospital admission related to extreme heat in older adults.,2014,"IMPORTANCE: Heat exposure is known to have a complex set of physiological effects on multiple organ systems, but current understanding of the health effects is mostly based on studies investigating a small number of prespecified health outcomes such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. OBJECTIVES: To identify possible causes of hospital admissions during extreme heat events and to estimate their risks using historical data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Matched analysis of time series data describing daily hospital admissions of Medicare enrollees (23.7 million fee-for-service beneficiaries [aged >/=65 years] per year; 85% of all Medicare enrollees) for the period 1999 to 2010 in 1943 counties in the United States with at least 5 summers of near-complete (>95%) daily temperature data. EXPOSURES: Heat wave periods, defined as 2 or more consecutive days with temperatures exceeding the 99th percentile of county-specific daily temperatures, matched to non-heat wave periods by county and week. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily cause-specific hospitalization rates by principal discharge diagnosis codes, grouped into 283 disease categories using a validated approach. RESULTS: Risks of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infection, septicemia, and heat stroke were statistically significantly higher on heat wave days relative to matched non-heat wave days, but risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure was lower (P < .05). Relative risks for these disease groups were 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.25) for fluid and electrolyte disorders, 1.14 (95% CI, 1.06-1.23) for renal failure, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.16) for urinary tract infections, 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00-1.11) for septicemia, and 2.54 (95% CI, 2.14-3.01) for heat stroke. Absolute risk differences were 0.34 (95% CI, 0.22-0.46) excess admissions per 100,000 individuals at risk for fluid and electrolyte disorders, 0.25 (95% CI, 0.12-0.39) for renal failure, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.09-0.39) for urinary tract infections, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.01-0.41) for septicemia, and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.10-0.22) for heat stroke. For fluid and electrolyte disorders and heat stroke, the risk of hospitalization increased during more intense and longer-lasting heat wave periods (P < .05). Risks were generally highest on the heat wave day but remained elevated for up to 5 subsequent days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older adults, periods of extreme heat were associated with increased risk of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infection, septicemia, and heat stroke. However, the absolute risk increase was small and of uncertain clinical importance."
20036226,Empirical models for dosage optimization of four beta-lactams in critically ill septic patients based on therapeutic drug monitoring of amikacin.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to develop empirical models able to predict the pharmacokinetics (PK) of four beta-lactams using the amikacin (AMK) therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in order to optimize their dosage regimens. DESIGN AND METHODS: 69 critically ill septic patients were included. All received a first dose of AMK combined with piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime or meropenem. A multivariate analysis was performed to predict the beta-lactam PK using AMK PK parameters estimated from TDM and using pathophysiological variables. RESULTS: An optimal prediction model was identified for each PK parameter of each beta-lactam. The best predictor of each model was one of the AMK PK parameters estimated from TDM. Other variables included colloid solution, renal and hepatic biomarkers, age and body weight. CONCLUSION: PK of the four beta-lactams could be easily and rapidly predicted in critically ill septic patients using the AMK TDM. These predictions could improve the beta-lactam dosages in clinical practice."
31928632,Effect of Augmented Antimicrobial Prophylaxis and Rectal Swab Culture-guided Targeted Prophylaxis on the Risk of Sepsis Following Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a severe complication following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPBx). Ciprofloxacin is commonly used for prophylaxis; however, there is an increasing incidence of resistant enteric organisms worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a targeted prophylactic antimicrobial regimen based on rectal swab cultures in reducing the rate of sepsis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1012 patients were included. Group A (609 patients) received an empirical prophylactic antimicrobial regimen of gentamicin, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin. Targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis was introduced due to significant ciprofloxacin and gentamicin resistance in patients admitted with sepsis following TRUSPBx. The remaining 403 patients (Group B) had rectal swab cultures performed prior to biopsy. Patients with organisms resistant to ciprofloxacin or gentamicin received a targeted prophylaxis regimen of fosfomycin, amikacin, and metronidazole. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We retrospectively collected and analysed data on sepsis and bacteraemia for all patients as well as data on rectal swab culture, recent foreign travel, and recent antibiotic use for patients in Group B. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In group A, 12 (2.0%) patients developed sepsis following TRUSPBx, while in group B, 9 (2.2%) patients developed sepsis despite targeted prophylaxis (p=0.82). Patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora had a significantly higher rate of sepsis (9.1% vs 1.1%; p=0.003). There was a reduction in patients admitted with bacteraemia and severe sepsis between group A (1.2%) and group B (0.3%) which did not reach statistical significance (p=0.16). In group B, 55 of 403 (13.6%) patients had ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora, while 66 (16.4%) had organisms resistant to both ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. A recent foreign travel history was associated with an increased incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora (23.6% vs 10.8%; p=0.007). The main limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and potential under-reporting of less severe infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal swab cultures identify patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora who have an eight-fold risk of sepsis. Targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis may not be beneficial in reducing the sepsis rate when compared with augmented empirical prophylaxis. In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, transperineal prostate biopsies should be considered to reduce the risk of infective complications. PATIENT SUMMARY: Performing rectal swab culture prior to transrectal prostate biopsy can help identify patients at risk of developing sepsis despite targeted prophylactic antibiotics."
41448106,Validation of the phoenix sepsis score in the pediatric emergency department.,2026,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the discriminative performance of the Phoenix sepsis score (PSS) and compare its performance with the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) criteria in predicting in-hospital mortality and bloodstream infection (BSI) among pediatric patients with suspected sepsis presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on pediatric patients (< 0.001), 28-day (p < 0.001), overall mortality (p = 0.001), and BSI (p = 0.032). At a threshold of PSS >/= 2, it outperformed the IPSCC criteria in specificity (0.94 vs. 0.48 for 3-day; 0.95 vs. 0.48 for 28-day and overall mortality; 0.95 vs. 0.49 for BSI) and diagnostic accuracy (0.94 vs. 0.48 for 3-day, 28-day, and overall mortality; 0.93 vs. 0.49 for BSI), all p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: The PSS outperformed the IPSCC criteria in predicting in-hospital mortality among children with suspected sepsis presenting to the ED, and may serve as a feasible prognostic tool."
15613925,Drotrecogin alfa activated (recombinant human activated protein C) in combination with heparin or melagatran: effects on prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.,2004,"Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) has recently been demonstrated to be a promising candidate to improve the outcome for patients with severe sepsis. Plasma-derived activated protein C and unfractionated heparin (UH) exert anticoagulant synergy due to mechanisms that simultaneously decrease thrombin generation. Melagatran, a new direct thrombin inhibitor, does not bind to plasma proteins or requires antithrombin as a cofactor. The latter is often consumed in patients with severe sepsis. We investigated the anticoagulant efficiency in combined administration of rhAPC and UH or melagatran in terms of prolongation of the standard clotting assays activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) in pooled plasma samples in vitro. RhAPC dose-dependently prolonged the aPTT but not the PT. The ability of UH and melagatran to prolong the aPTT was significantly enhanced in combination with rhAPC. The combined administration of rhAPC and melagatran, but not UH, resulted in additive prolongation of the PT. In control measurements the capability of rhAPC to suppress prothrombin fragment 1.2 generation dose-dependently increased in combination with heparin and melagatran. Our study demonstrates the respective effects of rhAPC, UH, melagatran and further different additive effects in combined administration of rhAPC and UH or melagatran on the prolongation of the aPTT and PT clotting assays usually used to monitor anticoagulant treatment."
19958891,Cryofibrinogenemia: new insights into clinical and pathogenic features.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: Cryofibrinogenemia is an under-recognized cryoprotein that can be life-threatening when untreated. Our aim was to describe the prevalence and clinical findings of patients with cryofibrinogenemia and to clarify the mechanisms involved. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2006, 2312 patients were tested for cryofibrinogenemia in a single university hospital. A total of 515 patients had positive test results, of whom 455 (88.3%) had an associated cryoglobulin. RESULTS: Sixty patients (11.7%) with persistent cryofibrinogenemia and without cryoglobulin were included in the study. Main clinical manifestations related to cryofibrinogenemia included purpura (46.6%), skin necrosis (36.6%), and arthralgia (31.6%) with cold sensitivity in 40%. Overall thrombotic events occurred in up to 40% of cases. Cryofibrinogen plasma concentration was 2 times greater in patients with thrombotic events (P=.012). Complications included gangrene (5%), septicemia (5%), and leg amputation (3.3%). Complete remission of cryofibrinogenemia was achieved in 78% of patients receiving antithrombotic agents, steroids, or immunosuppressants, whereas 41.6% of patients experienced a relapse after a median time of 9 months (range 7-42 months). After a mean follow-up of 85 months, 3 patients died of sepsis (n=2) and cardiovascular disease (n=1). Fibrinolysis status analyzed in a patient with cryofibrinogenemia showed an increase in fibrinolysis inhibitor levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, alpha-2 macroglobulin, and euglobulin lysis time, which normalized after fibrinolytic therapy. CONCLUSION: Essential cryofibrinogenemia represents 12% of all the cryoproteins at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital. Thrombotic events are frequent and could be associated with the amount of plasma cryofibrinogen. Defects in the fibrinolysis process might lead to cryofibrinogen accumulation and clotting in small and medium arteries."
19955282,Rapid identification of bacteria in positive blood culture broths by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.,2010,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid, accurate method for identifying bacteria and fungi recovered on agar culture media. We report herein a method for the direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture broths by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 212 positive cultures were examined, representing 32 genera and 60 species or groups. The identification of bacterial isolates by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was compared with biochemical testing, and discrepancies were resolved by gene sequencing. No identification (spectral score of < 1.7) was obtained for 42 (19.8%) of the isolates, due most commonly to insufficient numbers of bacteria in the blood culture broth. Of the bacteria with a spectral score of > or = 1.7, 162 (95.3%) of 170 isolates were correctly identified. All 8 isolates of Streptococcus mitis were misidentified as being Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. This method provides a rapid, accurate, definitive identification of bacteria within 1 h of detection in positive blood cultures with the caveat that the identification of S. pneumoniae would have to be confirmed by an alternative test."
41472805,The role of gut microbiota in the onset and development of sepsis and its therapeutic potential: mechanisms and research progress.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease triggered by infection-induced immune dysregulation, characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, and is one of the leading causes of death among critically ill patients worldwide. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance plays a crucial role in the progression of sepsis. This review identifies the core mechanisms of GM imbalance: it disrupts the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, induces bacterial and endotoxin translocation, activates systemic inflammatory responses, and forms a vicious cycle of ""gut-organ"" cross-damage, becoming a key driver of sepsis-associated multi-organ dysfunction. Existing research has confirmed that microbiota modulation strategies, such as probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have potential therapeutic value. However, due to issues like strain specificity, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient clinical evidence, the clinical translation of these strategies still faces significant barriers. Therefore, future research should focus on the identification of sepsis-specific GM core functional biomarkers, the development of personalized combined regulatory strategies, and the advancement of targeted delivery technologies. Multi-center large-scale clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety, providing innovative solutions for precision treatment of sepsis."
20058690,"[A case of secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, complicated with disseminated M. abscessus infection].",2009,"A 27-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of a persistent high fever since August 2007. Chest radiography showed infiltration shadows in the right lower lung field. Chest CT revealed scattered small nodular shadows and patchy consolidations in the right lower lobe. He was diagnosed as secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (sPAP) associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), confirmed by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and bone marrow aspiration. Sera were negative for anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibody. He developed a subcutaneous abscess and meningitis caused by M. absessus after VATS. After a long-course of antibiotic therapy, an allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was performed. But he died of graft versus host disease and M. abscessus sepsis 87 days after transplantation."
31866778,Organ Dysfunction in Sepsis: An Ominous Trajectory From Infection To Death.,2019,"Sepsis is a highly complex and lethal syndrome with highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations that makes it difficult to detect and treat. It is also one of the major and most urgent global public health challenges. More than 30 million people are diagnosed with sepsis each year, with 5 million attributable deaths and long-term sequalae among survivors. The current international consensus defines sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Over the past decades substantial research has increased the understanding of its pathophysiology. The immune response induces a severe macro and microcirculatory dysfunction that leads to a profound global hypoperfusion, injuring multiple organs. Consequently, patients with sepsis might present dysfunction of virtually any system, regardless of the site of infection. The organs more frequently affected are kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, central nervous system, and hematologic system. This multiple organ failure is the hallmark of sepsis and determines patients' course from infection to recovery or death. There are tools to assess the severity of the disease that can also help to guide treatment, like the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. However, sepsis disease process is vastly heterogeneous, which could explain why interventions targeted to directly intervene its mechanisms have shown unsuccessful results and predicting outcomes with accuracy is still elusive. Thus, it is required to implement strong public health strategies and leverage novel technologies in research to improve outcomes and mitigate the burden of sepsis and septic shock worldwide."
15657670,A ten-year study of penetrating injuries of the colon.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Colon injury has been associated with a high risk of septic complications and mortality. We prospectively studied the pattern, management, outcome, and prognostic factors in patients who sustained penetrating colon injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients who presented to our hospital with penetrating colon injuries over a ten-year period (1992 to 2001) were studied. RESULTS: Colon wounds were caused by gunshots in 55 (91.7 percent) patients and knife stabs in 5 (8.3 percent). There was a delay of more than 12 hours before laparotomy in 30 (50 percent) patients. Moderate or major fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity occurred in 58 (96.7 percent) patients. The average penetrating abdominal trauma index score was 25.9 and 20 (33.3 percent) patients sustained Flint Grade 3 colon injury. Associated intra-abdominal injuries occurred in the small bowel (73.3 percent), liver (25 percent), stomach (23.3 percent), and mesentery (16.7 percent). Right colon wounds (35) were managed by primary repair in 24 (68.6 percent) patients and proximal diverting colostomy in 11 (31.4 percent), whereas left colon wounds (25) were managed by diverting colostomy in 22 (88.0 percent) patients and primary repair in 3 (12.0 percent) patients. Common complications included wound infection (56.7 percent), septicemia (31.7 percent), and enterocutaneous fistula (16.7 percent). The overall mortality rate was 33.3 percent and colon injury-related mortality was 21.7 percent. Presence of destructive colon injury was associated with a greater than fourfold increased incidence of death. Other significant risk factors included shock on admission, major fecal contamination, duration of operation more than four hours, penetrating abdominal trauma index score >25, and more than two postoperative complications. There was no difference in outcome between patients who had primary repair and those undergoing diverting colostomy. Colostomy closure-related morbidity was 21 percent and mortality was 5.3 percent. CONCLUSION: A more liberal use of primary repair is required in our patients with penetrating injuries of the colon."
20046116,Use of electrophysiologic testing.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: To define the electrophysiologic tests to diagnose critical illness myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy in intensive care unit patients. DESIGN: Literature review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Critical illness myopathy and neuropathy are common complications in the critically ill patient. Myopathy and neuropathy are equally common, and often coexist. Electrophysiological alterations of peripheral nerves and muscle have an early onset in the first days of intensive care unit stay or shortly after sepsis, and precede the structural alterations. Conventional electrophysiologic evaluation can be performed easily on most intensive care unit patients, including patients with altered consciousness; in conjunction with direct muscle stimulation, it can differentiate myopathy from neuropathy, which might be important to define the long-term prognosis. However, electrophysiologic tests are not universally available; their interpretation requires special expertise; and their application is time consuming. A recently proposed simplified test of peroneal nerve stimulation could be used as a screening method to select patients who merit in-depth neurologic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of neuromuscular alterations by means of electrophysiologic tests may be of value for targeted treatments and to anticipate the risk of short-term disability. Complete neurologic and electrophysiological evaluation is important to define the risk of long-term disability after intensive care unit discharge."
41402768,Outcomes of pull-through surgery among children with Hirschsprung's disease in Tanzania: a comparative study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) has been performed through different techniques throughout the surgical history. All techniques evolve through a process of seeking optimal surgical outcomes. Our center has been using two main techniques to address the effects of Swenson and Rehbein's procedure. Reports are inconclusive regarding which technique provides optimal outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review and compare outcomes between Swenson's and Rehbein's procedures in a sub-Saharan African cohort. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients who underwent Pullthrough (PT) surgery at a tertiary hospital. The primary outcome of the study was bowel performance following surgery. Chi X(2) and Fisher's exact tests were used. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to detect any associations among the outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 55 patients were reviewed, and 49 were analyzed. These patients underwent surgery between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2020. Thirty-one patients underwent the Swenson procedure. A total of 75% of the patients who underwent Swenson's procedure had good bowel performance after surgery, whereas only 33% of those who underwent the Rehbein's procedure had good bowel performance (p = 0.01). The two procedures were comparable in terms of the amount of time needed. The complication rate was higher in Rehbein's procedure (77%, 14/19) than in Swenson's procedure (41%, 13/31). Constipation and residual aganglionotic segments were found mainly during Rehbein's procedure. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The Swenson pull-through technique demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the Rehbein procedure, with fewer postoperative complications and improved bowel function. These findings support the Swenson approach as the preferred surgical option in our setting. Nonetheless, prospective studies are recommended to validate these results and explore long-term functional outcomes."
25550313,Cecal ligation and puncture accelerates development of ventilator-induced lung injury.,2015,"Sepsis is a leading cause of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, but the interaction between sepsis and ventilation is unclear. While prior studies demonstrated a priming role with endotoxin, actual septic animal models have yielded conflicting results regarding the role of preceding sepsis on development of subsequent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Using a rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis and subsequent injurious ventilation, we sought to determine if sepsis affects development of VILI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subject to CLP or sham operation and, after 12 h, underwent injurious mechanical ventilation (tidal volume 30 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure 0 cmH2O) for either 0, 60, or 120 min. Biochemical and physiological measurements, as well as computed tomography, were used to assess injury at 0, 60, and 120 min of ventilation. Before ventilation, CLP rats had higher levels of alveolar neutrophils and interleukin-1beta. After 60 min of ventilation, CLP rats had worse injury as evidenced by increased alveolar inflammation, permeability, respiratory static compliance, edema, oxygenation, and computed tomography. By 120 min, CLP and sham rats had comparable levels of lung injury as assessed by many, but not all, of these metrics. CLP rats had an accelerated and worse loss of end-expiratory lung volume relative to sham, and consistently higher levels of alveolar interleukin-1beta. Loss of aeration and progression of edema was more pronounced in dependent lung regions. We conclude that CLP initiated pulmonary inflammation in rats, and accelerated the development of subsequent VILI."
41399492,Identification of Co-Diagnostic Genes and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Asthma and Sepsis Through Mendelian Randomization and Immune Infiltration Analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between asthma and sepsis, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study explores the co-diagnostic genes and molecular links between asthma and sepsis using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and bioinformatics methods, and further validates the findings through clinical data, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets and drugs. METHODS: Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) data from an Icelandic population were used for two-sample MR analysis. Differential expression analysis identified common genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses explored biological functions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves validated gene performance, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT. Drug targets were predicted using DrugSigDB and validated by molecular docking. Clinical data of the three groups of people were collected, and baseline analysis, ROC curve analysis, and comparison of the expression levels of CXCL8 were carried out. RESULTS: At the genetic level, 435 genes related to asthma and 1,385 genes related to sepsis were identified, with 141 common genes. Further findings showed that there were 247 differentially expressed genes in asthma and 2,878 differentially expressed genes in sepsis, and 65 common differentially expressed genes were enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. The key gene CXCL8 exhibited excellent diagnostic performance and was closely related to immune cell subsets. Based on the research results, ten potential therapeutic drugs were screened, and seven of them were verified by molecular docking. Clinical sample testing results show that CXCL8 is closely related to asthma and sepsis. CONCLUSION: CXCL8 may be a biomarker for both asthma and sepsis. Immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, and T cells may drive comorbid progression. Potential drug candidates were identified, offering new insights for future research on these diseases."
41451203,Correction: Portfolio analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data unravels immune cells and telomere-related biomarkers in sepsis.,2025,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1638156.].
41474350,Nongonococcal urethritis can come from Neisseria: A case of N. meningitidis urethritis.,2025,"Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative organism known to cause invasive bacterial disease including meningitis and sepsis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a pathogen in the same genus and causes gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted infection that often manifests as urethritis. N. meningitidis can also cause urethritis, yet diagnosis is difficult as it is not detectable on routine gonococcal testing. We present a case of a patient with N. meningitidis urethritis, and discuss the epidemiology and approach to diagnosis and treatment of this illness. It is important to keep N. meningitidis in the differential diagnosis for patients with nongonococcal urethritis."
32071875,Severe sepsis caused by Parvimonas micra identified using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing following patient death.,2020,"An 83-year-old man visited an orthopedic hospital for his lower back pain. A compression fracture was noted in his second lumbar vertebra. He had taken pain medication for approximately five weeks, but the pain had worsened and he was unable to walk by himself. He was transferred to our hospital and diagnosed with lumbar spondylodiscitis, an iliopsoas abscess, gas gangrene of his left lower limb, and left massive pleural effusion. He was admitted to the intensive care unit. We drained the abscess and pleural effusion, provided continuous hemodiafiltration under ventilator control, and administered intravenous antibiotics. However, he died from sepsis and multiple organ failure three days following admission. Several days after his death, gram-positive cocci were identified in blood culture, pus from the abscess, and pleural exudate; although the causative organism could not be identified. Two weeks subsequent to his death, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified Parvimonas micra in specimens taken from his body."
31838482,Bioinformatics Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles for Risk Prediction in Patients with Septic Shock.,2019,"BACKGROUND Septic shock occurs when sepsis is associated with critically low blood pressure, and has a high mortality rate. This study aimed to undertake a bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles for risk prediction in septic shock. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two good quality datasets associated with septic shock were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, GSE64457 and GSE57065. Patients with septic shock had both sepsis and hypotension, and a normal control group was included. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using OmicShare tools based on R. Functional enrichment of DEGs was analyzed using DAVID. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established using STRING. Survival curves of key genes were constructed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0. Each putative central gene was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using MedCalc statistical software. RESULTS GSE64457 and GSE57065 included 130 RNA samples derived from whole blood from 97 patients with septic shock and 33 healthy volunteers to obtain 975 DEGs, 455 of which were significantly down-regulated and 520 were significantly upregulated (P<0.05). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified significantly enriched DEGs in four signaling pathways, MAPK, TNF, HIF-1, and insulin. Six genes, WDR82, ASH1L, NCOA1, TPR, SF1, and CREBBP in the center of the PPI network were associated with septic shock, according to survival curve and ROC analysis. CONCLUSIONS Bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles identified four signaling pathways and six genes, potentially representing molecular mechanisms for the occurrence, progression, and risk prediction in septic shock."
19964557,Spectral analysis of heart period and pulse transit time derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram in sepsis patients.,2009,"Sepsis is a potentially lethal condition, and is one of the major causes of death in non-coronary intensive care units. Sepsis syndrome progresses through a number of increasingly severe stages, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) through sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Each stage of sepsis is potentially characterized by differing autonomic nervous system responses. Spectral analysis of cardiovascular variability has been regarded as a possible non-invasive method to study this autonomic regulation, and in this study, the variabilities of heart period (RRi) and pulse transit time (PTT) derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethys-mogram were investigated in three different groups: normal subjects (n = 11), SIRS (n = 7) and severe sepsis patients (n = 16), by computing spectral and cross-spectral measures in the low-frequency (LF) and the high-frequency (HF) ranges. SIRS and severe sepsis patients were found to have lower RRi (p < 0.01), augmented LF power in PTT (p < 0.01) and a lower RRi-PTT ratio (alpha(PTT)) in the LF and HF bands (p < 0.01) as compared with the normal subjects, which might indicate a suppression of baroreflex-mediated autonomic control of heart rate and an increased sympathetic influence on ventricular contractility in sepsis. The results have highlighted the potential value of spectral analysis of RRi and PTT variabilities as a non-invasive tool for clinical evaluation of cardiac autonomic regulation in sepsis patients."
19943074,Statins for community-acquired pneumonia: current state of the science.,2010,"In spite of the many advances in the diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the mortality associated with this infection remains high. In recent years scientific evidence has emerged that shows that an excessive inflammatory response is a major cause of unfavorable outcome in patients with CAP, especially in the first few days. The use of immunomodulation appears to be an appealing option for improving prognosis in CAP. It has recently been demonstrated that statins have immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects, and the beneficial effects of these drugs in sepsis have been discussed. Experimental studies have shown their effect in the modulation of the cytokine cascade and in the organization of the immunological response to respiratory infection. Most observational studies published to date support the idea that the use of statins may improve the prognosis of CAP. Randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings."
15631168,[Lemierre syndrome: a diagnosis to keep in mind].,2004,"Lemierre syndrome (also called post-anginal sepsis or necrobacillosis) is an uncommon complication of oropharyngeal infections for which early recognition and aggressive therapy is mandatory, since it is potentially life-threatening. Due to it's rarity, with a prevalence of 0.8 cases per million in the general population, many physicians are unfamiliar with this disorder. This is attested by the fact that diagnosis most often relies on bacteriological grounds. We report the case of a patient whose diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein was made by the emergency physicians based upon clinical presentation, allowing for prompt initiation of adequate antibiotherapy. The aim of this report is to enhance general practitioner's and emergency physicians' awareness of this uncommon disorder, which should always be suspected in case of sepsis following an oropharyngeal infection."
41541165,Gallbladder ascariasis complicated by chronic eosinophilic cholecystitis in a one-year-old infant: A case report.,2025,"INTRODUCTION & IMPORTANCE: Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the most prevalent soil-transmitted helminths, affecting up to 1.2 billion people worldwide. Although it mainly inhabits the intestine, migration to the biliary system can occur. Gallbladder involvement is exceptionally rare, particularly in children. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a one-year-old male with recurrent fever, anorexia, vomiting, and weight loss for three months. Past history included neonatal intensive care for hypoplastic lungs, anemia, and sepsis. Examination revealed mild epigastric and right hypochondrial tenderness. Laboratory results showed eosinophilia, and stool analysis confirmed Ascaris ova. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, and a hyperechoic mobile lesion suggestive of Ascaris. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Gallbladder ascariasis is extremely uncommon in infants, with only two previously reported cases under one year of age, which were managed conservatively. Clinical features are nonspecific, overlapping with other gastrointestinal disorders. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice, revealing typical hyperechoic intraluminal structures. In this case, laparoscopic cholecystectomy confirmed a degenerated worm with chronic eosinophilic cholecystitis. While conservative management with anthelmintics is standard, surgery is indicated for complications such as cholecystitis or worm impaction. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, Ascaris lumbricoides may migrate into the gallbladder, resulting in symptomatic cholecystitis. In endemic regions, gallbladder ascariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained gastrointestinal or biliary symptoms. Early recognition through a high index of suspicion and timely ultrasonographic evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management. Peripheral eosinophilia, reflecting the host immune response to parasitic infestation, may provide an additional diagnostic clue."
25734151,Elevated carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide ratio in the exhaled breath of mice treated with a single dose of lipopolysaccharide.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of volatile organic chemicals in breath holds promise for noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of patients, but investigation of this in experimental mouse models has been limited. Of particular interest is endogenous production of carbon monoxide as a biomarker of inflammation and, more particularly, during sepsis. METHODS: Using a nose-only collection procedure for unanesthetized individual adult mice and sensitive gas chromatography of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) of sampled breath, we investigated the responses of mice to one-time injections with different doses of purified Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Two strains of mice were examined: BALB/c and C3H, including an endotoxin-resistant mutant (HeJ) as well as the wild type (HOuJ). RESULTS: The CO to CO2 ratio increased in a dose-responsive manner within hours in treated BALC/c mice but not control mice. The CO/CO2 values declined to the range of control mice within 48-72 h after the injection of lipopolysaccharide. Breath CO/CO2 values correlated with systemic inflammation biomarkers in serum and heme oxygenase-1 gene expression in blood. C3H/HOuJ mice, but not the HeJ mice, had similar increases of the CO/CO2 ratio in response to the endotoxin. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon monoxide concentrations in exhaled breath of at least 2 strains of mice increase in response to single injections of endotoxin. The magnitude of increase was similar to what was observed with a bacteremia model. These findings with an experimental model provide a rationale for further studies of normalized CO concentrations in human breath as an informative biomarker for staging and monitoring of sepsis."
20237446,"Non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholerae bacteraemia in splenectomised thalassaemic patient from Malaysia.",2009,"Vibrio cholerae infection is mainly caused acute diarrhoea disease. Bacteraemia due to non-O1 V. cholerae is rare and mainly reported in liver cirrhotic patients. We report one case of non-O1 V. cholerae bacteraemia in splenectomised thalassaemic patient who presented with septic shock secondary to abdominal sepsis. She had undergone emergency laporatomy and was managed in the intensive care unit for nine days. She was treated with meropenem and doxycyline and discharged well after fourteen days of admission. The V. cholerae was identified by API 20NE, serotype and polymerase chain reaction showed as non-O1, non-O139 strain. Besides known cholera-like toxin and El Tor hemolysin, with increasing reported cases of V. cholerae bacteraemia, there is possibility of other virulence factors that allow this organism to invade the bloodstream."
19949419,Anemia and hypoalbuminemia of chronic spinal cord injury: prevalence and prognostic significance.,2010,"STUDY DESIGN: The study was a retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey a chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) population for the prevalence and prognostic significance of anemia (AN) and hypoalbuminemia (HA). SETTING: The study was conducted at VA Boston Healthcare System, USA. METHODS: A review of records of 322 SCI subjects (318 males) scheduled for annual examination was carried out for the period from 1998 to 2007. The number of follow-up years with AN (hematocrit <40%) or severe anemia (SAN) (hematocrit <30%) or HA (serum albumin <3 g%) was recorded for all subjects, divided between survivor and deceased subjects. RESULTS: A total of 239 subjects survived to an average age of 60 and 30 years of paralysis and 83 subjects died at an average age of 70 and 27 years of paralysis (P<0.01 and P<0.06, respectively). The level and grade of paralysis were similar in these groups. The average prevalence rates of AN, SAN and HA were 34, 6 and 6% of survey years in the survivor group and 83, 18 and 22% in the deceased group; the respective ratios were 2.4, 3.0 and 3.7 (P<0.001). The fractions of survey years that were positive for SAN and/or HA among causes of death were sepsis, 42%; cancer, 33%; pulmonary failure 30%; cardiovascular disease, 25%; and undetermined causes, 9%. The mortality rate for the 95 subjects with a recurrence of SAN or HA was 40% within 3 years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AN, SAN and HA among chronic SCI subjects is high; repeated SAN and HA often precede death, particularly due to sepsis."
31885937,A Delayed Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Shock in a Patient with Alcoholic Cirrhosis and Ascites on Bedside Ultrasound.,2019,"Undifferentiated shock is a common and challenging problem in critical care. We present a case of hemorrhagic shock due to splenic and hepatic lacerations diagnosed by bedside paracentesis, initially misclassified as septic shock due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Case. A 47-year old man with a history of reported alcoholic cirrhosis and ongoing heavy alcohol use was brought to the emergency room after a syncopal event. He was found to be anemic (hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl) and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 64/34. Despite crystalloid infusion he remained hypotensive and required vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Bedside ultrasound revealed moderate ascites and as there was no evidence of active bleeding, his shock was attributed to sepsis due to SBP. A bedside paracentesis was performed which revealed gross blood. A repeat hemoglobin returned at 4.4 g/dl. Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and interventional radiology was emergently consulted due to concerns for intraabdominal hemorrhage; general surgery deemed the patient too unstable for surgical intervention. Angiogram revealed a splenic laceration and possible hepatic laceration, both embolized successfully. Internal medicine practitioners should keep the differential of hemorrhagic shock due to intraabdominal organ injury in mind for patients with undifferentiated shock."
41467899,Dengue Infection in Pediatric Patients With Malignancies: A Single-center Retrospective Study.,2026,"Dengue infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile neutropenia in endemic areas, even in the absence of warning signs. A retrospective audit was done on medical records of patients (age 14 y or younger) who were diagnosed with dengue fever from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 in a tertiary care cancer center. Patients fulfilling the WHO 2009 criteria of dengue fever and confirmation with detection of either IgM or NS1 were included. Data regarding symptomatology, clinical course, laboratory values, and outcome were analyzed. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with dengue. Primary malignancy was mainly B-ALL (n=16; 69%). Thirteen patients (56.6%) had criteria fulfilling dengue without warning signs, 5 (21.7%) had dengue with warning signs, and 5 (21.7%) had severe dengue. All patients were treated as inpatients with intravenous fluids and supportive care. Five patients (21.7%) with shock required IVF at 10 mL/kg/h. Two patients (8%) had blood culture positivity and were managed based on the susceptibility pattern. Median delay in chemotherapy was 6 days. The mean duration of hospital stay was 7 days. Three patients (13%) had features of HLH. One patient succumbed to multiorgan failure (with HLH and MDR Klebsiella sepsis)."
31898953,Persistently increased cell-free DNA concentrations only modestly contribute to outcome and host response in sepsis survivors with chronic critical illness.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although early survival from sepsis has improved with timely resuscitation and source control, survivors frequently experience persistent inflammation and develop chronic critical illness. We examined whether increased copy number of endogenous alarmins, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA are associated with the early ""genomic storm"" in blood leukocytes and the development of chronic critical illness in hospitalized patients with surgical sepsis. METHODS: A prospective, observational, cohort study of critically ill septic patients was performed at a United States tertiary health care center. Blood samples were obtained at multiple time points after the onset of sepsis. Droplet Digital polymerase chain reaction (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was performed to quantify RHO (nuclear DNA) and MT-CO2 (mitochondrial DNA) copies in plasma. Leukocyte transcriptomic expression of 63 genes was also measured in whole blood. RESULTS: We enrolled 112 patients with surgical sepsis. Two experienced early death, 69 recovered rapidly, and 41 developed chronic critical illness. Both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA copy number were increased in all sepsis survivors, but early nuclear DNA, and not mitochondrial DNA, copy number was further increased in patients who developed chronic critical illness. Cell-free DNA copy number was associated with in-hospital but not long-term (180-day and 365-day) mortality and were only weakly correlated with leukocyte transcriptomics. CONCLUSION: Increased cell-free DNA copy number persists in survivors of sepsis but is not strongly associated with leukocyte transcriptomics. Nuclear DNA but not mitochondrial DNA copy number is associated with adverse, short-term, clinical trajectories and outcomes."
41402196,"Impact of the francophone pediatric intensive care group bronchiolitis recommendations on diagnostic testing, antibiotic therapy and patient prognosis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is a common viral infection in infants, with severe cases requiring admission to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). While bacterial co-infections are rare, timely diagnosis and management are essential. Updated guidelines from the French-speaking Group of Pediatric Intensive and Emergency Care (GFRUP) aim to standardize the standard of care, reducing unnecessary interventions. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the impact of updated bronchiolitis management guidelines on sepsis incidence, diagnostic test use, and antibiotic prescriptions in a single center. METHODS AND SETTINGS: A retrospective study compared two epidemic periods (2022-2023 and 2023-2024) at the PICU, Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. Clinical and microbiological data, including sepsis incidence, bacterial co-infections, diagnostic tests, and antibiotic use, were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 257 infants admitted for bronchiolitis, sepsis incidence remained low (8% vs. 7%). Implementation of the guidelines led to a significant reduction in additional diagnostic tests (65% vs. 49%, p = 0.013). Antibiotic prescription rates were unchanged, but a narrower spectrum of antibiotics was observed, with decreased amoxicillin/clavulanate use and increased amoxicillin prescriptions. Lung infections were the most frequent bacterial co-infections, with no rise in bacterial infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of updated guidelines reduced unnecessary diagnostic tests and promoted narrower-spectrum antibiotic use without increasing sepsis incidence. These findings highlight the potential of evidence-based guidelines to optimize care, support antibiotic stewardship, and minimize unnecessary interventions in pediatric critical care."
15663552,A case report of the effect of plasma exchange on reactive hemophagocytic syndrome associated with toxic shock syndrome.,2004,"We report here the case of a patient suffering from hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). A 50-year-old man was admitted because of fever, watery diarrhea and shortness of breath. Clinical analysis revealed systemic cyanosis, sunburn-like erythema and septic shock. Staphylococcus aureus was identified from both blood and sputum culture and the serum enterotoxin A antibody test was positive, suggesting that this was a case of TSS. Though the respiratory and hemodynamic status improved by the mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation with catecholamine and antibiotic therapy, the platelet count decreased rapidly. Bone marrow aspiration revealed a large quantity of hemophagocytosis by macrophages. This reactive HPS was treated not with immunosuppressive drugs but with therapeutic plasma exchange in order to prevent worsening of S. aureus infection. After plasma exchange, the circulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) level was reduced and the platelet count increased rapidly. Bacteria associated HPS remains a difficult diagnosis with high mortality and there is a crucial question of whether this should be treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The patient's clinical course would suggest that the therapeutic plasma exchange should be considered as a therapeutic tool for the bacteria associated HPS instead of immunosuppressive drugs."
31833422,Time course of signaling profiles of blood leukocytes in acute pancreatitis and sepsis.,2020,"Activation of intracellular signaling pathways in circulating leukocytes represents an early step in systemic immune-inflammatory response occurring e.g. in acute pancreatitis (AP) and sepsis. Previously, we found aberrations in the phosphorylation of leukocyte signaling proteins in patients with sepsis or AP (measured <48 h from hospital admission) resembling each other and associating with AP severity. Of these patients, those with sepsis or severe AP complicated by persistent organ dysfunction (OD+, n = 17) and patients with moderately severe AP (OD-, n = 6) were followed up in this study by measuring the phosphorylations at two additional time points (2-4 and 5-8 days after the initial sample) using phosphospecific whole blood flow cytometry. Twenty-eighty healthy subjects served as controls (HC). Constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) declined in monocytes and neutrophils of OD-/OD + and in lymphocytes of OD + and remained higher in OD- than HC. Monocytes of OD-/OD + showed low pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in response to IL-6 through follow-up. Monocyte pNF-kappaB levels in response to TNF, LPS and E. coli in OD+, to E. coli in OD-, and lymphocyte pNF-kappaB levels in response to TNF in OD- increased during follow-up but remained lower than in HC, and neutrophil pNF-kappaB levels in response to TNF declined in OD-. Phorbol myristate acetate + Ca(2+) ionophore-stimulated pERK1/2 decreased in neutrophils of OD-/OD+. To conclude, in patients with moderately severe or severe AP or sepsis, improvement and molecular events contributing to OD can be assessed at the level of blood leukocyte signaling."
25791941,In vitro susceptibility of tigecycline against multidrug-resistant gram-negative strains: Etest versus agar dilution.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Tigecycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline with activity against most multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. METHODS: We studied in vitro activity of tigecycline by agar dilution (AD) and Etest methods to evaluate their correlation. The study included 206 isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii recovered from blood cultures of patients of Baskent University between 2008 and 2010. RESULTS: ESBL-producing E. coli had MIC50/MIC90 values of 0.5/0.5 microg/ml by AD and 0.25/0.5 microg/ml by Etest. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae had MIC50/MIC90 values of 1/2 microg/ml by AD and 0.75/2 microg/ml by Etest, whereas MDR A. baumannii had MIC50/MIC90 values of 4/4 microg/ml by AD and 2/4 microg/ml by Etest. The correlation between AD and Etest was weak for ESBL-producing E. coli and strong for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and MDR A. baumannii. Tigecycline MIC values for ESBL-producing E. coli were lower than the tigecycline concentration, while they were higher than the concentrations attainable by treatment doses for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is an appropriate agent in the treatment of E. coli bacteremia, but it is not for treating A. baumannii bacteremia. Tigecycline could be used for K. pneumoniae bacteremia treatment after determining its MIC value. Determining the MIC value by gold-standard methods is more appropriate due to the correlation between Etest and AD at high MIC values."
41436269,Evaluation of the performance and safety of adding the iron chelator MEX-CD1 to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis for removing excess labile iron in intensive care patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury - the Iron in Intensive Care trial (IRON-I.C.): protocol for a phase I-II randomised crossover pilot study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is common in intensive care and is linked to high morbidity and mortality, yet no specific therapy exists beyond supportive care. Excess circulating labile iron contributes to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death via ferroptosis. We hypothesise that targeted removal of labile iron during dialysis may reduce this pathogenic process. This study will evaluate the performance and safety of adding a novel iron chelator named MEX-CD1 (Metal EXtraction - Chitosan DOTAGA 1) to dialysate during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised, open-label, crossover phase I-II pilot study in the intensive care unit of Nimes University Hospital, France. 14 adult patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy will receive two consecutive 24-hour CVVHD sessions: one with standard dialysate and one with dialysate supplemented with MEX-CD1 at 50 mg/L. Each patient serves as their own control. The primary outcome is the iron concentration in the effluent to measure iron removal performance. Secondary outcomes include plasma iron clearance, trace element loss, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and safety outcomes monitored up to 28 days. Statistical analyses will use paired tests and mixed linear regression models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Comite de Protection des Personnes (no. 25.01220.000448) and the French National Agency for Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (no. 2024-A01530-47). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT07236463."
26407413,A Prospective Study on the Predictive Value of Plasma BK Virus-DNA Load for Hemorrhagic Cystitis in Pediatric Patients After Stem Cell Transplantation.,2015,"BACKGROUND: In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), late hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) has been associated with BK virus (BKV) infection. We assessed the value of plasma BKV load in predicting HC. METHODS: Plasma and urine BKV-DNA load were assessed prospectively in 107 pediatric patients. RESULTS: Twenty patients developed grade II and III HC, with 100-day cumulative incidence of 18.8%. At diagnosis of HC, the median load of BKV DNA was 2.3 x 10(3) copies/mL. A plasma BKV-DNA load of 10(3) copies/mL had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 86% with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 39% for HC. A urine BKV-DNA load of >10(7) copies/mL had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 60% with a NPV of 98% and a PPV of 14% for HC. A BKV load of 10(3) copies/mL on plasma was significantly associated with HC in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.1; P = .0006). Patients with HC had a significantly higher risk of mortality than patients who did not have HC (HR, 2.6; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: The above values were used to monitor plasma BKV-DNA load, and they provided a better prediction of patients at risk of HC than urine BKV-DNA load."
31851980,"Microcirculation: Physiology, Pathophysiology, and Clinical Application.",2020,"This paper briefly reviews the physiological components of the microcirculation, focusing on its function in homeostasis and its central function in the realization of oxygen transport to tissue cells. Its pivotal role in the understanding of circulatory compromise in states of shock and renal compromise is discussed. Our introduction of hand-held vital microscopes (HVM) to clinical medicine has revealed the importance of the microcirculation as a central target organ in states of critical illness and inadequate response to therapy. Technical and methodological developments have been made in hardware and in software including our recent introduction and validation of automatic analysis software called MicroTools, which now allows point-of-care use of HVM imaging at the bedside for instant availability of functional microcirculatory parameters needed for microcirculatory targeted resuscitation procedures to be a reality."
41504062,METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Ferroptosis in Sepsis-Associated Acute Lung Injury - A Narrative Review.,2025,"Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) represents a complex and life-threatening condition with limited therapeutic options. Recent research has unveiled the role of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in exacerbating ferroptosis via m6A-insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets. This study delves into the implications, challenges, and prospects of this intricate molecular pathway in sepsis-associated ALI. METTL3-mediated M6A modifications assume a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. These modifications exacerbate ferroptosis, a regulated cell death process characterized by iron-dependent oxidative damage to lipids. The involvement of m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming adds another layer of complexity to this mechanism, offering potential therapeutic avenues. Understanding the intricate network of METTL3-mediated m6A modifications, IGF2BP2, and mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming poses a formidable challenge. Developing interventions that modulate this pathway while minimizing off-target effects remains a significant hurdle. Patient-specific responses and identifying reliable biomarkers further complicate the clinical translation of these findings. The unraveling of this molecular pathway holds promise for personalized medicine approaches in ALI management. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions based on individual patient profiles may significantly enhance clinical outcomes. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including researchers, clinicians, and drug developers, is essential to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and clinical applications."
25653985,Efficacy of Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) Score in Patients with Secondary Peritonitis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in diagnosis, management and critical care of patients with peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation, prognosis remains poor. Early assessment by scoring systems will influence the management and prognosis. AIM: Evaluation of Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) score for predicting the outcome in patients with peritonitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study of 50 patients admitted and operated for peritonitis in JSS Medical College Hospital. The structured scoring system i.e. MPI was applied along with other clinical and biochemical parameters recorded in pre-structured proforma. Data was analysed for predicting mortality and morbidity using EPI info and SPSS software. RESULTS: The overall mortality and morbidity was 14% and 38% respectively. MPI scores of </= 20, 21-29, and >/= 30 had a mortality of 5%, 14%, and 50% respectively. MPI score of 25 had highest sensitivity of 72.09% and specificity of 71.43% in predicting mortality, 80.65% sensitivity and 57.89% specificity for morbidity. MPI score of > 25 were associated with 6.45 times higher risk of mortality (p=0.03), 5.72 times higher risk of morbidity (p=0.005) compared to patients with MPI score </= 25. CONCLUSION: MPI is disease specific, easy scoring system for predicting the mortality in patients with secondary peritonitis. Increasing scores are associated with poorer prognosis, needs intensive management and hence it should be used routinely in clinical practice."
16506546,"Tolerability and efficacy of single dose diethylcarbamazine (DEC) alone or co-administration with Ivermectin in the clearance of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaraemia in Pondicherry, South India.",2004,"The tolerability and efficacy of single dose DEC (12mg/kg body weight) or co-administration of DEC (6mg/kg body weight) with Ivermectin (200 or 400 mcg/kg of body weight) was studied in 60 asymptomatic W. bancrofti microfilariae (Mf) carriers following a double blind randomized design. The drugs were tolerated well. The incidence of adverse reactions of DEC (85.0%), DEC + Ivermectin 200mcg (95.0%) and DEC + Ivermectin 400mcg (100%) did not vary significantly (P>0.05). The mean score of adverse reaction intensity due to DEC + Ivermectin 200mcg (1.41) was significantly higher compared to DEC (0.61) (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between and DEC +Ivermectin 400mcg (0.89) and DEC + Ivermectin 200mcg (1.41) and DEC + Ivermectin 400mcg and DEC. The major adverse reactions were fever, headache and myalgia in all groups. The incidence and intensity of the adverse reactions were maximum between 24 to 48 hours of post therapy. The haematological and biochemical parameters did not vary significantly between pre and 7-day post therapy values in any of the study groups (P>0.05). Efficacy was measured in terms of proportion of cases clearing microfilaraemia completely and reduction in geometric mean parasite density in comparison to pre therapy levels. At the end of one year, DEC with Ivermectin 400mcg group showed significantly higher efficacy in complete clearance of Mf (94.4%) than that of DEC with Ivermectin 200mcg (60.0%) or DEC alone (52.6%) (P<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in reduction of geometric mean Mf density (99.9%, 99.7%, 99.5% respectively). In all the groups, the tolerability and efficacy of the drugs were independent of host age and gender."
19938128,Outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis versus patients with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease.,2009,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming a common cause of liver cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation (LT). Cardiovascular complications related to metabolic syndrome and NASH recurrence in the transplanted liver may affect the outcome of LT in these patients. We compared the outcomes of LT for NASH cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis (ETOH) in a large transplant center. A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent LT for cryptogenic cirrhosis with the NASH phenotype (the NASH group) or ETOH (the ETOH group) at the University of Miami from January 1997 to January 2007. There was no significant difference in survival between the NASH and ETOH groups, despite a trend toward lower survival in the former (P = 0.1699). Sepsis was the leading cause of posttransplant death in both groups, and it was followed by cardiovascular causes in the NASH group (26% versus 7% in the ETOH group, P = 0.21) and malignancies in the ETOH group (29% versus 0% in the NASH group, P = 0.024). Recurrent steatohepatitis (33% versus 0%, P < 0.0001) and acute rejection (41% versus 23%, P < 0.023) were significantly more frequent in the NASH group than in the ETOH group. There was no difference in graft failure between the groups (24% in the NASH group versus 18% in the ETOH group, P = 0.3973). In conclusion, despite a numerical trend favoring the ETOH group, there were no statistically significant differences in posttransplant survival and cardiovascular mortality between the NASH and ETOH groups. Acute rejection and recurrent steatohepatitis were significantly more frequent in the NASH group but did not lead to higher rates of retransplantation."
32056724,Primary cardiac hospitalizations in pulmonary arterial hypertension: Trends and outcomes from 2001 to 2014.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are common and are often for cardiac conditions. Using the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), we examined characteristics and mortality of primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH from 2001 to 2014. METHODS: Adult hospitalizations with any diagnosis code for PAH were identified. Primary cardiac disease was defined as a primary discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, conduction disorder, cardiomyopathy or carditis, heart valve disorder, or cardiac arrest. Temporal trends, characteristics, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2014, there were 207,095 hospitalizations in PAH, of which 100,509 (48.5%) carried a primary cardiac diagnosis. Most primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH were for CHF, and pneumonia was the most common primary non-cardiac diagnosis. Over the study period, primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH fell from 52.9% to 41.4% (p < 0.001). CHF was the most frequent primary cardiac diagnosis associated with death, with sepsis representing the most common primary non-cardiac disease (1,226; 25.0%). Overall, the mortality in primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH was 5.3% (vs. in primary non-cardiac, 6.9%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, a primary cardiac discharge diagnosis remained associated with a decreased risk of death (odds ratio 0.85, p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH are common and are associated with decreased mortality compared to admissions for primary non-cardiac diagnoses."
26798207,Pilot Application of Magnetic Nanoparticle-Based Biosensor for Necrotizing Enterocolitis.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a major source of neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is an ongoing need for a sensitive diagnostic instrument to discriminate NEC from neonatal sepsis. We hypothesized that magnetic nanopartile-based biosensor analysis of gut injury-associated biomarkers would provide such an instrument. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a magnetic multiplexed biosensor platform, allowing the parallel plasma analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMp7), and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Neonatal subjects with sepsis (n=5) or NEC (n=10) were compared to control (n=5) subjects to perform a proof of concept pilot study for the diagnosis of NEC using our ultra-sensitive biosensor platform. RESULTS: Our multiplexed NEC magnetic nanoparticle-based biosensor platform was robust, ultrasensitive (Limit of detection LOD: CRP 0.6 pg/ml; MMp7 20 pg/ml; and EpCAM 20 pg/ml), and displayed no cross-reactivity among analyte reporting regents. To gauge the diagnostic performance, bootstrapping procedure (500 runs) was applied: MMp7 and EpCAM collectively differentiated infants with NEC from control infants with ROC AUC of 0.96, and infants with NEC from those with sepsis with ROC AUC of 1.00. The 3-marker panel comprising of EpCAM, MMp7 and CRP had a corresponding ROC AUC of 0.956 and 0.975, respectively. CONCLUSION: The exploration of the multiplexed nano-biosensor platform shows promise to deliver an ultrasensitive instrument for the diagnosis of NEC in the clinical setting."
41411766,The risks and benefits of disseminated intravascular coagulation-targeted anticoagulant therapy in abdominal sepsis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal sepsis frequently leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), exacerbating organ dysfunction and bleeding complications. Although anticoagulant therapy is a potential treatment for DIC, its use in this context raises concerns about bleeding risks. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate the risks and benefits of DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy in patients with abdominal sepsis. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a dataset from a multicenter nationwide retrospective cohort study (J-Septic DIC registry) in Japan between 2011 and 2013. The study included 987 patients with abdominal sepsis-induced DIC, diagnosed within three days of ICU admission. Patients were divided into DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy (recombinant thrombomodulin or antithrombin) and non-use groups. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounding factors. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day mortality, with bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion as the primary safety outcome. RESULTS: The results indicated that anticoagulant therapy was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio: 0.662, 95 % confidential interval: 0.472-0.929), but a higher risk of bleeding complications (OR: 2.451, 95 % confidential interval:1.372-4.379). Dual combination of anticoagulant therapy did not provide additional survival benefits and increased bleeding risks. The efficacy of DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy correlated with disease severity, while bleeding risk was inversely correlated with severity. CONCLUSION: DIC-targeted anticoagulant therapy in patients with abdominal sepsis was related with improved prognosis but increased bleeding risks. The risk-benefit profile varies with disease severity, suggesting a need for cautious and personalized treatment strategies."
19962482,Comparison of the results of aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =30% versus patients with ejection fraction >30%.,2009,"The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that low-ejection fraction (EF), low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) is a predictor of major morbidity after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 597 consecutive patients with AS (mean age 72 +/- 11 years) who had undergone AVR or combined AVR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 1998 to 2006 (EF < or =30% in 73 [12%]). The outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. The overall hospital mortality rate was 4% (low-EF AS 5%; low-EF AS plus CABG 8%; AS controls 4%; AS plus CABG controls 3%; p = 0.42). Low-EF, low-gradient AS was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality but predicted stroke (odds ratio [OR] 4.3), deep sternal wound infection (OR 10.0), sepsis (OR 6.8), gastrointestinal complications (OR 4.2), and respiratory failure (OR 4.4). The survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 69 +/- 8%, 69 +/- 8%, and 65 +/- 8% in the low-EF, low-gradient, AVR plus CABG group and 95 +/- 4%, 92 +/- 5%, and 82 +/- 7% in the low-EF, low-gradient AVR group compared to 93 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 2%, and 78 +/- 3% in the AVR plus CABG control group and 93 +/- 2%, 89 +/- 2%, and 85 +/- 3% in the AVR control group (p = 0.001), respectively. In the patients with low-EF AS who experienced major postoperative morbidity, the 1-year survival rate was significantly reduced (54 +/- 14%) compared to those who did not (95 +/- 3%, p <0.001). In conclusion, low-EF, low-gradient AS is a predictor of increased major morbidity after AVR, which nonetheless remains the treatment of choice for most patients because of the excellent early and late survival. However, patients with strong risk factors for postoperative renal and respiratory failure might derive less benefit from conventional surgical AVR."
20021698,Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor reflects adrenal function in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis of septic patients: an observational study.,2009,"BACKGROUND: The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulates the inflammatory response during sepsis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which counteracts the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoid (GC), is one of the mediators of the development of inflammation. An inflammatory imbalance involving GC and MIF might be the cause or result of adrenal insufficiency. Our objective was to clarify the relationship between serum MIF and adrenal function in the HPA axis of sepsis patients using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. METHODS: An observational study was performed in a university intensive care unit over a two-year period. Of 64 consecutive sepsis patients, 41 were enrolled. The enrolled patients underwent an ACTH stimulation test within 24 h of the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including serum MIF and cortisol, were measured. RESULTS: Based on their responses to the ACTH stimulation test, the patients were divided into a normal adrenal response (NAR) group (n = 22) and an adrenal insufficiency (AI) group (n = 19). The AI group had significantly more septic shock patients and higher prothrombin time ratios, serum MIF, and baseline cortisol than did the NAR group (P < 0.05). Serum MIF correlated significantly with the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score, prothrombin time ratio, and delta max cortisol, which is maximum increment of serum cortisol concentration after ACTH stimulation test (rs = 0.414, 0.355, and -0.49, respectively, P < 0.05). Serum MIF also correlated significantly with the delta max cortisol/albumin ratio (rs = -0.501, P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified the threshold serum MIF concentration (19.5 ng/mL, P = 0.01) that segregated patients into the NAR and AI groups. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse correlation between serum MIF and delta max cortisol or the delta max cortisol/albumin ratio suggests that high serum MIF reflects an insufficient adrenal response in the HPA axis. Serum MIF could be a valuable clinical marker of adrenal insufficiency in sepsis patients."
20046084,[Comparison of diagnostic utility between procalcitonin and C-reactive protein for the patients with blood culture-positive sepsis].,2009,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a relatively new marker for bacterial infections, and its diagnostic utility has been variable across the studies. We investigated the diagnostic utility of PCT for the patients with blood culture-positive sepsis, and compared it with that of C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS: In 1,270 consecutive blood samples, PCT and CRP were simultaneously measured and results were compared according to the five categories of PCT concentrations (<0.05 ng/mL; 0.05-0.49 ng/mL; 0.5-1.99 ng/mL; 2-9.99 ng/mL; > or = 10 ng/mL). In 506 samples, they were further analyzed according to the result of blood culture. PCT and CRP were measured using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (bioMerieux Co., France) and rate nephelometry (Beckman Coulter Co., USA), respectively. Their diagnostic utilities were compared using ROC curves. RESULTS: The mean concentrations of CRP in five categories of PCT were 15.4 mg/L, 42.1 mg/L, 101.2 mg/L, 125.0 mg/L, 167.1 mg/L, respectively (P<0.0001). Both PCT and CRP showed significant differences between the two positive and negative groups of blood culture (PCT, 8.47 vs 2.44 ng/mL, P=0.0133; CRP, 110.48 vs 59.78 mg/L, P<0.0001). The areas under the ROC curves (95% confidence interval) for PCT and CRP were 0.720 (0.644-0.788) and 0.558 (0.478-0.636), respectively, and showed a significant difference (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic utility of PCT is superior to that of CRP for the patients with blood culture-positive sepsis. PCT seems to be reliable for sepsis diagnosis, and may provide useful information for the critically ill patients."
41462123,High-density lipoprotein 2b combined with sequential organ failure assessment score as a novel prognostic indicator for sepsis patients: a prospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a state of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to consecutive organ failure and lethal outcome. The purpose of this study is to assess the value of the combined use of plasma high-density lipoprotein 2b (HDL2b) level and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in predicting short-term mortality from sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in patients with sepsis and non-septic controls admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) from January 2020 to December 2021. SOFA scores were recorded on the first day after admission. Blood samples were collected from each enrolled patient and the levels of HDL2b were analyzed using microfluidic chip technology. Receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were conducted to determine the values of plasma HDL2b level, SOFA score and the combined HDL2b levels and SOFA score (HDL2b + SOFA) in predicting the prognosis of mortality, respectively. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcome was total in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Compared to non-septic controls, patients with sepsis had lower HDL2b levels (10.95% [8.95, 12.96] vs. 23.78% [14.53, 29.16], p < 0.001). Among sepsis patients, the levels of HDL2b of non-survivors were lower than those of survivors (6.74% [4.63, 8.08] vs. 11.78 [7.20, 13.40], p = 0.002). Moreover, our data also indicated that patients with higher HDL2b + SOFA scores shown higher rates of 28-day and total in-hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC curves for predicting 28-day mortality were 0.755 for HDL2b, 0.782 for SOFA, and 0.806 for HDL2b + SOFA. Multivariate analyses indicated that HDL2b + SOFA (Odd Ratio: 1.321 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.028-1.698), p = 0.029) was potential predictors of 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The HDL2b + SOFA composite score was a reliable predictor of 28-day and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients, showing better discriminatory ability than SOFA alone."
31808857,Evidence-Based Minireview: Longitudinal geriatric assessment in quality care for older patients with hematologic malignancies.,2019,"A 65-year-old women was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; normal cytogenetics, NPM1 mutated, FLT3-ITD wild type). Preinduction screening geriatric assessment (GA) did not reveal any significant deficit, because she was independent of basic activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), had normal cognition, and scored 10 (range 0-12) on the short physical performance battery (SPPB). She underwent standard 7 + 3 induction and achieved a complete remission, although her course was complicated by neutropenic sepsis and bacteremia. She is being evaluated for postremission therapy. Would you recommend a follow-up GA at this time?"
20209724,Septicaemic melioidosis.,2009,Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease in our country. It is an important cause of community-acquired 'sepsis syndrome' particularly in patients with underlying immunosuppression which often goes undetected due to lack of awareness resulting in high fatalities. Here we report a case of septicaemic melioidosis in a diabetic patient.
15689061,Disseminated strongyloidiasis successfully treated with extended duration ivermectin combined with albendazole: a case report of intractable strongyloidiasis.,2004,"We describe a patient with an overlapping syndrome disseminated strongyloidiasis and gram-negative sepsis. She was previously treated with albendazole 400 mg/day 14 days before admission without success. This admission, she was treated with a combination of oral ivermectin (injectable solution form), with a dosage of 200-400 microg/kg/day, and albendazole for 14 days. Strongyloides larvae disappeared from the stool by day 4 and from the sputum by day 10. No side effects were encountered during hospitalization or at the 1-month follow-up visit."
20008905,Low-abundance HIV species and their impact on mutational profiles in patients with virological failure on once-daily abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine and tenofovir.,2010,"BACKGROUND: HIV clonal genotypic analysis (CG) was used to investigate whether a more sensitive analysis method would detect additional low-abundance mutations compared with population genotyping (PG) in antiretroviral-naive patients who experienced virological failure (VF) during treatment with abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine and tenofovir. METHODS: HIV was analysed by PG and CG (771 baseline and 657 VF clones) from subjects with VF (confirmed HIV RNA > or = 400 copies/mL at 24-48 weeks). RESULTS: Fourteen of 123 subjects (11%) met VF criteria; their median baseline HIV RNA was 5.4 log(10) copies/mL, and 4.0 log(10) copies/mL at VF. By baseline PG, 2/14 had HIV-1 with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) or non-NRTI mutations. By baseline CG, 9/14 had HIV-1 with NNRTI and/or NRTI mutations; 7/9 had study drug-associated mutations. By PG at VF, 10/14 had selected for resistance mutations [2, K65R; 1, M184V; and 7, thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) +/- M184V]. By CG at VF, for subjects with TAMs, T215F was more commonly detected (5/14 samples) than T215Y (2/14). For one subject who selected K65R at VF, both K65R-containing clones and TAM-containing clones (both T215A and T215F) were observed independently but not conjunctively in the same clone in a post-VF sample. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects with VF had major and minor mutations detected at VF; CG detected additional low-abundance variants at baseline and VF that could have influenced mutation selection pathways. Both PG and CG data suggest TAMs, not K65R selection, are the preferred resistance route, biased towards 215F selection. No HIV clone contained both K65R and T215F/Y mutations, suggesting in vivo antagonism between the two mutations. The once-daily zidovudine usage and high baseline viraemia may also have contributed to rapid selection of HIV with multiple mutations in VFs."
31993449,Rhodococcus equi Joint Sepsis and Osteomyelitis Is Associated With a Grave Prognosis in Foals.,2019,"The most common pathologic manifestation of Rhodococcus equi, a gram-positive, facultative intracellular bacterium, is pyogranulomatous pneumonia in foals and weanlings. Hematogenous spread of bacteria may subsequently occur, resulting in joint sepsis, osteomyelitis, or subcutaneous abscessation. Medical records from horses presenting to the Cornell University Equine Hospital from 1998 to 2018 were reviewed for cases diagnosed with R. equi joint and/or bone infection, and information about case progression and outcome were analyzed. We hypothesized that, despite advances in diagnostic imaging, antimicrobials and antimicrobial delivery methods, the prognosis for R. equi joint sepsis and osteomyelitis remains grave for athletic activity and poor for survival. The 12 cases that met the review criteria had a mortality rate of 84% (10/12), with one case lost to follow up after discharge and one case discharged with a grave prognosis for athleticism."
41541133,Local soft tissue dissemination of large joint septic arthritis: A report of two cases.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Septic arthritis (SA) is a surgical emergency that can result in joint destruction and systemic sepsis. Local soft tissue dissemination of native joint SA leading to necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare but devastating complication associated with poorer outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two adult patients with poorly controlled diabetes who developed SA complicated by NF-one affecting the knee and posterior leg, the other the shoulder and anterior arm. Both required multiple joint washouts, serial wound debridements, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. One patient sustained extensive soft tissue loss necessitating coverage with a biodegradable temporising matrix (BTM) followed by split-thickness skin grafting. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: These cases highlight the clinical course of this rare but severe complication and emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and timely surgical intervention. We also outline a practical diagnostic and management framework, including antimicrobial selection post-arthrocentesis, the role of pre-operative imaging, and the rationale for selecting arthroscopic versus open joint debridement. CONCLUSION: SA complicated by NF is a life- and limb-threatening condition that presents numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and a multidisciplinary approach incorporating empirical antibiotics, targeted imaging, and prompt surgical management are essential to optimise outcomes."
41537293,Bloodstream infections caused by Bacteroides and Phocaeicola: clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility. Presentation of twenty-four cases.,2025,"Introduction: Anaerobic bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli are rare, but the mortality rate remains high. Increasing resistance complicates treatment strategies. Aim: This study aimed to assess the clinical and microbiological characteristics of BSIs caused by Bacteroides spp. and related genera, and to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains in adult patients hospitalized in a multidisciplinary Polish hospital over a 10-year period. Materials and methods: A retrospective, observational, single-center study included adult patients diagnosed with anaerobic BSIs between 2014 and 2023. Microbiological identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated via gradient diffusion assay and interpreted according to EUCAST. Results: Anaerobic BSIs caused by Bacteroides spp. and Phocaeicola spp. were identified in 24 patients (mean age: 65.6 years). B. fragilis was the most common isolate (62.5%). Mortality among these hospitalized patients was 46%, with a significantly higher risk observed in elderly patients (median age of deceased: 83 years). All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and carbapenems; 25% showed resistance to clindamycin. Discussion: The study confirmed high mortality, significant age-related risk, and variable antimicrobial susceptibility. Notably, Bacteroides-related BSIs often originated from gastrointestinal and urinary sources and were associated with chronic comorbidities, including renal failure. Conclusions: Empirical treatment regimens must consider increasing resistance among anaerobes. Timely microbiological diagnostics, including anaerobic cultures and susceptibility testing, are essential to guide therapy and improve patient outcomes. Significance: This study underscores the necessity for ongoing surveillance of anaerobic BSIs and highlights gaps in empirical treatment practices, advocating for broader clinical awareness and targeted antimicrobial stewardship."
41503117,Perforated Meckel's diverticulum: A rare evolution from diverticulitis to sepsis.,2026,"Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract and affects  approximately 2% of the population. Although usually asymptomatic, MD may lead to complications including diverticulitis, bleeding, obstruction, and-rarely-perforation. Because perforated MD often mimics acute appendicitis, diagnosis before surgery is frequently missed. We describe a 58-year-old man who presented with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and nausea. Ultrasound excluded appendicitis and raised suspicion for MD. Contrast-enhanced CT confirmed an inflamed 3.5-cm MD with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute diverticulitis. The patient initially improved with conservative therapy but returned five days later with worsening pain and fever. A second CT revealed microperforation with peridiverticular extraluminal gas and fluid. Within 48 hours, clinical sepsis developed. A third CT demonstrated frank pneumoperitoneum and diffuse peritoneal free fluid. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed a perforated MD, which was resected, followed by ileostomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Although rare, MD perforation is potentially life-threatening. This case uniquely illustrates the radiologic evolution from diverticulitis to microperforation and ultimately free perforation, documented across three consecutive CT examinations. Awareness of this progression may improve early recognition and timely surgical management of complicated MD."
41439926,Circulating Interleukin-6 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Mortality in Melioidosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Background: Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, remains a major cause of sepsis-related mortality in tropical regions. Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, deaths frequently result from dysregulated host inflammation rather than uncontrolled bacterial replication. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key mediator of systemic inflammation, has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis, but its predictive value in melioidosis has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO CRD420251152797). MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to 15 March 2025. Eligible studies included patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis reporting circulating IL-6 concentrations stratified by survival outcome. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. Heterogeneity and robustness were examined through leave-one-out and sensitivity analyses. Publication bias assessment was not performed due to insufficient study numbers (n = 4). Results: Eight studies were included qualitative systematic review, and four studies comprising 411 patients were eligible for quantitative meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly higher IL-6 levels among non-survivors compared with survivors (SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.02-1.57; I(2) = 86.3%). Leave-one-out diagnostics indicated no single study unduly influenced the pooled effect. Sensitivity analysis excluding the largest dataset reduced heterogeneity to 34.5% and yielded an SMD of 0.51 (95% CI -0.28-1.30), maintaining the same direction of association. Conclusions: Circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in fatal melioidosis and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for mortality. Although interstudy heterogeneity was substantial, the association remained consistent in direction across populations and analytical methods despite the limited number of eligible studies. These findings support further prospective validation of IL-6 in clinical risk stratification and host response-guided management of severe melioidosis, though larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."

The pathogen was initially identified as Kocuria varians by a Vitek 2-based assessment, but its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 100% similarity to K. salsicia. The patient was successfully treated with vancomycin and removal of the catheter."
25500005,Evaluation of the effect of short-term treatment with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (Isentress) on the course of progressive feline leukemia virus infection.,2015,"Cats persistently infected with the gammaretrovirus feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are at risk to die within months to years from FeLV-associated disease, such as immunosuppression, anemia or lymphoma/leukemia. The integrase inhibitor raltegravir has been demonstrated to reduce FeLV replication in vitro. The aim of the present study was to investigate raltegravir in vivo for its safety and efficacy to suppress FeLV replication. The safety was tested in three naive specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats during a 15 weeks treatment period (initially 20mg then 40mg orally b.i.d.). No adverse effects were noted. The efficacy was tested in seven persistently FeLV-infected SPF cats attained from 18 cats experimentally exposed to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. The seven cats were treated during nine weeks (40mg then 80mg b.i.d.). Raltegravir was well tolerated even at the higher dose. A significant decrease in plasma viral RNA loads ( approximately 5x) was found; however, after treatment termination a rebound effect was observed. Only one cat developed anti-FeLV antibodies and viral RNA loads remained decreased after treatment termination. Of note, one of the untreated FeLV-A infected cats developed fatal FeLV-C associated anemia within 5 weeks of FeLV-A infection. Moreover, progressive FeLV infection was associated with significantly lower enFeLV loads prior to infection supporting that FeLV susceptibility may be related to the genetic background of the cat. Overall, our data demonstrate the ability of raltegravir to reduce viral replication also in vivo. However, no complete control of viremia was achieved. Further investigations are needed to find an optimized treatment against FeLV. (250 words)."
41585235,Association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is defined as the admission blood glucose level divided by the estimated average glucose derived from glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Previous studies have demonstrated that higher SHR levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the relationship between SHR and mortality risk specifically in patients with sepsis remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association between SHR and all-cause mortality among adult ICU patients with sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effects model was employed to pool relative risks (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 18.0. RESULTS: A total of 11 retrospective cohort studies comprising 37,790 participants were included. Pooled analyses showed that higher SHR levels were significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.79-2.50; I (2) = 36.3%), short-term mortality (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.77; I (2) = 0%), and long-term mortality (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.40-1.65; I (2) = 10.3%). Subgroup analyses based on follow-up duration (60 days, 90 days, and 1 year) revealed no statistically significant differences in effect size (p = 0.511), suggesting that follow-up duration was not a major source of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis indicated that studies with a higher proportion of diabetic patients showed a stronger association between SHR and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.026). The overall methodological quality of the included studies was high. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated SHR is an independent predictor of in-hospital, short-term, and long-term all-cause mortality among ICU patients with sepsis. SHR, as a simple and valuable prognostic biomarker, may aid in early risk stratification of patients with sepsis.

Although the treatment of sepsis is complex and multimodal, nutrition support plays an important role in the management of these patients. The diagnosis of sepsis, disease category, and severity of illness and the change in sepsis severity and organ function over time affect the delivery of nutrition support.

19946587,Tenecteplase for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a patient treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) for severe sepsis: a case report.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA), an activated protein C, promotes fibrinolysis in patients with severe sepsis. There are no reported cases or studies that address the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction in septic patients treated with DrotAA. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia treated with DrotAA, subsequently developed an ST-elevation myocardial infarction 12 hours after starting DrotAA. DrotAA was stopped and the patient was given tenecteplase thrombolysis resulting in complete resolution of ST-elevation and no adverse bleeding events. DrotAA was restarted to complete the 96-hour course. The sepsis resolved and the patient was discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock complicated by myocardial infarction, it is difficult to determine if the myocardial infarction is an isolated event or caused by the sepsis process. The efficacy and safety of tenecteplase thrombolysis in septic patients treated with DrotAA need further study."
17061487,Serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of group B Streptococcus from pregnant women in Mexico.,2002,"TITLE: Serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of group B Streptococcus isolated from pregnant women in Mexico BACKGROUND: Group B streptococci (SGB) are a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Women colonized might also develop pregnancy-associated infections including urinary tract infection, bacteremia and postpartum endometritis. There are nine different capsular types, and with the possibility of a GBS vaccine in the future; it is essential to understand which of these types are circulating. We determined the serotype distribution of isolated rectovaginal and urine GBS obtained from an obstetric population, and also their antibiotic sensitivity patterns. METHODS: A total of 101 strains were studied: SGB were confirmed by latex agglutination (Slidex Strepto-Kit bioMerieux), and the serotype was confirmed by latex agglutination (Pastorex Streptococcus B. Becton Dickinson, EUA). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. RESULTS: All SGB were serologically typeable; 61.3% were type I, 25.7% were type II and only 12.8 were type III. All of them were 100% susceptible to beta lactam agents. Only 5.9% strains were resistant to erythromycin. CONCLUSION: In the last years, no major changes have been observed in the distribution of serotypes of SGB in Mexico, serotype I is still the most common. This makes us think of the possibility of a vaccine that includes serotypes I and II that represent close to 90% of the isolations."
31836598,Acute Kidney Injury and CKD Associated with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,2020,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for many patients with cancer, as well as patients with some nonmalignant hematologic disorders, such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and certain congenital immune deficiencies. Kidney injury directly associated with stem cell transplantation includes a wide range of structural and functional abnormalities, which may be vascular (hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy), glomerular (albuminuria, nephrotic glomerulopathies), and/or tubulointerstitial. AKI occurs commonly after stem cell transplant, affecting 10%-73% of patients. The cause is often multifactorial and can include sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, marrow infusion syndrome, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, infections, and graft versus host disease. The risk of post-transplant kidney injury varies depending on patient characteristics, type of transplant (allogeneic versus autologous), and choice of chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen (myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative). Importantly, AKI is associated with substantial morbidity, including the need for KRT in approximately 5% of patients and the development of CKD in up to 60% of transplant recipients. AKI has been associated universally with higher all-cause and nonrelapse mortality regardless of transplant type, and studies have consistently shown extremely high (>80%) mortality rates in those patients requiring acute dialysis. Accordingly, prevention, early recognition, and prompt treatment of kidney injury are essential to improving kidney and patient outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and for realizing the full potential of this therapy."
31812084,Postmortem urine concentration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in relation to the cause of death.,2020,"The utility of biochemical marker analysis in forensic autopsy cases is still uncertain due to the postmortem changes which they undergo. Thus, research is required to elucidate alternative samples and biochemical markers which are less affected by postmortem changes. Levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are known to be elevated in congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and sepsis patients. Although NT-proBNP is reportedly excreted into the urine, no study has previously evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of urinary concentrations in a forensic setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of NT-proBNP concentration in urine obtained postmortem in a series of forensic autopsy cases. METHODS: Urinary NT-proBNP was measured in 36 AMI, 10 CHF, and 19 sepsis cases, and in 124 control cases (all with postmortem interval [PMI]<72h). RESULTS: Urinary NT-proBNP was significantly higher in AMI, CHF, and sepsis cases than in control cases. Cut-off values for diagnosing AMI, CHF, and sepsis-related fatalities were 98 (sensitivity, 55.6 %; specificity, 73.4 %), 1050 (sensitivity, 80.0 %; specificity, 94.4 %), and 363pg/mL (sensitivity, 84.2 %; specificity, 85.5 %), respectively. Furthermore, we subdivided the control cases according to the death process as either acute death (87 cases) or prolonged death cases (37 cases). Although urine NT-proBNP of CHF and sepsis cases were significantly higher compared with both cases, the concentration in the AMI cases were significantly high only when compared with the acute death cases. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to elucidate the diagnostic utility of NT-proBNP measurement in urine obtained postmortem in a series of causes of death. This study suggests the diagnostic efficacy for AMI, CHF, and sepsis-related fatality in cases in which the PMI was within 72h."
20038538,Immunization with a combination of three pneumococcal proteins confers additive and broad protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections in Mice.,2010,"Pneumococcal polysaccharide-based vaccines are effective in preventing pneumococcus infection; however, some drawbacks preclude their widespread use in developing and undeveloped countries. Here, we evaluated the protective effects of ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease (ClpP), pneumolysin mutant (DeltaA146 Ply), putative lipoate-protein ligase (Lpl), or combinations thereof against pneumococcal infections in mice. Vaccinated mice were intraperitoneally and/or intranasally challenged with different pneumococcal strains. In intraperitoneal challenge models with pneumococcal strain D39 (serotype 2), the most striking protection was obtained with the combination of the three antigens. Similarly, with the intranasal challenge models, (i) additive clearance of bacteria in lungs was observed for the combination of the three antigens and (ii) a combination vaccine conferred complete protection against intranasal infections of three of the four most common pneumococcal strains (serotypes 14, 19F, and 23F) and 80% protection for pneumococcal strain 6B. Even so, immunity to this combination could confer protection against pneumococcal infection with a mixture of four serotypes. Our results showed that the combination vaccine was as effective as the currently used vaccines (PCV7 and PPV23). These results indicate that system immunization with the combination of pneumococcal antigens could provide an additive and broad protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae in pneumonia and sepsis infection models."
31823850,Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli between community-acquired and post-prostate biopsy acute bacterial prostatitis.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) between community- acquired acute bacterial prostatitis (CA-ABP) and ABP following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (Bx-ABP). METHODS: A total of 4,383 patients underwent prostate biopsy from January 2005 to June 2014. Among these patients, 34 had Bx-ABP; of which 22 patients had E. coli identified in their urine or blood culture. E. coli was also identified in 91 out of 209 patients with CA-ABP in urine or blood culture. We investigated patient and microbiological characteristics. RESULTS: The Bx-ABP (59.1%) group showed a higher bacteremia prevalence than the CA-ABP group (13.2%) (p<0.001). Significant differences in the antibiotic sensitivity to E. coli between the two groups were observed for fluoroquinolone, cephalothin, and gentamicin. The antibiotic sensitivity of fluoroquinolone in the Bx-ABP group was only 27.3%. Amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and piperacillin/ tazobactam showed more than 95% antibiotic sensitivity in both groups. Bx-ABP was an independent predictive factor for bacteremia by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli in Bx-ABP showed a higher incidence of antibiotic resistance and bacteremia than those in CA-ABP. Carbapenem may be a treatment of choice for patients suspected of having sepsis. Considering the recent emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria, piperacillin/tazobactam or amikacin may be considered."
25520834,Classifying types of disseminated intravascular coagulation: clinical and animal models.,2014,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has a common pathogenesis in terms of persistent widespread activation of coagulation in the presence of underlying disease, but the degree of fibrinolytic activation often differs by DIC type. DIC with suppressed fibrinolysis is a DIC type usually seen in sepsis. Coagulation activation is severe, but fibrinolytic activation is mild. DIC with enhanced fibrinolysis is a DIC type usually seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Both coagulation activation and fibrinolytic activation are severe. DIC with balanced fibrinolysis is a DIC type usually seen in solid tumors, with an intermediate pathogenesis between the above two types. In animal DIC models, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced models are similar to suppressed-fibrinolytic-type DIC, whereas tissue factor (TF)-induced models are similar to enhanced fibrinolytic/balanced fibrinolytic DIC. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment may also differ depending on the DIC type."
20007202,Copy-years viremia as a measure of cumulative human immunodeficiency virus viral burden.,2010,"Plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load is a valuable tool for HIV research and clinical care but is often used in a noncumulative manner. The authors developed copy-years viremia as a measure of cumulative plasma HIV-1 viral load exposure among 297 HIV seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (1984-1996). Men were followed from seroconversion to incident acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), death, or the beginning of the combination antiretroviral therapy era (January 1, 1996); the median duration of follow-up was 4.6 years (interquartile range (IQR), 2.7-6.5). The median viral load and level of copy-years viremia over 2,281 semiannual follow-up assessments were 29,628 copies/mL (IQR, 8,547-80,210) and 63,659 copies x years/mL (IQR, 15,935-180,341). A total of 127 men developed AIDS or died, and 170 survived AIDS-free and were censored on January 1, 1996, or lost to follow-up. Rank correlations between copy-years viremia and other measures of viral load were 0.56-0.87. Each log(10) increase in copy-years viremia was associated with a 1.70-fold increased hazard (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 3.07) of AIDS or death, independently of infection duration, age, race, CD4 cell count, set-point, peak viral load, or most recent viral load. Copy-years viremia, a novel measure of cumulative viral burden, may provide prognostic information beyond traditional single measures of viremia."
31898577,[Acute necrotizing fasciitis complicated with multiple organ dysfunction: one case report].,2019,"The treatment of acute necrotizing fasciitis consists of early and aggressive incision and drainage, together with effective antibiotics and active organ support. On January 4th, 2018, a 50-year-old man admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Peking University Third Hospital was diagnosed with acute necrotizing fasciitis in the right lower extremity caused by group A Streptococcal infection complicated with multiple organ dysfunction. The disease progressed rapidly. The lesion rapidly spread from the right calf to the entire right lower limb and was associated with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction within a few hours after admission. The treatment included surgical debridement and amputation of his right lower extremity, multiple antimicrobials combination therapy, gamma globulin-assisted anti-infection, anti-shock, bedside continuous hemofiltration and other comprehensive treatment. The patient was successfully cured. The key to successful treatment of this patient is that when the acute necrotizing fasciitis progresses rapidly, amputation should be done to debride the infected lesions, together with early empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics combination therapy and active organ function support treatment."
41648052,Pediatric severe sepsis: epidemiology and risk factors associated with acute kidney injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric severe sepsis (PSS) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children, incurring substantial social costs. Acute kidney injury (AKI) plays a critical role in determining PSS severity and prognosis. However, existing literature provides limited data regarding the risk factors associated with AKI in pediatric sepsis patients and the impact of AKI on hospital outcomes for these patients. This study aimed to analyze the temporal trends in incidence and outcomes of AKI among hospitalized PSS patients from 2010 to 2019, and identify associated risk factors; and assess the impact of AKI on in-hospital mortality and healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: This study utilized the nationally representative National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database of the United States to conduct a retrospective analysis. All children aged 0 (infants) to 18 years who were diagnosed with severe sepsis between 2010 and 2019 were included. Patients were grouped by AKI status, and in-hospital mortality and medical resource utilization (length of stay and inflation-adjusted costs) were compared. Multivariate regression identified AKI risk factors. RESULTS: The incidence rate of AKI among hospitalized PSS patients increased from 2.7% in 2010 to 8.0% in 2019. However, in-hospital mortality declined from 32.40% to 17.90% over the same period. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in patients with comorbidities. Studies have shown that hospitalizations associated with AKI have a higher likelihood of involving infection sites and a variety of pathogenic flora. CONCLUSION: While the incidence of AKI increased from 2010 to 2019, associated mortality decreased. This likely reflects advancements in critical care that are improving survival, even as more cases are recognized. AKI, affecting 5% of PSS patients, remained a potent marker of severity, was associated with a sevenfold increased risk of mortality and driven by identifiable risk factors like specific comorbidities and infections. Enhanced early identification of at-risk children is crucial to further improve outcomes."
41469172,Endoscopic use of a biodegradable biliary stent in the management of a complex bile duct injury.,2025,"A man in his 50s sustained a Strasberg type D bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was initially misdiagnosed as a minor bile leak. Upon referral, he presented with abdominal pain, sepsis and a large biloma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with plastic stent placement and percutaneous drainage resolved the leak, but a severe stricture of the common hepatic duct persisted. A biodegradable polydioxanone-based biliary stent was subsequently deployed, resulting in complete stricture resolution and improved ductal patency at 6-month follow-up, with no complications. This case illustrates the potential role of biodegradable stents in managing complex biliary injuries."
20042509,Efficacy of multivalent adenovirus-based vaccine against simian immunodeficiency virus challenge.,2010,"The prophylactic efficacies of several multivalent replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vaccines were examined in rhesus macaques using an intrarectal high-dose simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 challenge model. Cohorts of Mamu-A*01(+)/B*17(-) Indian rhesus macaques were immunized with one of several combinations of Ad5 vectors expressing Gag, Pol, Nef, and Env gp140; for comparison, a Mamu-A*01(+) cohort was immunized using the Ad5 vector alone. There was no sign of immunological interference between antigens in the immunized animals. In general, expansion of the antigen breadth resulted in more favorable virological outcomes. In particular, the order of efficacy trended as follows: Gag/Pol/Nef/Env approximately Gag/Pol > Gag approximately Gag/Pol/Nef > Nef. However, the precision in ranking the vaccines based on the study results may be limited by the cohort size, and as such, may warrant additional testing. The implications of these results in light of the recent discouraging results of the phase IIb study of the trivalent Ad5 HIV-1 vaccine are discussed."
31831342,Lactic acidemia due to an infliximab infusion reaction.,2020,"We present the case of a patient who presented to the emergency department complaining of diffuse myalgias, severe jaw pain and chills. She met criteria for severe sepsis and received treatment including analgesia, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and antipyretics. Workup revealed an elevated lactate and leukocytosis however, did not reveal any infectious source. The patient had a history of Crohn's disease and had received an infusion of infliximab ten days prior to the onset of her symptoms. After ruling out other potential causes of lactic acidemia, her final diagnosis was determined to be the rare presentation of an infliximab infusion reaction. On reviewing the literature, we could not find another documented case of a lactic acidemia caused by an infliximab infusion reaction. The key to the treatment of this patient was steroids, antihistamines, and supportive treatment. Emergency physicians do not often encounter infliximab infusion reactions because they occur so infrequently. Along with more common diagnoses such as sepsis, emergency physicians should include infliximab infusion reactions on the differential diagnosis in patients receiving this medication."
19939687,Hepatoprotective effects of gamma-irradiated caraway essential oils in experimental sepsis.,2010,"Irradiation is an important method of processing herbal drugs, while our understanding of the effects of gamma-irradiation on pharmacological properties of seed products such as caraway essential oils is however still very limited. In this study, caraway seeds were irradiated at dose levels of 0, 10 and 25kGy. After extracting the essential oils, the effects of fresh and gamma-irradiated caraway oils (100mg/kg b.w) on preventing septic-related oxidative liver injury induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model were investigated by measuring oxidative stress parameters in the liver. CLP operation caused a marked increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity which was readily reversed in rats treated with fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Likewise, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level in the liver was compensated in rats treated with the fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Moreover, liver GSH which was initially depleted due to CLP was recovered by essential oil treatments. The protective role of oils was further confirmed by showing that liver function tests (ALT/AST) as well as histopathological changes following CLP operation were recovered in rats treated with oils from either fresh or irradiated caraway seeds. These data may suggest that gamma-irradiation to caraway seeds at 10 and 25kGy has no influence on the antioxidative properties of caraway essential oils."
25548383,Formation of infectious dengue virus-antibody immune complex in vivo in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) after passive transfer of anti-dengue virus monoclonal antibodies and infection with dengue virus.,2015,"Infection with a dengue virus (DENV) serotype induces cross-reactive, weakly neutralizing antibodies to different dengue serotypes. It has been postulated that cross-reactive antibodies form a virus-antibody immune complex and enhance DENV infection of Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR)-bearing cells. We determined whether infectious DENV-antibody immune complex is formed in vivo in marmosets after passive transfer of DENV-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and DENV inoculation and whether infectious DENV-antibody immune complex is detectable using FcgammaR-expressing cells. Marmosets showed that DENV-antibody immune complex was exclusively infectious to FcgammaR-expressing cells on days 2, 4, and 7 after passive transfer of each of the mAbs (mAb 4G2 and mAb 6B6C) and DENV inoculation. Although DENV-antibody immune complex was detected, contribution of the passively transferred antibody to overall viremia levels was limited in this study. The results indicate that DENV cross-reactive antibodies form DENV-antibody immune complex in vivo, which is infectious to FcgammaR-bearing cells but not FcgammaR-negative cells."
41415798,Role of Metabolic Syndrome Traits on Infectious Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the causal association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components [systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose (FG), waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG)] with seven infectious diseases (COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19, very severe COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, influenza, intestinal infection, and sepsis) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Causal estimates were primarily obtained using the inverse-variance weighted method, with multiple sensitivity analyses conducted to assess heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. RESULTS: MetS was causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.09), hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.27), very severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.40), and sepsis (OR = 1.50). Among MetS components, WC increased risks of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.10), hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.39), very severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.56), bacterial pneumonia (OR = 1.11), and sepsis (OR = 1.42), while HDL-C reduced risks of intestinal infection (OR = 0.96) and sepsis (OR = 0.92). CONCLUSION: This MR study supports a causal link between MetS traits and several infectious diseases, emphasizing the importance of metabolic management in reducing infection susceptibility."
21048655,Guillain-Barre syndrome following cardiac surgery. Difficult diagnosis in the intensive care unit.,2009,"Weakness of limb and respiratory muscles developing in the course of treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is commonly due to critical illness polyneuropathy, a complication of sepsis, or critical illness myopathy, a complication of the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids. Guillain-Barre syndrome may rarely occur in this setting. We report 2 patients identified in our ICU in the last 20 years. Surgery was an apparent precipitating event in both patients. The clinical, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal fluid features were consistent with this diagnosis. Both patients responded to treatment; the first case was treated with plasmapheresis while the other with intravenous immune globulin. Thus, while rare, it is important to identify this disorder in the ICU because of its response to specific treatment."
41573058,Is the P-wave dispersion a valuable tool in determining the atrial arrhythmia of newborn babies with sepsis?,2025,OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to ensure that newborns receive early diagnosis through P-wave dispersion (PWD) in terms of possible atrial arrhythmias on the provocative basis of sepsis. METHODS: In this prospective study twenty term sepsis and twenty preterm sepsis patients were compared with control groups with their own characteristics in terms of PWD by electrocardiography. RESULTS: The P-wave dispersion value in patients with term sepsis was determined to be statistically significant (p=0.03). There was no difference in PWD between the patient and control groups in preterms (p<0.05). Heart rate in preterm patients with sepsis was found to be statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a tendency for atrial arrhythmias in term newborn infants with sepsis. These babies should be followed by pediatric cardiology with cardiac monitoring throughout their treatment.
15637893,[The role of cholesterol and intermediary metabolites of its synthesis in intensive care and parenteral nutrition].,2000,"Hypocholesterolaemia is a frequent and typical phenomenon of many acute situations such as injury, severe infection associated with sepsis and septic shock, catabolic situations after serious operations, in myocardial infarction and neoplastic diseases. This phenomenon cannot be explained only by malnutrition or energy deficiency although they may participate in the development of hypocholesterolaemia. In the development of the mentioned acute conditions participates according to our opinion also impaired synthesis of cholesterol as well as of intermediary metabolites of its biosynthesis (isoprene, squalene, lanosterol, and lathosterol). Evidence was provided that deprivation of these metabolites is frequent, very marked and statistically significant. Some precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis are extremely important for normal processes in the cell and as mediators (isoprene, farnesyl diphosphate, squalene). Their deficiency is a serious disorder which must be diagnosed in time. It is important to define the patients and conditions where a serious deficiency of these metabolites develops regularly and to seek ways how to treat deprivation of the mentioned metabolites."
25678005,Antibiotic stewardship: reassessment of guidelines for management of neonatal sepsis.,2015,"In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided updated guidelines for prevention of perinatal group B streptococcus disease. In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on the Fetus and Newborn (COFN) provided a clinical report which suggested approaches to infants with risk factors for EOS which would increase empirical antibiotic use beyond the CDC guidelines. This Clinics article reviews the CDC guidelines and 2012 COFN report, summarizes the 2014 commentary provided by COFN members which provided a revised clinical algorithm, and discusses mechanisms which could reduce the number of well-appearing term infants exposed to empirical antibiotics."
41608213,Infection-Related Preterm Birth.,2025,"Preterm birth (PTB), predominantly induced by intraamniotic inflammation, stands as the foremost contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. Fetal inflammatory response syndrome, stemming from the activation of the innate immune system, signifies the occurrence of funisitis or chorionic vasculitis. Maternal-fetal complications associated with infection-related PTB encompass maternal sepsis, fetal demise, neonatal sepsis, neonatal neurological impairment, and chronic lung disease. The inflammatory cascade is initiated when Toll-like receptors present on immune cells within the fetal membranes and the female reproductive tract encounter pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from infectious agents. Subsequently, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells facilitates the transcription of cytokines. The accumulation of neutrophils compromises the tissue integrity of the fetal membranes, leading to membrane rupture via the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Elevated prostaglandin levels prompt uterine contractions and cervical remodeling, resulting in progressive cervical effacement and dilation, ultimately culminating in fetal delivery. The diagnosis of PTB should encompass three pivotal criteria: gestational age, uterine activity, and the consequences of that uterine activity. The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis is established through a combination of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, identification of infectious microorganisms, and placental pathology. Fetal monitoring involves antenatal ultrasonography and non-stress testing. The management of infection-related PTB involves controlling and treating the infection, timing delivery to coincide with optimal fetal lung maturity, and optimizing outcomes for both the mother and neonate. Current preventive strategies for PTB primarily focus on inhibiting myometrial contractions that arise from the inflammatory cascade initiating PTB. An understanding of these pathways serves as the cornerstone for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing PTB."
19940948,First-line boosted protease inhibitor-based regimens in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients--making a good thing better.,2009,"Lopinavir/ritonavir has been the recommended boosted protease inhibitor for treatment-naive individuals in all guidelines since its approval in the year 2000. More recently, the rest of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (namely lopinavir once-daily, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, and darunavir) have demonstrated non-inferior antiviral efficacy at 48 weeks than lopinavir twice-daily. Overall, all ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors display a high genetic and pharmacological barrier to resistance development and protect the rest of the drugs on board in the regimen, achieving similar CD4 count gains among them. During the last year, studies conducted with atazanavir and darunavir have demonstrated superior virologic efficacy against lopinavir at 96 weeks in their pivotal trials. These two protease inhibitors provide significant improvements in triglycerides and gastrointestinal toxicity, together with simpler once-daily formulations, compared to lopinavir. In the case of atazanavir, this is mainly driven by a lower rate of discontinuations due to drug-related side effects, as pure antiviral efficacy is essentially similar to lopinavir. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal intolerance of lopinavir is actually compensated by an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice with atazanavir, but this is more a cosmetic problem and rarely a cause of drug withdrawal. Darunavir has been licensed to be taken once-daily in treatment-naive patients, and shows significantly better lipid and gastrointestinal tolerance than lopinavir. Robust sensitivity analysis with darunavir prove superior antiviral efficacy than lopinavir at 96 weeks also when non-virologic failures (toxicity and discontinuations) are censored, or when only patients receiving lopinavir twice-daily are included in the estimation. Moreover, darunavir has shown superior antiviral efficacy than lopinavir, particularly in three situations of particular clinical concern: high baseline viral load, low baseline CD4 counts, and suboptimal drug adherence. Over the last years, the treatment landscape with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors as initial HIV therapy has accomplished significant advances, with improved degrees of efficacy, tolerability, and convenience, that should be used to guide treatment choice in first-line antiretroviral therapy."
17039106,Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura in a patient with systemic sclerosis.,2001,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been associated with scleroderma renal crises (SRC) in the past. However such reports markedly diminished after the onset of ACE inhibitor use. Recently, reports again have surfaced that describe scleroderma patients presenting with clinical evidence of TTP. We describe a 50-year-old female with longstanding limited cutaneous scleroderma who presented with hematochezia and thrombocytopenia along with other findings suggesting TTP. A colon biopsy revealed thrombi within the lumen. Her course was complicated by renal failure and hypertension that did not respond to ACE inhibitor therapy alone. She improved after a course of plasma exchange. She was discharged home only to return 2 months later with grand mal seizures and hypertension. During her course she developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. She again responded to plasma exchange and she was discharged home. She has remained stable for 2 years. This report emphasizes the importance of fully evaluating patients with longstanding limited cutaneous scleroderma who present with renal failure, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia in association with multiorgan complications. All possible etiologies, including SRC, TTP, vasculitis, and sepsis should be considered. Tissue biopsies (in this case, a colon biopsy revealed thrombi within the vessel lumen) may prove beneficial in assisting with the diagnosis. For such patients who fail treatment with ACE inhibitors, plasma exchange may be considered."
15640641,Effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on functional and histopathologic outcome after traumatic brain injury in mice.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to reduce the risk of sepsis in patients with traumatic brain injury. However, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor exerts potent pro- and anti-inflammatory effects that could influence secondary injury, and outcome, after traumatic brain injury. Our objective was to determine the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on histopathologic, motor, and cognitive outcome after experimental traumatic brain injury in mice. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Research laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. SUBJECTS: Forty-eight adult male C57Bl/6 mice. INTERVENTIONS: Mice (8 wks of age, n = 16/group) were administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or saline subcutaneously twice per day for 7 days after controlled cortical impact or sham injury (n = 16). Absolute neutrophil counts, motor function, Morris water maze performance, and lesion volume were determined after controlled cortical impact or sham injury. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of controlled cortical impact, body weight, brain and body temperature, and systemic absolute neutrophil counts did not differ between groups. Compared with control, systemic absolute neutrophil count was increased more than ten-fold in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-treated mice on posttrauma days 2 and 7 (p < .05, repeated-measures analysis of variance) but did not differ between groups by day 14. There were no differences between groups in tests of motor function or histopathologic outcome. However, compared with control, mice given granulocyte colony-stimulating factor had improved Morris water maze performance after controlled cortical impact (p < .05, repeated-measures analysis of variance) but not sham injury. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a small beneficial effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on functional outcome after traumatic brain injury in adult mice but do not show differences in histopathology or motor outcome between treated and control groups."
31830370,Rapid and Digital Detection of Inflammatory Biomarkers Enabled by a Novel Portable Nanoplasmonic Imager.,2020,"New point-of-care diagnostic devices are urgently needed for rapid and accurate diagnosis, particularly in the management of life-threatening infections and sepsis, where immediate treatment is key. Sepsis is a critical condition caused by systemic response to infection, with chances of survival drastically decreasing every hour. A novel portable biosensor based on nanoparticle-enhanced digital plasmonic imaging is reported for rapid and sensitive detection of two sepsis-related inflammatory biomarkers, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) directly from blood serum. The device achieves outstanding limit of detection of 21.3 pg mL(-1) for PCT and 36 pg mL(-1) for CRP, and dynamic range of at least three orders of magnitude. The portable device is deployed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Spain and tested with a wide range of patient samples with sepsis, noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and healthy subjects. The results are validated against ultimate clinical diagnosis and currently used immunoassays, and show that the device provides accurate and robust performance equivalent to gold-standard laboratory tests. Importantly, the plasmonic imager can enable identification of PCT levels typical of sepsis and SIRS patients in less than 15 min. The compact and low-cost device is a promising solution for assisting rapid and accurate on-site sepsis diagnosis."
20013289,Increased serum adenosine and interleukin 10 levels as new laboratory markers of increased intra-abdominal pressure.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are severe complications of surgical interventions with a high rate of mortality. The technique of IAP measurement is accurate, precise, reproducible and cost-effective. However, laboratory measures for monitoring of IAH have not been defined. We investigated the linkage between the serum levels of adenosine and interleukin 10 (IL-10) with IAP. METHODS: The sera of 25 surgical patients with IAP <12 mmHg and of 45 surgical patients with IAP >12 mmHg were tested. Serum adenosine concentration was measured by HPLC. Serum IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNFalpha, IFNgamma and IL-10 were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CRP was measured by nephelometry. RESULTS: Significant correlations of IAP were found only with serum levels of adenosine and IL-10. In the sera of patients with IAP >12 mmHg, the levels of both adenosine (1.61 versus 0.06 microM, p < 0.01) and IL-10 (63.23 versus 27.27 pg/ml, p < 0.01) were significantly higher than those in patients with IAP <12 mmHg. Moreover, significant correlations were found between individual patient IAP-adenosine values (r = 0.766, p < 0.001), IAP-IL-10 values (r = 0.792, p < 0.001) and adenosine-IL-10 values (r = 0.888, p < 0.001). A direct linear correlation between IAP-adenosine and IAP-10 values was only observed with IAP >15 (Grade II-IV). CONCLUSION: We report associations between IAP and the serum adenosine and IL-10 levels providing new tools for the laboratory monitoring of IAH as well as further understanding of the pathomechanisms contributing to ACS."
31856705,A 2-year-old with a hepatic abscess secondary to an ascending retrocecal appendicitis: case report and review of the literature.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing appendicitis within the pediatric population can be challenging, whether it be a neonate with irritability or a toddler with flank pain. Symptoms may mimic a viral illness, constipation, urinary tract infection, or intussusception, all of which are more common in this age group when compared with appendicitis. While a ruptured appendicitis can result in an intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, and/or shock, the development of a pyogenic hepatic abscess is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 2-year-old male who initially presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and non-specific abdominal pain and was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI). He returned to the ED days later with rigors, worsening abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with a pyogenic hepatic abscess secondary to an ascending retrocecal appendicitis. In our patient, he did not just have a UTI with cultures growing Escherichia coli, but a hepatic abscess that was polymicrobial. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 10 French pigtail catheter was placed. The patient was ultimately discharged on day 8 with continued antibiotics. After his antibiotic course, he underwent an elective laparoscopy appendectomy and is currently doing well post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Our case report illustrates the significance in identifying atypical features of appendicitis, broadening the differential of non-specific abdominal pain in pediatric patients, and depending on the clinical situation, ruling out other potential intra-abdominal infections even in the presence of a true urinary tract infection."
25497635,[Pasteurella multocida septicaemia and pneumonia after chemotherapy in a patient who had no known contact with animals].,2014,"Pasteurella multocida inhabits the upper respiratory tract of many animals. It can cause skin and soft tissue infections in humans, usually in association with animal bites. We present a case of a 66-year-old chemotherapy-induced immunocompromised patient with lung cancer, who was treated for pneumonia and septicaemia due to P. multocida. There was no anamnestic contact with animals, which underlines the fact that immunocompromised patients can suffer from serious systemic infections due to P. multocida - even with no known animal contact."
41473019,Development of a Piezoelectric Immunosensor to Rapidly Measure Prohibitin‑1 as a Prognostic Biomarker for Sepsis and Other Serious Infectious Diseases.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and the leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly when an affected patient develops multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a serious complication defined as progressive and potentially irreversible dysfunction in two or more organ systems. Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that patient outcomes with sepsis would improve if the risk for MODS and mortality could be identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms. We present an approach leveraging quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology for rapid ( approximately 30 min) detection of prohibitin-1 (PHB1), a protein with pleiotropic biological function that dramatically increases in blood during the acute phase of an infection. The feasibility of detection and reproducible quantification of recombinant PHB1 in physiological buffered conditions is described. Sensitivity and detection limit for the third overtone (12.19 Hz mug(-1) mL and 59.06 ng/mL, respectively) were determined to be within the physiological range, highlighting the QCM-D immunosensor's potential for applied use in plasma samples. Importantly, there was strong concordance between PHB1 concentration curves generated using the QCM-D immunosensor and those from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which typically requires 36 h. Our findings illustrate a feasible and reproducible method to detect a bloodborne protein using immunosensor technology that has the potential to improve patient outcomes in sepsis and other serious infectious diseases."
20007618,Central venous saturation: a prognostic tool in cardiac surgery patients.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) is a valuable prognostic marker in sepsis. However, its value in cardiac surgery has not been assessed yet. This study aimed at evaluating ScvO(2) as a tool for predicting short-term organ dysfunction (OD) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort including cardiac surgery patients submitted to a goal-oriented therapy to maintain ScvO(2) above 70% was studied. Postoperative blood samples collected at 30 minutes (T1), 6 hours (T2), and 24 hours (T3) for ScvO(2) measurement were selected to further analysis. Two groups were formed according to the absence (G0) or presence (G1) of OD defined as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score >or=5 on the third postoperative day. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the variables independently associated with OD on the third postoperative day. RESULTS: From the 246 patients included, 54 (22%) developed OD and were defined as G1. The mortality rates in G0 and G1 were 1.6% and 31.5%, respectively (P < .001). In the comparative analysis between G0 and G1, the ScvO(2) values were remarkably lower in G1 at T1 (66.2 +/- 9.2 vs 62.3 +/- 11.6; P = .009), T2 (69.6 +/- 5.9 vs 63.5 +/- 9.4; P <or= .001), and T3 (69.6 +/- 5.6 vs 64.6 +/- 6.4; P <or= .001). The variables independently associated with OD in the final logistic regression model were Cleveland score (95% CI: 1.13-1.44; OR: 1.27; P < .001), lactate at T3 (95% CI:1.21-3.15; OR 1.95; P = .006), BE at T3 (95% CI:0.69-0.93; OR 0.80; P = .005); ScvO(2) at T2 (95% CI:0.86-0.96; OR 0.91; P = .002), and ScvO(2) at T3 (95% CI:0.83-0.95; OR 0.89; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Postoperative ScvO(2) can be a valuable tool to predict OD after major cardiac surgeries. Its kinetics should be carefully followed in that setting."
25528352,Salmonella blood stream infections in a tertiary care setting in Ghana.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Despite the clinical significance of Salmonella infections, surveillance data worldwide remains limited and is more so exemplified by the lack of reports from Africa especially in eastern, central and western Africa. This study reports on Salmonella serotypes as significant causes of blood stream infections (BSI) and multidrug antibiotic resistance at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana. METHODS: Antibiogram patterns, seasonal variations in disease incidence and predisposing factors for infection with Salmonella serotypes were analyzed retrospectively over a 4-year period from January 2010 to December 2013. Blood cultures were processed with BACTEC 9240 blood culture system. Speciation was done with BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter identification system(R), and with slide agglutination using specific antisera. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. RESULTS: We report a 6.5% (n = 181/2768) prevalence of Salmonella bacteraemia at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital; with a preponderance of non-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) over typhoidal salmonella (TS) (n = 115/181, 63.5% versus n = 66/181, 36.5%; P-value <0.002). Children under 5 years bore the brunt of the disease (n = 93/174, 53.4%). Resistance to ciprofloxacin (n = 1/127, 0.7%), amikacin (n = 3/81, 3.7%), and cefotaxime (n = 6/99, 6.1%) remained low, despite high levels of multidrug resistant Salmonella phenotypes (n = 81/181, 44.2%). In multivariate analysis, and among patients with Salmonella BSI, those < 1 year old had reduced risk of non-typhoidal infections [Odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.16-0.92, P-value 0.021]. Similarly, patients with cefuroxime resistant strans were at increased risk of having multidrug resistant Salmonella BSI (OR, 8.97; 95% CI, 3.62-24.15; P-value, 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Salmonellae, predominantly NTS, account for a reasonable low proportion of positive blood cultures in our tertiary care setting; but with significant multidrug resistant phenotypes and low ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime resistance."
31805020,A Machine Learning-Based Triage Tool for Children With Acute Infection in a Low Resource Setting.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: To deploy machine learning tools (random forests) to develop a model that reliably predicts hospital mortality in children with acute infections residing in low- and middle-income countries, using age and other variables collected at hospital admission. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a single-center, prospective, before-and-after feasibility trial. SETTING: Rural district hospital in Rwanda, a low-income country in Sub-Sahara Africa. PATIENTS: Infants and children greater than 28 days and less than 18 years of life hospitalized because of an acute infection. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) capillary refill time, altered mental state collected at hospital admission, as well as survival status at hospital discharge were extracted from the trial database. This information was collected for 1,579 adult and pediatric patients admitted to a regional referral hospital with an acute infection in rural Rwanda. Nine-hundred forty-nine children were included in this analysis. We predicted survival in study subjects using random forests, a machine learning algorithm. Five prediction models, all including age plus two to five other variables, were tested. Three distinct optimization criteria of the algorithm were then compared. The in-hospital mortality was 1.5% (n = 14). All five models could predict in-hospital mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging between 0.69 and 0.8. The model including age, respiratory rate, capillary refill time, altered mental state exhibited the highest predictive value area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.8 (95% CI, 0.78-0.8) with the lowest possible number of variables. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based algorithm could reliably predict hospital mortality in a Sub-Sahara African population of 949 children with an acute infection using easily collected information at admission which includes age, respiratory rate, capillary refill time, and altered mental state. Future studies need to evaluate and strengthen this algorithm in larger pediatric populations, both in high- and low-/middle-income countries."
15608832,A clinical audit of presentation and outcome of Salmonella septicaemia.,2004,"INTRODUCTION: Enteric fever is imported to developed countries while non-typhoidal salmonella infections occur globally. Clinicians and trainees need to recognise the varied presentations of serious salmonella infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical presentations, hospital course, complications and outcomes of 50 patients who were blood culture positive for Salmonella spp seen in 2 years. RESULTS: Nineteen of 24 patients with enteric fever had recently travelled to Asian countries. All the enteric fever patients recovered fully. Out of 26 patients with non-typhoidal salmonellosis, 10 had malignancies, 7 had immune dysfunction states and 3 had aortic aneurysms. Five patients had recurrent episodes of salmonellosis. Eight of these patients who had cancer (4), diabetes mellitus with renal failure (2) and gastric diseases (2) died. Fatal cases were older with multiple admissions and co-morbidities (median, 3) and presentation followed immunosuppressive interventions, often with no fever (4). Onset was sudden with a short and fatally unresponsive course despite effective antimicrobial agents with microbiologic diagnosis made posthumously (4). Death resulted rapidly from overwhelming sepsis and aneurysmal complications. Antibiotic resistance to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol was noted. CONCLUSION: Enteric fever should be considered in travellers returning from Asian countries with fever, and third-generation cephalosporins or quinolones should be used for empiric treatment. Given the presentation of non-typhoidal salmonella septicaemias, clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion and to consider preemptive therapy in patients with prior infection who are likely to develop severe immunosuppression following interventions."
20003357,Effectiveness of combined intermittent preventive treatment for children and timely home treatment for malaria control.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Whiles awaiting for the arrival of an effective and affordable malaria vaccine, there is a need to make use of the available control tools to reduce malaria risk, especially in children under five years and pregnant women. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) has recently been accepted as an important component of the malaria control strategy. This study explored the potential of a strategy of intermittent preventive treatment for children (IPTC) and timely treatment of malaria-related febrile illness in the home in reducing the parasite prevalence and malaria morbidity in young children in a coastal village in Ghana. METHODS: The study combined home-based delivery of IPTC among six to 60 months old and home treatment of suspected febrile malaria illness within 24 hours. All children between six and 60 months of age received intermittent preventive treatment using amodiaquine and artesunate, delivered by community assistants every four months (three times in 12 months). Malaria parasite prevalence surveys were conducted before the first and after the third dose of IPTC. RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was reduced from 25% to 3% (p < 0.00, Mann-Whitney) one year after the inception of the two interventions. At baseline, 13.8% of the children were febrile (axillary temperature greater than or equal to 37.5 degree Celsius) compared to 2.2% at evaluation (post IPTC3 combined with timely home management of fever) (p < 0.00, Mann-Whitney). CONCLUSION: The evaluation result indicates that IPTC given three times in a year combined with timely treatment of febrile malaria illness, impacts significantly on the parasite prevalence. The marked reduction in the parasite prevalence with this strategy points to the potential for reducing malaria-related childhood morbidity and mortality, and this should be explored by control programme managers."
32058993,A Extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas putida bacteremia that was resolved spontaneously.,2019,"Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) is a rare pathogen that causes various infections in newborns, neutropenic and cancer patients, or in patients with risk factors leading to immunosuppresion. Antibiotic resistance in P. putida is seen in growing numbers. Although it is less virulent compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mortal infections are reported. Here, a P. putida case after an invasive procedure in a patient with gastrointestinal malignancy is reported. Although, it caused an antibiotic resistant bacteremia, it resolved spontaneously without any treatment. P. Putida might have lower virulence and a different antibiotic susceptibility when compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in different cases. More clinical information is needed for further evaluation."
31927152,How relevant is the HIV low level viremia and how is its management changing in the era of modern ART? A large cohort analysis.,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is still unclear what might be the best management of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) with low level viremia (LLV) despite being on antiretroviral treatment (ART). OBJECTIVES: Aim of our study is to describe the clinical management of PLWHIV with LLV followed in a large cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: We included 1607 adult patients over a three-year period (2015-2017). Follow up continued until June, 30th 2019 or last available visit. We observed a low incidence of LLV (0.9 % in 2015, 0.7 % in 2016 and 0.4 % in 2017), with a total of 21 patients with persistent LLV (pLLV), i.e. two consecutive HIV-RNA determinations of 50-500 copies/ml after at least 4 months of viral suppression. Among them, 12 had low compliance to treatment. Genotype resistance test (GRT) was performed in 14 patients and demonstrated at least one resistance mutation in 85.7 %. We described three categories of patients with pLLV: i) those whose ART regimen was not adequate based on GRT; ii) those with presumed suboptimal drug exposure, consequence of low adherence and/or drug-drug interactions and iii) those in which pLLV remained unexplained. For the first two categories, optimization or intensification of ART regimen led to viral suppression in >80 % of patients. We observed only 2 (9.5 %) virological failures and 1 (4.8 %) persistence of LLV in patients who did not switch ART. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the rate of LLV showed a decline in most recent years. Adherence and previous GRT should be carefully considered with the aim of further reducing the phenomenon."
25651736,Comparison of the delta neutrophil index with procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in sepsis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of the delta neutrophil index (DNI) with procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) for the prediction of sepsis and its outcome. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients who were tested by blood culture were enrolled. The DNI, procalcitonin, and CRP were measured, the blood was cultured, and other clinical data were obtained by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: The DNI, procalcitonin and CRP increased with increasing disease severity (p < 0.05). The DNI (area under the curve (AUC) 0.932 for sepsis, 0.800 for survival) and procalcitonin (AUC 0.918 for sepsis, 0.831 for survival) had high diagnostic performance for the prediction of sepsis and survival. CRP also has good diagnostic power in predicting sepsis and survival (AUC 0.819 for sepsis, 0.723 for survival). The combination of the DNI and procalcitonin had higher AUC (0.964) than each of the biomakers for the prediction of sepsis. The cutoffs for the DNI, procalcitonin, CRP, and 'procalcitonin + DNI' for the diagnosis of sepsis were 12.3%, > 1.44 ng/mL, > 6.84 mg/L, and > 19.24, respectively. At least one of the DNI or procalcitonin values was high (> cutoff levels) in all sepsis or septic shock patients. CONCLUSIONS: The DNI can be obtained easily from automated hematological analysis and is cost effective. Furthermore, the DNI has a high diagnostic power for predicting sepsis and survival, similar to procalcitonin and better than CRP. The combination of DNI and procalcitonin may improve the ability to predict the severity of sepsis and survival."
41555995,Adrenal Haemorrhage in the Context of Acute Systemic Illness: Three Cases With Diverse Clinical Presentations.,2025,"Adrenal haemorrhage (AH) is uncommon and often underrecognized and may complicate severe systemic stress, infection, or coagulopathy. Prompt diagnosis is essential to exclude adrenal insufficiency and adrenal neoplasms. Three cases of AH occurring in varied clinical settings describe diagnostic approaches, management, and outcomes and draw insights for clinicians. Case 1 is a patient in septic shock hospitalised in the ICU who developed bilateral AH (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). Case 2 is about a patient admitted for chest pain, fall, and suspected infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), later found to have unilateral AH in the context of pulmonary embolism. Case 3 indicates a patient with essential thrombocythaemia and hypertension, presenting with acute abdomen after a flu-like illness, found to have a left adrenal lesion with features of haemorrhage within a lipid-rich adenoma. In all three cases, adrenal insufficiency was assessed; in two cases, steroid therapy was administered, while in one (Case 2), it was not required. Repeat imaging over months showed resolution or stability without malignant transformation. These three cases underscore the heterogeneity of AH presentations, the need for prompt endocrine evaluation, imaging follow-up, and multidisciplinary care. Recognition in atypical settings (e.g., sepsis, respiratory infection, and haematological disease) is key to preventing adrenal crisis and guiding management."
25530683,Pentraxin 3 as a prognostic biomarker in patients with systemic inflammation or infection.,2014,"PURPOSE: The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a key component of the humoral arm of the innate immune system. PTX3 is produced locally in response to proinflammatory stimuli. We reviewed the usefulness of systemic levels of PTX3 in critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and bacteremia, focusing on its diagnostic and prognostic value. METHODS: A PubMed search on PTX3 was conducted. The list of papers was narrowed to original studies of critically ill patients. Eleven papers on original studies of critically ill patients that report on PTX3 in SIRS, sepsis, or bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Systematic levels of PTX3 have little diagnostic value in critically ill patients with SIRS, sepsis, or bacteremia. Systemic levels of PTX3, however, have superior prognostic power over other commonly used biological markers in these patients. Systemic levels of PTX3 correlate positively with markers of organ dysfunction and severity-of-disease classification system scores. Finally, systemic levels of PTX3 remain elevated in the acute phase and decreased on recovery. Notably, the age of the patients and underlying disease affect systemic levels of PTX3. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of PTX3 is low in patients with sepsis. Systemic levels of PTX3 have prognostic value and may add to prognostication of patients with SIRS or sepsis, complementing severity-of-disease classification systems and other biological markers."
41429071,C-reactive protein in adult sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases, without language or time restrictions. Studies involving adults at risk for, suspected of, or diagnosed with sepsis who underwent CRP measurement and reported diagnostic or prognostic accuracy data were eligible. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies were included. Risk of bias was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 tool, and the quality of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: A total of 3599 records were screened, and 22 studies (13,083 patients) met the inclusion criteria, 16 assessing diagnostic accuracy and 6 evaluating prognostic value. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity was 83 % (95 % CI 75 %-89 %) and specificity was 56 % (95 % CI 41 %-69 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 80.1 %) and a false-positive rate of 44.3 % (95 % CI 30.9 %‒58.6 %). In the prognostic analysis for mortality, the pooled sensitivity was 81 % (95 % CI 70 %-89 %) and the specificity was 77 % (95 % CI 64 %-86 %), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 65.9 %) and a false-positive rate of 22.8 % (95 % CI 13.6 %-35.6 %). Most studies presented a moderate to high risk of bias, and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence reveals high diagnostic uncertainty and limited prognostic accuracy of CRP in adults with sepsis. The low specificity and high error rates restrict the clinical utility of CRP for diagnostic or prognostic decision-making in sepsis management."
41556075,Metabolomic profiling of patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2025,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a condition characterized by acute brain dysfunction developed in the absence of a primary infection in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to perform a pilot, untargeted metabolomic profiling of the blood plasma of SAE patients to identify metabolic changes potentially associated with the pathological condition and to generate hypotheses for further studies of its pathogenesis, as well as to the search for promising biomarkers, and the assessment of the severity of the patient's condition. Metabolomic profiling was performed using HPLC-HR-MS, followed by statistical analysis of the obtained data. This blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial revealed significant differences in the metabolic profiles of the study and control groups. Functional analysis showed the metabolic pathways most affected by pathological processes in SAE patients. These included metabolism of acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and taurine, folate biosynthesis, and the drug metabolism involving the cytochrome P450 pathway. In SAE patients with impaired consciousness, including delirium and coma, decreased levels of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines were observed. The metabolomic profiles of SAE patients differed significantly between the groups of deceased and surviving patients: concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids were significantly lower in the group of deceased than in the group of survivors. Our study identified 64 candidate biomarkers that could potentially be used to predict sepsis outcomes. However, further study is needed using an expanded and independent cohort of patients."
32000615,Characterization of low level viraemia in HIV-infected patients receiving boosted protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens.,2019,"To understand the pathogenesis of low level viraemia (LLV) in HIV-infected patients on boosted protease inhibitors (PI/b), we enrolled 34 subjects with a median HIV-RNA 79 copies/mL and followed them for 15 months. Samples for next generation sequencing were collected at three time-points. Two showed resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in the protease gene, while 95-100% had RAMs in the gag gene, which evolved in approximately a quarter of subjects, suggesting a potential clinical role of these kind of mutations."
31893041,Bacterial pathogens and resistance causing community acquired paediatric bloodstream infections in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Despite a high mortality rate in childhood, there is limited evidence on the causes and outcomes of paediatric bloodstream infections from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for ""sepsis"" and ""low-middle-income countries"" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1 month-18 years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]). In Asia, Salmonella typhi (26.2%) was the most commonly isolated pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7.7%) whereas in Africa, S. aureus (17.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%) were predominant followed by Escherichia coli (10.7%). S. aureus was more likely resistant to methicillin in Africa (29.5% vs. 7.9%), whereas E. coli was more frequently resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (31.2% vs. 21.2%), amikacin (29.6% vs. 0%) and ciprofloxacin (36.7% vs. 0%) in Asia. The overall estimate for case-fatality rate among 8 studies was 12.7% [6.6-20.2%]. Underlying conditions, such as malnutrition or HIV infection were assessed as a factor associated with bacteraemia in 4 studies each. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked variation in pathogen distribution and their resistance profiles between Asia and Africa. Very limited data is available on underlying risk factors for bacteraemia, patterns of treatment of multidrug-resistant infections and predictors of adverse outcomes."
15693965,"Pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is a prognostic marker in sepsis, similar to the APACHE II score: an observational study.",2005,"INTRODUCTION: Additional biomarkers in sepsis are needed to tackle the challenges of determining prognosis and optimizing selection of high-risk patients for application of therapy. In the present study, conducted in a cohort of medical intensive care unit patients, our aim was to compare the prognostic value of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels with those of other biomarkers and physiological scores. METHODS: Blood samples obtained in a prospective observational study conducted in 101 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit were analyzed. The prognostic value of pro-ANP levels was compared with that of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and with those of various biomarkers (i.e. C-reactive protein, IL-6 and procalcitonin). Mid-regional pro-ANP was detected in EDTA plasma from all patients using a new sandwich immunoassay. RESULTS: On admission, 53 patients had sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock, and 68 had systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The median pro-ANP value in the survivors was 194 pmol/l (range 20-2000 pmol/l), which was significantly lower than in the nonsurvivors (median 853.0 pmol/l, range 100-2000 pmol/l; P < 0.001). On the day of admission, pro-ANP levels, but not levels of other biomarkers, were significantly higher in non-surviving [corrected] than in surviving [corrected] sepsis patients (P = 0.001). In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the survival of patients with sepsis, the area under the curve (AUC) for pro-ANP was 0.88, which was significantly greater than the AUCs for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, and similar to the AUC for the APACHE II score. CONCLUSION: Pro-ANP appears to be a valuable tool for individual risk assessment in sepsis patients and for stratification of high-risk patients in future intervention trials. Further studies are needed to validate our results."
20003141,Colistimethate sodium therapy for multidrug-resistant isolates in pediatric patients.,2010,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of colistimethate sodium therapy in multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii in neonates and children. METHODS: Pediatric patients hospitalized at the Uludag University Hospital who had nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii, were enrolled in the study. Colistimethate sodium at a dosage of 50-75 x 10(3) U/kg per day was given i.v. divided into three doses. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received 17 courses of colistimethate sodium for the following infections: ventilator-associated pneumonia (n= 14), catheter-related sepsis (n= 1) and skin and soft-tissue infection (n= 2). The mean age of patients was 53.2 + 74.7 months (range, 8 days-15 years) and 60% were male. Mortality was 26.6%. CONCLUSION: Colistimethate sodium appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii in pediatric patients."
31929290,Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury: Etiologies and short-term outcomes in a tertiary hospital in Southwest Nigeria.,2019,"Although the incidence of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (PRAKI) is declining in developing countries, it still remains a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies, short-term outcomes, and their predictors in patients with PRAKI managed in a tertiary health facility in Southwest Nigeria over a four-year period. This was a four-year retrospective review of clinical records of patients managed for PRAKI in University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty-two women with a mean age of 31.09 +/- 7.50 years had PRAKI during the period reviewed. Twenty-four (75%) patients were multiparous and PRAKI was most common in the postpartum period (56.3%). Twenty-three patients (71.9%) were in RIFLE Stage 3, 24 (75%) received blood transfusion, 5 (15.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU) care, 24 (75%) needed dialysis while 19 (59.4%) had hemodialysis. The common causes of PRAKI were obstetric hemorrhage in 16 (50%), sepsis in seven (21.9%), and eclampsia in six (18.8%). Maternal and fetal mortality were 34.4% and 50% respectively. Seventeen (53.1%) had full renal recovery and only one (3.1%) became dialysis dependent. Significant factors that were associated with maternal mortality were admission to ICU (P = 0.01), hypotension (P = 0.02), and impaired consciousness (P <0.001) PRAKI is still relatively common and significantly contributes to maternal and perinatal mortality in Nigeria. Obstetric hemorrhage which is the most common cause of PRAKI is preventable and treatable. There is a need for physicians to effectively prevent and manage obstetric hemorrhage."
16285648,[Vibrio vulnificus sepsis].,2003,"A 59-year-old female patient with a history of malignant lymphoma presented with symptoms of septicaemia. The skin of the extremities showed bullous, necrotizing plaques. Blood culture revealed Vibrio vulnificus as the causative organism. The infection was most likely acquired while swimming in the unusually warm Baltic Sea through inadvertent swallowing of sea water. The disease is rare in Europe. It is discussed in view of its typical clinical and histological picture."
15717720,[Disturbances of protein C activity in abdominal sepsis: diagnostic and predictive importance].,2004,"BACKGROUND: Despite improved diagnostic modalities, potent antibiotics, modern intensive care, and aggressive surgical treatment, more than one third of patients still die of severe secondary peritonitis. Clinical difficulties in the treatment of abdominal sepsis were related to inherent problems of limited clinical signs and the rapid spread of infection. An inflammatory process is often well under way before the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis. The aim of this prospective study was to assess diagnostic and prognostic significance of protein C in abdominal sepsis. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with severe intraabdominal infections with sepsis syndrome were treated surgically as compared to 15 patients with hernia repair (control group). During the study, the following parameters were analyzed daily: protein C, AT III, plasminogen, alfa-2 antiplasmin, HMWK, C5a and C5-B9 complement, C1-inhibitor, CRP. RESULTS. The mean APACHE II score was 17 points, with actual mortality rate of 23%. Each parameter evaluated in the abdominal sepsis group differed from the one evaluated in the control group to a great extent (p = 0.001). The results and multivariate regression statystical analysis confirmed the following parameters as sensitive biological markers of septic cascade (p < 0.0001-0.026): protein C, AT III, HMWK, C1-inhibitor and C5-B9 complement. According to the results the low level of protein C consistently correlated with disease severity and suggested the development of septic shock and poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of plasma proteolytic disturbances was very important, from the diagnostic and predictive point of view, in abdominal sepsis. According to the results protein C was the most significant marker of sepsis and early predictor of the outcome of septic complications during severe intraabdominal infections (r = 0.761; p = 0.0001)."
31946160,Identifying Optimal Features from Heart Rate Variability for Early Detection of Sepsis in Pediatric Intensive Care.,2019,"Sepsis as bacterial infection is the most common and costly causes of mortality in critically ill patients. The early diagnosis of sepsis is significantly important for effective treatment. In this study, over a period of two years, the electrocardiogram of nearly 500 pediatric and neonate patients with heart diseases were collected in 24 hours before diagnosis. The collected data of 22 patients were studied including 11 sepsis patients with positive blood cultures and 11 non-sepsis patients. After extracting the HRV (Heart Rate Variability) signal, 28 linear and nonlinear features according to previous research were extracted. By using the relative entropy method as a feature selection technique, the extracted features were evaluated for their ability to discriminate the data in sepsis and non-sepsis groups, and the best features were entered into the classification process. Using the four classification models of SVM, LDA, KNN and Decision Tree, the accuracy of 86.36% was obtained with Decision Tree for discrimination of sepsis patients from other patients."
20877178,Microcirculatory alterations in the critically ill.,2009,"Disturbed regional oxygenation is believed to contribute to organ dysfunction, organ failure, and death. Recent techniques such as orthogonal polarization spectral/sidestream darkfield imaging and near infrared spectroscopy have provided insight into the microcirculatory alterations present in critically ill patients. Using these techniques, persistent microcirculatory alterations have been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis, notably in patients with septic shock, irrespective of systemic hemodynamic variables. Data on the effects of therapeutic interventions on the microcirculation are also being gathered and may help in developing strategies that can influence regional oxygenation and cellular metabolism, and thereby prevent or reverse organ failure. Whether monitoring the microcirculation can be used to guide therapy remains unclear and requires further study, and this is an exciting field of ongoing research."
32030216,"Associations between changes in oxygenation, dead space and driving pressure induced by the first prone position session and mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Outcome prediction in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is challenging, especially in patients with severe hypoxemia. The aim of the current study was to determine the prognostic capacity of changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2), dead space fraction (V(D)/V(T)) and respiratory system driving pressure (DeltaP(RS)) induced by the first prone position (PP) session in patients with ARDS. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of the conveniently-sized 'Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis' study (MARS). The current analysis included ARDS patients who were placed in the PP. The primary endpoint was the prognostic capacity of the PP-induced changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2), V(D)/V(T), and DeltaP(RS) for 28-day mortality. PaO(2)/FiO(2), V(D)/V(T), and DeltaP(RS) was calculated using variables obtained in the supine position before and after completion of the first PP session. Receiving operator characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed, and sensitivity, specificity positive and negative predictive value were calculated based on the best cutoffs. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included; 28-day mortality was 46%. PP-induced changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2) and V(D)/V(T) were similar between survivors vs. non-survivors [+83 (+24 to +137) vs. +58 (+21 to +113) mmHg, and -0.06 (-0.17 to +0.05) vs. -0.08 (-0.16 to +0.08), respectively]. PP-induced changes in DeltaP(RS) were different between survivors vs. non-survivors [-3 (-7 to 2) vs. 0 (-3 to +3) cmH(2)O; P=0.03]. The area under the ROC of PP-induced changes in DeltaP(RS) for mortality, however, was low [0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50 to 0.75]; PP-induced changes in DeltaP(RS) had a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 56%, and a positive and negative predictive value of 60% and 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2), V(D)/V(T), and DeltaP(RS) induced by the first PP session have poor prognostic capacities for 28-day mortality in ARDS patients."
19958549,Cardiac complication after experimental human malaria infection: a case report.,2009,"A 20 year-old healthy female volunteer participated in a clinical Phase I and IIa safety and efficacy trial with candidate malaria vaccine PfLSA-3-rec adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. Eleven weeks after the third and last immunization she was experimentally infected by bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes. When the thick blood smear became positive, at day 11, she was treated with artemether/lumefantrine according to protocol. On day 16 post-infection i.e. two days after completion of treatment, she woke up with retrosternal chest pain. She was diagnosed as acute coronary syndrome and treated accordingly. She recovered quickly and her follow-up was uneventful. Whether the event was related to the study procedures such as the preceding vaccinations, malaria infection or antimalarial drugs remains elusive. However, the relation in time with the experimental malaria infection and apparent absence of an underlying condition makes the infection the most probable trigger. This is in striking contrast, however, with the millions of malaria cases each year and the fact that such complication has never been reported in the literature. The rare occurrence of cardiac events with any of the preceding study procedures may even support a coincidental finding. Apart from acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis can be considered as a final diagnosis, but the true nature and patho-physiological explanation of the event remain unclear."
15637991,[Congenital dilatation of the common bile duct (congenital choledochal cyst)].,2001,"INTRODUCTION: Choledochal cyst, although a rare disease, is the most frequent malformation of the extrahepatic biliary ducts. The review of the world medical literature gives the overall number of 2500 cases of choledochal cyst. The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 2000000, but it is about four times more frequent in the Yellow race, and 3 times more frequent in females. Congenital choledochal cyst is a disease of paediatric population, as 60% of all patients are younger than 10 years. The basic anomaly of the disease is the embryological arrest of the normal migration of the pancreaticobiliary junction towards the duodenal wall. The result of the disturbance is the extraduodenal location of the pancreaticobiliary junction and the abnormally long common biliopancreatic channel. The flow of bile and pancreatic juice in the duodenal luminary space is insufficient, so the accumulation of bile and pancreatic juice in the common channel and the reflux of this activated mixture towards biliary ducts occur. Choledochal cyst is formed with all its complications: cholangitis, liver abscess, biliary stone formation, biliary cirrhosis, acute and chronic relapsing pancreatitis, and after many years, biliary cancer. Our results in the treatment of this disease are given. We operated on 31 paediatric patients for choledochal cyst over the period 1978-1998. The study is both retrospective and prospective. RESULTS: There were 24 girls and 7 boys, from neonates to teenagers. In 83 percent of patients the complaints started during the first 3 years of life. Unfortunately, only in 22% of patients the complaints were lasting less than 3 months untill the time of operation. The basic complaints were: abdominal pain and jaundice in 95% of patients, vomiting in 74%, high temperature and fever in 56% and palpabile tumour in 48%. About 30% of children had a relapsing cholangitis and 35% of patients an acute or chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Biliary stones were found in 18% of patients. High level of bilirubins was found in 52% of patients, serum transaminase (SGOT and SGPT) in 69%, amylase level was elevated in blood and urine in about half of the patients, and in choledochal cyst in 91%. Ultrasonography was carried out in 78% of patients and has proved to be a very good screening diagnostic tool. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was performed in most of the patients. DISCUSSION: The only treatment of choledochal cyst is surgical. The conservative treatment is reserved only for complications (pancreatitis, cholangitis). The only adequate surgical treatment is the radical treatment, which consists of the resection of the whole anomalous choledochus and definitive separation of bile ducts from the pancreatic duct. This is achieved by the technique of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The paliative method of internal drainage of choledochal cyst consists of cystoduodeno or cystojejunostomy, but is now abandoned, as the disease continues with all its manifestations and complications. The internal drainage was performed in 6 our patients, but one of them died (a neonate with sepsis at admitance). Three patients were excluded from the study, and 2 girls were later radically reoperated on. In all other 25 patients resection of the whole choledohus and Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy were carried out. There were neither operative, nor postoperative deaths. Except the temporary bile leaking, spontaneously healed, there were no significant intraoperative complications. All patients were regularly followed-up, they had no complaints, and all their laboratory and ultrasonographic findings were normal. CONCLUSION: Congenital dilatation of biliary ducts is a rare disease, but it must be considered in differential diagnosis of unclear upper abdominal pains, jaundice and pancreatitis in children. In the diagnosis of this disease the ultrasound imaging is of utmost importance as a screening method, and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography as a method of complete visualization. Resection of the diseased common bile duct and Roux-Y hepatico-jejunostomy are the method of choice in the treatment of children with choledochal cyst."
19948838,Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to complement-mediated immunity is dependent on the capsular serotype.,2010,"Streptococcus pneumoniae strains vary considerably in the ability to cause invasive disease in humans, and this is partially associated with the capsular serotype. The S. pneumoniae capsule inhibits complement- and phagocyte-mediated immunity, and differences between serotypes in these effects on host immunity may cause some of the variation in virulence between strains. However, the considerable genetic differences between S. pneumoniae strains independent of the capsular serotype prevent an unambiguous assessment of the effects of the capsular serotype on immunity using clinical isolates. We have therefore used capsular serotype-switched TIGR4 mutant strains to investigate the effects of the capsular serotype on S. pneumoniae interactions with complement. Flow cytometry assays demonstrated large differences in C3b/iC3b deposition on opaque-phase variants of TIGR4(-)+4, +6A, +7F, and +23F strains even though the thicknesses of the capsule layers were similar. There was increased C3b/iC3b deposition on TIGR4(-)+6A and +23F strains compared to +7F and +4 strains, and these differences persisted even in serum depleted of immunoglobulin G. Neutrophil phagocytosis of the TIGR4(-)+6A and +23F strains was also increased, but only in the presence of complement, showing that the effects of the capsular serotype on C3b/iC3b deposition are functionally significant. In addition, the virulence of the TIGR4(-)+6A and +23F strains was reduced in a mouse model of sepsis. These data demonstrate that resistance to complement-mediated immunity can vary with the capsular serotype independently of antibody and of other genetic differences between strains. This might be one mechanism by which the capsular serotype can affect the relative invasiveness of different S. pneumoniae strains."
20007386,Carriage of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a cohort of infants in southern Israel: risk factors and molecular features.,2010,"There are few data about the epidemiology of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) among children in Israel. This study was intended to identify risk factors for CA-MRSA colonization in healthy infants, to characterize the molecular features of colonizing organisms, and to determine whether they are responsible for health care-associated (HA) infections. Nasal cultures and demographic details were collected from a cohort of healthy infants at 5 visits between the ages of 2 and 12 months. Clinical characteristics of pediatric MRSA bloodstream infections (2001 to 2006) and wound cultures collected over 6 months were also studied. Clonal structure was evaluated by multilocus sequence typing. Isolates were studied for the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type and for the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. MRSA was cultured at least once from 45 of 659 infants (346 Jewish and 313 Bedouin infants). Forty of 45 (89%) isolates were from Bedouin infants. Twenty-nine of 45 (64.4%) belonged to a new clonal complex, designated CC913, that carries SCCmec IV but not the PVL genes. CC913 was also isolated from 9/14 blood cultures and 7/8 wounds. All CC913 infections occurred in Bedouin children, and all but two were HA. In conclusion, Bedouin origin was the main risk factor for carriage of CA-MRSA. CC913 was dominant both in healthy carriers and as a cause of pediatric HA-MRSA bloodstream infections."
20003112,Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection: difficulties in diagnosis and treatment.,2010,"Immunocompromised patients who are infected with Strongyloides stercoralis may develop a potentially fatal auto-infection syndrome characterised by non-specific pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms and Gram negative sepsis. We present the case of one such patient who underwent a negative laparotomy for a presumed intra-abdominal surgical catastrophe with a subsequent protracted stay on the intensive care unit. Once the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis was made, the patient was successfully treated with subcutaneous antihelminthic drugs. With appropriate screening for and eradication of strongyloides in those with immune compromise, or in those about to start immunosuppressive therapy, potentially fatal episodes of hyperinfection could be avoided. In the absence of screening, severe strongyloidiasis should be suspected in immunosuppressed individuals who have travelled to or resided in an endemic area and present with the characteristic features. Awareness of the signs of hyperinfection amongst those involved in acute care could prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality in these patients."
25535674,Chemoradiotherapy in elderly patients with advanced head and neck cancer under intensive nutritional support.,2015,"AIM: To evaluate treatment tolerance, toxicities and survival in elderly patients with advanced head and neck cancer who received inpatient-based intensive nutritional support with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in comparison with younger patients undergoing the same treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 126 stage III, IVA and IVB head and neck cancer patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between 2007 and 2009 under an inpatient-based nutritional support program. The clinical characteristics, treatment tolerance, toxicities and survival of patients older than 65 years were compared with those of identically treated patients younger than 65 years. RESULTS: There were 21 patients older than 65 years and 105 patients younger than 65 years. Clinical characteristics and treatment toxicities were similar between the groups, except that the elderly were less likely to tolerate cisplatin, experienced more weight loss, required more feeding tube support and tended to have >grade 3 hematological toxicities and to develop sepsis during the period of chemoradiotherapy. The 1- and 2-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival rates were nearly identical. CONCLUSION: Age alone should not be considered a contraindication to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer. Older patients require more careful multidisciplinary assessment of their supportive care needs to ensure successful completion of treatment and avoid further treatment-related toxicity."
31857507,[Expression level of glial fibrillary acidic protein and its clinical significance in patients with  sepsis-associated encephalopathy].,2019,"To determine expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein in patients of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) and its clinical significance.  Methods: Patients, admitted to intensive care units and diagnosed as sepsis, were recruited to our study from October 2016 to August 2018 in the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. SAE is defined as a brain dysfunction secondary to sepsis and without evidence of a primary central nervous system infection or encephalopathy due to other reasons. The SAE group and non-SAE group were classed by Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) score. We measured the levels of serum GFAP, S100beta and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) within 24 hours after diagnosis of sepsis, and compared the patients' general clinical data, ICU stay time, 28-day and 180-day mortality.  Results: Among 152 enrolled patients, 58 and 94 were assigned to the SAE group and the non-SAE group, respectively. There were a significantly higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, 28-day mortality rate, as well as 180-day mortality rate in the SAE group (all P<0.001). The levels of GFAP, NSE and S100beta in the SAE group were significantly higher than those in the non-SAE group (all P<0.001). The diagnostic values of GFAP was 0.67 mug/L, with sensitivity at 75.9% and specificity at 77.7%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of GFAP, NSE and S100beta were 0.803, 0.795 and 0.750, respectively. Pearson analysis showed that serum GFAP level was positively correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, but it was negatively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 28-day survival rate and 180-day survival rate.  Conclusion: The level of serum GFAP is significantly increased in SAE, which shows certain correlation with incidence, severity and prognosis of the disease."
41497125,Higher admission IL-6 levels are associated with higher platelet levels at discharge in sepsis patients.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome, with an overall mortality rate of 32.8%. Platelets have been shown to have a central role in the pathogenesis of a diverse array of immune-mediated and infectious diseases, and both thrombocytopenia and platelet hyperreactivity independently correlate with elevated sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: From February 2021 to June 2022, patients diagnosed with sepsis (according to the Sepsis 3.0 criteria) from the emergency department were screened and enrolled in a prospective observational cytokine analysis cohort. ""Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Grp I Panel 17-plex"" was used for cytokines analysis. Patients were stratified into high- and low-platelet groups using a discharge platelet threshold of 150 x 10(9)/L. Data were analyzed with R 4.4.0 and GraphPad Prism 9, calculating medians and frequencies for variables. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled and were classified into high- and low-platelet groups (31 vs 26). IL-6 had a significant difference between the two groups after adjusting for admission platelet level and length of stay in hospital (2072 vs 107.1, q < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve also showed IL-6 had high degrees of sensitivity and specificity for predicting higher platelet levels. CONCLUSION: Higher IL-6 levels at admission for sepsis were associated with higher platelet levels at discharge."

However, the development of infections following fingersticks is a potential complication of blood glucose monitoring that has been reported in the literature. We describe a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia introduced during a routine fingerstick for blood glucose monitoring in a febrile neutropenic patient."
41477926,Subsequent risk of death from sepsis among over 6 million cancer patients: A population-based cohort study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer patients, particularly due to the immunosuppressive effects of both malignancy and its treatments. This study aims to assess the risk of sepsis-related mortality in cancer patients, identify the effects of various cancer types and demographic factors, and provide insights for developing targeted preventive strategies. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which includes approximately 26.5 % of the U.S. POPULATION: The analysis covered 6,891,191 cancer patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2021. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated to compare sepsis-related mortality risk in cancer patients with the general population. Key variables included cancer type, age, gender, race, and marital status. RESULTS: Of the 6,891,191 cancer patients included, 25,232 (0.37 %) died from sepsis. The overall SMR was 1.52 (95 % CI: 1.50-1.54), with an AER of 2.15 (95 % CI: 2.05-2.25) per 10,000 person-years. Patients with brain and other nervous system cancers (SMR = 5.74, 95 % CI: 4.95-6.61), respiratory system cancers (SMR = 3.52, 95 % CI: 3.38-3.66), and hematologic malignancies such as myeloma (SMR = 3.25, 95 % CI: 2.97-3.55) exhibited high sepsis-related mortality risks. Disparities were observed, with elevated risks in female patients (SMR = 1.64, 95 % CI: 1.61-1.67), American Indian/Alaska Native patients (SMR = 4.23, 95 % CI: 3.50-5.07), and single (never married) individuals (SMR = 2.50, 95 % CI: 2.42-2.58). Mortality risk was most pronounced within the first two months following cancer diagnosis, with an SMR of 7.37 (95 % CI: 7.14-7.61). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a significantly increased risk of sepsis-related mortality among cancer patients, highlighting the need for improved infection prevention, early interventions, and tailored strategies. Multidisciplinary care and enhanced support for high-risk groups are essential to mitigate sepsis-related complications and improve outcomes."
15774074,Bench-to-bedside review: Resuscitation in the emergency department.,2005,"Over the past decade the practice of acute resuscitation and its monitoring have undergone significant changes. Utilization of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, goal-directed therapy, restricted fluid volume, blood transfusion and minimally invasive technology for monitoring tissue oxygenation have changed the practice of acute resuscitation. Early diagnosis and definitive treatment of the underlying cause of shock remains the mainstay for survival after successful resuscitation. Patient-centered outcome end-points, in addition to survival, are being utilized to appraise the effectiveness of treatment. Application of medical ethics to the ever changing practice of acute resuscitation has also become a societal expectation."
15822467,[Isolated acute renal failure is not associated to an increase in mortality of patients in intensive care units].,2004,"This study assess the prognostic factors increasing mortality of patients with acute renal failure in intensive care units. The study included 923 patients admitted to the intensive care unit over a period of two years. Acute renal failure was defined by the following criteria, a blood urea concentration of more than 30 mmol/l, a serum creatinine concentration of more than 180 micromol/l or creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min. Patients were divided into two groups survivors (V) and dead patients (D). 95 patients presented acute renal failure with a mortality rate of 57.9%. There was no difference between the two groups. There was no difference between the two groups. Patients in intensive care units with only acute renal failure doesn't have a worse prognosis, but the association to two or more other organ dysfunction's, mechanical ventilation of more that 12 days, sepsis or Glasgow coma scale less than 8 are predictive of mortality."
41625897,Comparative Evaluation of Platelet Indices in Clinical and Culture-Positive Neonatal Sepsis: A Prospective Observational Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is among the significant causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Blood culture, the diagnostic gold standard, is limited by delayed results and low sensitivity. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) may offer early, accessible biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of platelet indices, i.e., MPV and PDW, in clinical and culture-positive neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 170 neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the NICU at MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Participants were categorized into clinical (n = 88) and culture-positive (n = 82) sepsis groups. Platelet parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 170 neonates enrolled, 82 (48.2%) had culture-positive sepsis, while 88 (51.8%) were categorized as clinical sepsis. MPV and PDW were significantly higher in both the culture-positive group and the clinical sepsis group. CONCLUSION: MPV and PDW are significantly elevated in both the culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis and the clinical sepsis group. Platelet indices may serve as supportive diagnostic markers in resource-limited settings. Their integration with clinical and laboratory findings could enhance early diagnosis."
31808551,Corticosteroids for treating sepsis in children and adults.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failure. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Thus, providing corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and 2015 prior to this update. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death in children and adults with sepsis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and the WHO Clinical Trials Search Portal, on 25 July 2019. In addition, we conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors, to identify additional studies as needed. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care (antimicrobials, fluid replacement, and vasopressor therapy as needed) in children and adults with sepsis. We also included RCTs of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus of corticosteroids. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data, which was checked by the others, and by the lead author of the primary study when possible. We obtained unpublished data from the authors of some trials. We assessed the methodological quality of trials and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Review authors did not contribute to assessment of eligibility and risk of bias, nor to data extraction, for trials they had participated in. MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 trials (12,192 participants), of which six included only children, two included children and adults, and the remaining trials included only adults. Nine studies are ongoing and will be considered in future versions of this review. We judged 19 trials as being at low risk of bias. Corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care Compared to placebo or usual care, corticosteroids probably slightly reduce 28-day mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.99; 11,233 participants; 50 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in long-term mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 6236 participants; 7 studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably slightly reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 8183 participants; 26 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay for all participants (mean difference (MD) -1.07 days, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.19; 7612 participants; 21 studies; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in a large reduction in length of hospital stay for all participants (MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.93 to -0.33; 8795 participants; 22 studies; high-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44; 6145 participants; 6 studies; high-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably do not increase the risk of superinfection (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19; 5356 participants; 25 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of hypernatraemia (high-certainty evidence) and probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia (moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that there is probably little or no difference in gastroduodenal bleeding, stroke, or cardiac events, and low-certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in neuropsychiatric events. Continuous infusion of corticosteroids versus intermittent bolus We are uncertain about the effects of continuous infusion of corticosteroids compared with intermittent bolus administration. Three studies reported data for this comparison, and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids probably reduce 28-day and hospital mortality among patients with sepsis. Corticosteroids result in large reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of major complications; however, corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness and hypernatraemia, and probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. The effects of continuous versus intermittent bolus administration of corticosteroids are uncertain."
15640632,Hospital mortality and resource use in subgroups of the Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) trial.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in hospital mortality and resource use in adult severe sepsis subjects randomized to receive drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) or placebo in the PROWESS trial. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, blinded follow-up of subjects enrolled in a previous randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: One hundred sixty-four tertiary care institutions in 11 countries. PARTICIPANTS: The 1,690 subjects with severe sepsis enrolled and treated with study drug in PROWESS, of whom 1,220 were alive at 28 days (the end of the original PROWESS follow-up). INTERVENTIONS: DrotAA (n = 850), 24 microg/kg/hr for 96 hrs, or placebo (n = 840). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: New follow-up data through hospital discharge were merged with existing 28-day follow-up data. Hospital mortality was calculated for designated subgroups. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay and Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 (TISS-28) scores were calculated overall and in designated subgroups. Hospital discharge location was recorded. The 95% confidence interval of most subgroups contained the relative risk estimate for overall 28-day and hospital mortality. Median hospital length of stay and intensive care unit length of stay were similar in both treatment groups: 16 vs. 17 days (p = .22) and 9 vs. 9 days (p = .7) for placebo vs. DrotAA. No significant difference in TISS-28 scores was observed between treatment groups overall or in subgroups of disease severity. In subjects for whom discharge destination was reported, 42.8% of placebo subjects and 46.8% of DrotAA subjects (two thirds of survivors in each group) were discharged directly to home. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in hospital mortality with DrotAA in most of the subgroups of PROWESS is consistent with the reduction in 28-day and hospital mortality observed in the overall PROWESS population. Additional survivors created with DrotAA treatment did not increase per-patient resource use or intensive care unit or hospital length of stay."
32440076,Green Pigmentation of Teeth Caused by Neonatal Cholestatic Jaundice and Sepsis: A Case Report.,2019,"AIM: The aim of this article is to report a case of green discoloration of primary teeth associated with neonatal cholestatic jaundice and sepsis in a 2-year-old girl. BACKGROUND: Systemic changes can lead to dental alterations of the teeth. One of the disorders is elevated serum bilirubin levels that can cause pigmentation of teeth. Green pigmentation of teeth is uncommon, but when it occurs, is a cause of concern for parents and the child, as he may also loose self-confidence. CASE DESCRIPTION: The parents reported to the clinic with the child whose chief complaint was green pigmented teeth. Her medical records revealed she was preterm and was diagnosed with neonatal cholestatic jaundice which lead to hyperbilirubinemia and sepsis. On review at 36 months of age, all her deciduous teeth were completely erupted and a striking demarcation was visible between the green incisal edges and the normally colored cervical one-thirds of all primary teeth. Treatment alternatives were suggested and the child was kept on regular follow-ups. CONCLUSION: So, one should be aware of such condition and seek medical practitioner or reports to confirm the diagnosis. If such a condition exists, esthetic treatment can be achieved with the newer techniques in cosmetic dentistry. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Green pigmentation has very limited causes. The time of illness coincides with the stage of tooth formation. Proper medical history is important to evaluate the extent of pigmentation and probable involvement of the permanent teeth.

31933698,Giant cell myocarditis with central diabetes insipidus: A case report.,2020,"A 51-year-old male, previously diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus due to lymphocytic hypophysitis, presented with fever and dyspnea for 1 week. On arrival, he exhibited hypotension (85/60 mmHg) and sinus tachycardia (110 bpm). His electrocardiogram revealed mild ST elevation on V2-V4. Echocardiography indicated a near-normal (50%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), although the inferior wall of the left ventricle exhibited severe hypokinesis. Fulminant myocarditis and circulatory insufficiency were suspected, and treatment with dobutamine, 3 mug/kg/min, was started. His LVEF gradually decreased to 20%. On day 17, he developed cardiogenic shock due to ventricular tachycardia and underwent peripheral venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-aortic balloon pumping. Although he did not exhibit polyuria, intravenous vasopressin infusion (0.5 U/h) was performed to maintain normonatremia. Endomyocardial biopsy results revealed the infiltration of scattered giant cells (GCs) and extensive lymphocytes. Despite immunosuppressive therapy (methylprednisolone and cyclosporine), his cardiac function did not recover. On day 36, he received a biventricular assist device; however, he died on day 47 due to the progression of sepsis and multiple organ failure. We speculate that a deficient expression of programmed cell death protein-1 was the cause of both GC myocarditis and lymphocytic hypophysitis. <Learning objective: We describe a fatal case of fulminant giant cell myocarditis complicated by central diabetes insipidus due to lymphocytic hypophysitis. Normonatremia was maintained with intravenous vasopressin 0.5 U/h, and circulatory status was maintained with mechanical circulatory support. We speculate that T-cell programmed cell death protein 1 dysregulation was the common cause of the two disorders.>."
41432632,Histone H3 may be More Closely Associated with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation and Multiple Organ Failure Than HMGB1.,2025,"BackgroundAmong damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the specific contributions of histone and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between two DAMP markers, plasma histone H3 and HMGB1 levels, and concurrent DIC and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in critically ill patients.MethodsPlasma levels of histone H3 and HMGB1 were prospectively quantified in 46 critically ill patients who demonstrated systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possible sepsis, and required intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. We analyzed two DAMP marker values, various plasma-inflammatory and non-inflammatory cytokine levels, acute DIC on ICU day 3, and the maximum SOFA score at 48 h after ICU admission.ResultsOn ICU day 3, 25 patients had DIC while 21 did not. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma histone H3 levels (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.17 [1.02- 1.49], p = 0.008) and TNF-alpha (1.006 [1.001- 1.014], p = 0.007) were significant independent factors of DIC pathogenesis. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for the maximum SOFA score were 0.664, 0.602, 0.348, and 0.221 for IL-8, IL-6, histone H3, and HMGB1, respectively.ConclusionIn the early phase requiring intensive care, histone H3 levels exhibited a more positive association with the onset of DIC than HMGB1. Conversely, inflammatory cytokines may exert a more substantial influence on the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure in comparison to DAMPs."
25620337,Management of a subclavian artery thrombosis causing acute anterior wall infarction and concurrent left arm ischemia in a patient with prior coronary bypass.,2014,"We report a 57-year-old patient with acute anterior wall infarction with a history of a coronary baypass graft operation in 2007. He also had concurrent left arm cyanosis and severe pain. He had received diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma one month previously and had had his first chemotherapy in the previous week with gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. After the angiography, a giant thrombus was detected in the proximal left subclavian artery, deteriorating the flows of both left internal mammarian artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery graft, as well as the left brachial artery. The proximal subclavian artery was stented and good flow was achieved. Through the LIMA, the distal part of LAD, which was totally obstructed with probable distal thrombus embolization, was reached and a percutaneous balloon angioplasty performed. However, the no-reflow phenomenon was observed in distal LAD. A Fogarty traction of thrombus was performed successfully for the revascularization of the left arm. Approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, both angina and ST segment elevation in ECG were resolved under unfractioned heparin and nitroglycerin infusion. However, the patient died due to sepsis seven days after admission to hospital. In the literature, there are only a few previous reports on this rare clinical entity. The eitology, presentation, and the possible management strategies of this clinical entity is presented in this report."
25538418,Use of a novel hemoadsorption device for cytokine removal as adjuvant therapy in a patient with septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction: A case study.,2014,"CytoSorb((R)) (CytoSorbents Corporation, USA) is a novel sorbent hemoadsorption device for cytokine removal. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical use of CytoSorb((R)) in the management of patient with septic shock. We used this device as an adjuvant to stabilize a young patient with multi-organ failure and severe sepsis with septic shock. A 36-year-old female patient was hospitalized with the complaints of malaise, general body ache, and breathing difficulty and had a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism and morbid obesity. She was diagnosed to have septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction (MODS) and a low perfusion state. CytoSorb((R)) hemoadsorption column was used as an attempt at blood purification. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score, MODS score, and sequential organ failure assessment score were measured before and after the device application. CytoSorb application as an adjuvant therapy could be considered in septic shock."
20400112,Nitric oxide and redox regulation in the liver: part II. Redox biology in pathologic hepatocytes and implications for intervention.,2011,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are created in normal hepatocytes and are critical for normal physiologic processes, including oxidative respiration, growth, regeneration, apoptosis, and microsomal defense. When the levels of oxidation products exceed the capacity of normal antioxidant systems, oxidative stress occurs. This type of stress, in the form of ROS and RNS, can be damaging to all liver cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells, through induction of inflammation, ischemia, fibrosis, necrosis, apoptosis, or through malignant transformation by damaging lipids, proteins, and/or DNA. In Part I of this review, we will discuss basic redox biology in the liver, including a review of ROS, RNS, and antioxidants, with a focus on nitric oxide as a common source of RNS. We will then review the evidence for oxidative stress as a mechanism of liver injury in hepatitis (alcoholic, viral, nonalcoholic). In Part II of this review, we will review oxidative stress in common pathophysiologic conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, iron overload, Wilson's disease, sepsis, and acetaminophen overdose. Finally, biomarkers, proteomic, and antioxidant therapies will be discussed as areas for future therapeutic interventions."
41443212,Predictive Value of Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index in the Prognosis of Sepsis-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,2025,"Aims/Background The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was an independent influence factor for mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a predictive indicator for sepsis. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of combined NLR and SII in sepsis-related ARDS. Methods Patients with sepsis-related ARDS (n = 112), admitted to Pingyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2022 to January 2025, were obtained for retrospective analysis. A survivor group (n = 62) and a non-survivor group (n = 50) were formed based on 28-day survival status. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts were detected, and NLR and SII were subsequently calculated. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to analyze the influences of NLR and SII in the prognosis of sepsis-related ARDS. Results Non-survivor group has longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and white blood cell (WBC) count, and lower lymphocyte count than those of survivor group (p = 0.001, 0.032, 0.028, 0.004, respectively). Both NLR and SII values were elevated in the non-survivor group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR): 1.150, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004-1.317, p = 0.044), ICU length of stay (OR: 1.147, 95% CI: 1.017-1.294, p = 0.026), NLR (OR: 1.158, 95% CI: 1.068-1.255, p < 0.001), and SII >2090.37 (OR: 5.207, 95% CI: 1.800-15.064, p = 0.002) as independent prognostic risk factors. The combined NLR and SII had a superior predictive value (area under the curve (AUC): 0.808, 95% CI: 0.730-0.887, p < 0.001) compared to APACHE II score (AUC: 0.618, 95% CI: 0.503-0.733, p = 0.045), ICU length of stay (AUC: 0.679, 95% CI: 0.573-0.784, p = 0.001), NLR alone (AUC: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.701-0.875, p < 0.001), or SII alone (AUC: 0.748, 95% CI: 0.657-0.840, p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off values for APACHE II score, ICU length of stay, NLR, and SII were 19.5, 15.5, 26.13, and 2090.37, respectively. Conclusion The combination of NLR and SII provides a strong predictive value for the prognosis of sepsis-related ARDS."
18470710,"Procalcitonin for early diagnosis and differentiation of SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.",2000,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of procalcitonin (PCT) in the early diagnosis (and differentiation) of patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in comparison to C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell and thrombocyte count, and APACHE-II score (AP-II). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with the suspected diagnosis of infection over a 7-month period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 185 patients were included: 17 patients with SIRS, 61 with sepsis, 68 with severe sepsis, and 39 patients with septic shock. CRP, cell counts, AP-II and PCT were evaluated on the first day after onset of inflammatory symptoms. RESULTS: PCT values were highest in patients with septic shock (12.89+/-4.39 ng/ml;P<0.05 vs patients with severe sepsis). Patients with severe sepsis had significantly higher PCT levels than patients with sepsis or SIRS (6.91+/-3.87 ng/ml vs 0.53+/-2.9 ng/ml;P<0.001, and 0.41+/-3.04 ng/ml;P<0.001, respectively). AP-II scores did not differ significantly between sepsis, severe sepsis and SIRS (19.26+/-1.62, 16.09+/-2.06, and 17.42+/-1.72 points, respectively), but was significantly higher in patients with septic shock (29.27+/-1.35,P<0.001 vs patients with severe sepsis). Neither CRP, cell counts, nor the degree of fever showed significant differences between sepsis and severe sepsis, whereas white blood cell count and platelet count differed significantly between severe sepsis and septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to AP-II, PCT appears to be a useful early marker to discriminate between sepsis and severe sepsis."
20036520,Evaluation of the activity of fusidic acid tested against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates from the USA and Canada.,2010,"We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of fusidic acid (CEM-102) against 1140 clinical strains of Gram-positive bacteria obtained from patients with bacteraemia or skin and skin-structure infections collected in more than 30 medical centres in the USA and Canada over a 10-year period (1997-2006). Fusidic acid was very active against meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), with MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration encompassing 90% of isolates tested) at 0.12mug/mL for US strains of MSSA, MRSA and CoNS and 0.25mug/mL for Canadian strains of MSSA and MRSA. A progressive increase in fusidic acid resistance was observed among Canadian strains of S. aureus (12.2% in 2005-2006) and among Canadian strains of CoNS. In contrast, no fusidic acid resistance was detected among US S. aureus strains and only 1.5% among CoNS. Fusidic acid was equally active against community-acquired MRSA and linezolid-resistant staphylococci. Fusidic acid exhibited equal or greater potency against staphylococci compared with vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid."
31821331,Serum procalcitonin as an independent diagnostic markers of bacteremia in febrile patients with hematologic malignancies.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are biomarkers of infection. In patients with hematologic disorders with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), it is difficult to distinguish bloodstream infections from aseptic causes of febrile episodes. The objective of this study was to investigate diagnostic values of PCT and CRP in predicting systemic bacterial infection in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of 614 febrile episode cases from 511 patients were analyzed. Febrile episodes were classified into four groups: (1) culture-positive bacterial infection by Gram-positive cocci (GPC), (2) culture-positive bacterial infection by Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), (3) fungal infection, and (4) viral infection or a noninfectious etiology. RESULTS: Of 614 febrile cases, systemic bacterial infections were confirmed in 99 (16.1%) febrile episodes, including 38 (6.2%) GPC and 61 (9.9%) GNB infections. PCT levels were significantly higher in GNB infectious episodes than those in febrile episodes caused by fungal infection (0.58 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.26-1.61) vs. 0.22 ng/mL (0.16-0.38), P = 0.047). Bacterial infectious episodes showed higher PCT and CRP levels than non-bacterial events (PCT: 0.49 (0.26-0.93) ng/mL vs. 0.20 (0.18-0.22) ng/mL, P < 0.001; CRP: 76.6 (50.5-92.8) mg/L vs. 58.0 (51.1-66.5) mg/L, P = 0.036). For non-neutropenic febrile episodes, both PCT and CRP discriminated bacteremia from non-bacteremia. However, in neutropenic febrile episodes, PCT only distinguished bacteremia from non-bacteremia. In non-neutropenic episode, both PCT and CRP showed good diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.757 vs. 0.763). In febrile neutropenia, only PCT discriminated bacteremia from non-bacterial infection (AUC: 0.624) whereas CRP could not detect bacteremia (AUC: 0.500, 95% CI: 0.439-0.561, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center observational study, PCT was more valuable than CRP for discriminating between bacteremia and non-bacteremia independent of neutropenia or HSCT."
25501966,Sepsis in Poland: why do we die?,2015,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the adverse events and potential risk factors in patients who develop sepsis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five medico-legal opinion forms relating to sepsis cases issued by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland, between 2004 and 2013 were analyzed for medical errors and risk factors for adverse events. RESULTS: The most common causes of medical errors were a lack of knowledge in recognition, diagnosis and therapy as well as ignorance of risk. The common risk factors for adverse events were deferral of a diagnostic or therapeutic decision, high-level anxiety of patients or their families about the patient's health and actively seeking for help. The most significant risk factors were communication errors, not enough medical staff, stereotype-based thinking about diseases and providing easy explanations for serious symptoms. CONCLUSION: The most common cause of adverse events related to sepsis in the Polish health-care system was a lack of knowledge about the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment as well as the ignoring of danger. A possible means of improving safety might be through spreading knowledge and creating medical management algorithms for all health-care workers, especially physicians."

The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Experimentation of Ramathibodi Hospital Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University. The volunteers received unison enema one day before and Ciprofloxacin 500 mg 0.5-1 hr before the procedure. These 100 volunteers were divided into two groups; 50 were randomly assigned in the group of rectum cleaning with 10% povidone-iodine, whereas the other 50 volunteers were placed in the control group. Twelve cores of TRUS guided prostate biopsy were performed After the procedure, peripheral blood samples were taken for cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A clinical follow-up at 48-72 hrs after the procedure was done via telephone. RESULTS: Hemocultures were positive for 9 cases in the rectum cleaning group and 2 cases in the control group (p = 0.025). Three volunteers (one in the rectum cleaning group and two in the control group) had a postoperative fever but it spontaneously resolved. Two volunteers in the control group came back to the hospital because of urinary tract infections and rectal bleeding. None of the volunteers had clinical sepsis or went to other hospitals. CONCLUSION: Sterilization of the rectum before TRUS guided prostate biopsy was found to reduce postoperative bacteremia and might reduce clinical infections."
32010265,Antithrombin III expression predicts acute kidney injury in elderly patients with sepsis.,2020,"Elderly people represent the age group most frequently affected by acute kidney injury (AKI). The potential of Antithrombin III (ATIII) level for predicting AKI among elderly patients with sepsis is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ability of ATIII to predict AKI nondevelopment and prognosis in elderly patients with sepsis, in an intensive care unit (ICU). The present study was retrospective and included 107 elderly patients with sepsis who had been admitted to ICUs between October 2015 and March 2018. An assessment of renal function was performed daily by measuring serum creatinine (Cr) level and urine output, and ATIII level was obtained within 48 h of sepsis diagnosis. Among all enrolled patients, 29 (27.1%) developed AKI. ATIII expression was a predictor of AKI nondevelopment [Area under the curve (AUC)-Receiving operator characteristic (ROC)=0.729; sensitivity, 0.700; specificity, 0.714], and the ATIII/Creatine ratio was also a predictor of AKI nondevelopment (AUC-ROC=0.971; sensitivity, 0.900; specificity, 1). The accuracy of ATIII (AUC-ROC=0.681; sensitivity, 0.802; specificity, 0.542) and ATIII/Cr (AUC-ROC=0.804; sensitivity, 0.596; specificity, 0.875) in predicting survival was intermediate. However, the ATIII serum level was able to accurately predict AKI nondevelopment in elderly patients with sepsis, who were admitted to ICUs. Patients were divided into low- and high-ATIII groups using either 66.95% or 55.7% as cut-off values, both of which were used for further analysis. By comparison, the ICU stay was significantly lower in the high-ATIII group [P=0.020 (69.95%) and 0.049 (55.7%)] and off mechanical ventilation time, off continuous renal replacement therapy time and survival time were significantly higher in the high ATIII group [P=0.049, 0.048, and 0.014, respectively (66.95%); and P=0.041, 0.036, and 0.021, respectively (55.7%)]. The current study indicated that ATIII serum level predicts AKI in elderly patients with sepsis, and that low ATIII levels predicted a poorer prognosis."
31860129,Potentially burdensome end-of-life transitions among nursing home residents with poor-prognosis cancer.,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study examined factors associated with potentially burdensome end-of-life (EOL) transitions between care settings among older adults with advanced cancer in nursing homes (NHs). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of deceased older NH residents with poor-prognosis solid tumors was conducted with Medicare claims and the Minimum Data Set. A potentially burdensome transition was defined as 2 or more hospitalizations or an intensive care unit admission in the last 90 days of life. RESULTS: Among 34,670 subjects, many had moderate to severe cognitive impairment (53.8%), full dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs; 66.5%), and comorbidities such as congestive heart failure (CHF; 29.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (34.1%). Only 56.3% of the patients used hospice at any time in the 90 days before death; 36.0% of the patients experienced a potentially burdensome EOL transition, and this was higher among patients who did not receive hospice (45.4% vs 28.7%; P < .01). In multivariable analyses, full dependence in ADLs (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; P < .01), CHF (OR, 1.48; P < .01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.28; P < .01) were associated with a higher risk of burdensome EOL transitions. Those with do-not-resuscitate directives (OR, 0.60; P < .01) and impaired cognition (OR, 0.89; P < .01) had lower odds of burdensome EOL transitions. CONCLUSIONS: NH residents with advanced cancer have substantial comorbidities and functional impairment, yet more than a third experience potentially burdensome EOL transitions. These findings help to identify a population at risk for poor EOL outcomes in order to target interventions, and they point to the importance of advanced care planning in this population."
31828087,Plasma and Renal Cortex Meropenem Concentrations in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Renal Biopsy.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in the world. Some cases can have serious complication as death by septic shock. With the increasing spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the therapeutic possibilities against the complicated UTI are exhausted, forcing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as meropenem. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the penetrating ability of meropenem to renal tissue using an enzymatic biosensor in samples of renal cortex and its correlation with plasma levels. METHOD: We conducted a descriptive study in humans with indication of kidney biopsy. Meropenem was administered 1 hour before performing the biopsy, and the concentrations of meropenem in a series of samples of plasma and renal biopsy were determined. RESULTS: Renal biopsy and plasma samples of 14 patients, 64% women with body mass index of 26.3 kg/m(2) (SD +/- 2.9) and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 57.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SD +/- 44.1), were examined. Renal biopsy was done at 68.9 minutes (SD +/- 20.3), and the second plasma sample was obtained at 82.1 minutes (SD +/- 21.2) and the third at 149.6 minutes (SD +/- 31.5). The mean kidney meropenem concentration was 3.1 mug/mL (SD +/- 1.9). For each patient, a decay curve of plasma meropenem concentration was constructed. The proportion of meropenem concentrations in renal tissue and plasma at biopsy moment was 14% (SD +/- 10) with an interquartile range of 5.5-20.3%. With normal renal function, meropenem can achieve a bactericidal effect towards bacteria with MIC-90 < 0.76 mug/mL in the renal parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem is effective to treat the most frequent uropathogens with the bactericidal effect. Nevertheless, for resistant bacteria, it is necessary to adjust the dose to achieve adequate parenchymal concentration."
15597798,[Evaluation of severity for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis].,2004,"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is defined by four simple clinical and laboratory indices and now widely accepted for diagnosing sepsis. However, since the SIRS criteria include patients with a wide range of severity, other parameters are necessary to evaluate the severity and outcome of the patients. In this review, we discussed several methods to estimate the severity of SIRS, such as number of positive SIRS indices among four, duration of SIRS, plasma IL-6 and procalcitonin, etc."
41408189,"Catheter‑related bloodstream infections and risk factors in infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units at Mogadishu, Somalia: two years of experience.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections in neonates and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the incidence of CRBSIs and to examine the risk factors, clinical characteristics, and microbial profiles of CRBSIs, with emphasis on catheter type and birth weight classification. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Mogadishu-Somalia-Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan Training and Research Hospital. Medical records of neonates admitted between January 2022 and December 2024 were reviewed. Of 1,781 neonates admitted, 300 met the inclusion criteria according to the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for CRBSI diagnosis, which include paired blood cultures, catheter tip cultures, or differential time to positivity. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23, including Spearman's correlation and multivariable logistic regression to identify independent risk factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,781 neonates were admitted to the NICU, of whom 300 developed CRBSIs, corresponding to an incidence of 16.8%. Of these, 60% were male and 40% female. The majority (53%) were born between 36 and 42 weeks of gestation, while 29.3% had birth weights > 2,500 g. Significant associations were observed between prognosis and parameters including birth weight, gestational age, catheter type, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and culture sample type (p < 0.005). Analysis of culture results showed that Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by E. coli and Candida spp. A significant correlation was identified between cathetertype and isolate type (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the highest frequency of Gram-negative isolates was observed among preterm gestational age groups (p = 0.002). Regarding antimicrobial resistance, Gram-negative isolates exhibited high resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Gram-positive isolates, including MRSA and MRCNS, showed substantial resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Among neonates in Mogadishu, low birth weight, preterm gestational age, catheter type, and elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with CRBSI prognosis. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance among both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens underscores the urgent need for strengthened antimicrobial stewardship and infection control measures in neonatal intensive care units."
26484145,Comparison of genomic DNA methylation pattern among septic and non-septic newborns - An epigenome wide association study.,2015,"DNA methylation is the current strategy in the field of biomarker discovery due to its prognostic efficiency. Its role in prognosis and early diagnosis has been recognized in various types of cancer. Sepsis still remains one of the major causes of neonatal mortality. Delay in diagnosis of sepsis leads to treatment difficulties and poor outcome. In this study, we have done an epigenome wide search to identify potential markers for prognosis of neonatal sepsis which may improve the treatment strategies. We analyzed the CpG methylation status in the epigenome of three septic and non-septic babies using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K methylation microarray. The microarray data was analyzed with Illumina GenomeStudio v2011.1. After screening for biological and clinical significance, we found 81 differentially methylated CpGs located in 64 genes. Bioinformatic analysis using DAVID and GeneMania revealed a panel of differentially methylated protocadherin beta (PCDHB) genes that play vital role in leukocyte cell adhesion and Wnt signaling pathway. Apart, genes like CCS, DNAJA3, and DEGS2 were potentially hyper/hypo methylated which can be utilized in the development of novel biomarkers. This study will be helpful in exploring the role of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of neonatal sepsis. The complete microarray data can be accessed from the public domain, Gene Expression Omnibus of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The accession number is GSE58651."
41529005,Prediction of mortality by nSOFA Score for late-onset sepsis in very low birth weight infants.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment are of great importance. This study aims to evaluate the role of the Neonatal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (nSOFA) score in predicting the causal agents and outcomes of late-onset sepsis in preterm neonates. METHODOLOGY: In this single-center, retrospectively designed study, nSOFA scores of preterm infants born before 32 gestational weeks and weighing under 1500 g with a diagnosis of culture-proven late-onset sepsis (LOS) were compared at different timepoints in relation to mortality. RESULTS: Thirteen of 117 preterms included in the study died. At all the timepoints examined, the median nSOFA score was found to be higher in the mortality group (all p < 0.001). A 3.5 cutoff value of nSOFA showed the best differentiation, with AUC = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00), 100% sensitivity, and 91.4% specificity. When nSOFA scores were compared in patients grouped as gram-positive sepsis and gram-negative sepsis, scores at T0, T6, T12, and T24 timepoints were determined to be significantly higher in the exitus group (all p < 0.008). In preterm infants born before 28 gestational weeks, mortality was predicted with the 3.5 cutoff value at T6, T12, T24, and T48 timepoints (AUC = 0.947, 0.943, 0.972, and 0.940, respectively, all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the nSOFA score is useful for predicting sepsis-related mortality in preterm infants and correlates with the severity of gram-negative sepsis."
18159409,Imported from Cuba?,2002,"A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency room complaining of fever, chills, diarrhea and nausea with vomiting of two days' duration. He had a past medical history of remote jejunal dysplasia, which was surgically corrected when he was a child. He was taking no regular medications. He had been well until two days earlier, when he developed a sudden onset of fever to 39.9 degrees C, chills and severe nausea with frequent bouts of vomiting. He remembered feeling more tired than usual for three days before the onset of his fever, but nothing more specific. He saw a physician the day after the onset of fever, and the physician prescribed oral cotrimoxazole double-strength, of which he took one dose. Due to persistence of the above symptoms, he presented to the emergency room. He had travelled to Cuba for a seven-day vacation at a resort, and returned home 14 days before the onset of symptoms. He had experienced one day of mild diarrhea while in Cuba, but two of his friends experienced two to three days of diarrhea without fever at the same time while there. He denied abdominal pain, headache, cough, shortness of breath, rash, urinary symptoms or other problems. He had no risk factors for HIV infection. On examination, he was toxic and experiencing rigors, but was awake and alert. His temperature was 39.8 degrees C, pulse was 107 beats/min and respirations were 30 breaths/min. The examination was normal except for evidence of dehydration and marked splenomegaly without tenderness. A chest radiograph and urinalysis were normal. The patient's hemoglobin level was 167 g/L, his platelet count was 138x10(9)/L and his leukocyte count was 9.5x10(9)/L with a marked shift to the left. The patient's creatinine level was 139 mumol/L, urea level was 6.8 mmol/L, total bilirubin level was 48 mumol/L (44% conjugated), alanine aminotransferase level was 113 U/L and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase level was 83 U/L. Other liver function tests were normal. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of splenomegaly with a tiny splenic cyst and an otherwise normal examination (including a normal liver). Infectious enteritis with sepsis was diagnosed and the patient was started on intravenous ciprofloxacin. The following day, two sets of blood cultures that were taken while the patient was in the emergency room showed the presence of Gram-negative rods, which were identified the next day as Salmonella species (serogroup C1), susceptible to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, fluoroquinolones and ceftriaxone. After three days of taking parenteral ciprofloxacin, the patient felt subjectively better but continued to have afternoon and evening fevers of more than 40 degrees C, accompanied by rigors and extreme exhaustion. His platelets decreased daily, to a nadir of 49x10(9)/L, and his leukocytes decreased to 3.8x10(9)/L. HIV serology was negative. He had no other new complaints, and the examination was unchanged. Repeat blood cultures were negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed to explain the persistent sepsis. What is your diagnosis?"
25677555,Potential use of procalcitonin as biomarker for bacterial sepsis in patients with or without acute kidney injury.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: There are few investigations regarding the relationships between procalcitonin (PCT) and the acute kidney injury (AKI) in the diagnosis of sepsis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of the use of PCT levels in patients with or without AKI. METHODS: This study was conducted as a single-center retrospective study. We enrolled 393 patients in whom PCT were measured on admission. We grouped the patients into non-AKI and AKI, and those with AKI were classified according to the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure). The patients in each group were further classified into the sepsis and the non-sepsis group. We subsequently investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the PCT for detecting sepsis in these groups. RESULTS: The levels of PCT were significantly higher in the sepsis group than in the non-sepsis group among the non-AKI and each AKI patients (p < 0.0001). The diagnostic accuracy of the PCT for detecting sepsis was determined according to a ROC analysis; AUC value was 0.958 in the non-AKI group, in the Risk, Injury and Failure groups were 0.888 and 0.917, 0.857, respectively. AUC value for non-AKI group was significantly different from that of Failure group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In Failure AKI patients, the diagnostic accuracy of the PCT level is significantly lower than non-AKI patients. It is therefore suggested that we should be careful in using PCT value to diagnose sepsis in patients with Failure under RIFLE criteria."
20156708,[Transfusion-related acute lung injury].,2010,"The term Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) was coined in 1985. It is a relatively rare, life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by acute respiratory failure and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema during or following a blood transfusion. Although its true incidence is unknown, a rate 1 out of every 5000 transfusions has been quoted. TRALI has been the most common cause of transfusion-related fatalities during three years in the USA. Two different etiologies have been proposed. The first is a single antibody-mediated event involving the transfusion of anti-HLA or antigranulocyte antibodies into patients whose leukocytes express the cognate antigens. The second is a two-event model: the first event is related to the clinical condition of the patient (sepsis, trauma, etc.) resulting in pulmonary endothelial activation and neutrophil sequestration, and the second event is the transfusion of a biologic response modifier that activates these adherent polymorphonuclear leukocytes resulting in endothelial damage and capillary leak. The patient management is support as needed based on the severity of the clinical picture and strategies to prevent TRALI are focused on: donor-exclusion policies, product management strategies and avoidance of unnecessary transfusions."
27267647,Miliary tuberculosis: a severe opportunistic infection in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus patients.,2016,"INTRODUCTION: One of the main issues in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) patients is infection, such as tuberculosis (TB). Of note, SLE patients are susceptible to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. However, to our knowledge, this contagious disease was rarely reported in pediatric lupus population, particularly diffuse or miliary TB. Therefore, from January 1983 to December 2011, 5,635 patients were followed-up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 285 (5%) of them met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. CASE REPORTS: Four (1.4%) of our JSLE patients had disseminated TB and were described herein. All of them were female gender, received BCG vaccination and did not have a history of TB household contact. The median of current age at TB diagnosis and the period between JSLE and TB diagnosis were 17 years old (range 14-20) and 5.5 years (range 2-7), respectively. All patients developed miliary TB during the course of the disease. The median of SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 4 (2-16) and the patients were treated with immunosuppressive agents (glucocorticoid, azathioprine and/or intravenous cyclophosphamide). Two of them presented sepsis and TB diagnosis was only established at autopsy, especially with lungs, central nervous system and abdominal involvements. Anti-TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide) was indicated in the other two TB cases, however they deceased. DISCUSSION: Miliary TB is a rare and severe opportunist infection in pediatric lupus population. This study reinforces the importance of routine searches for TB in JSLE patients."
20046106,"[A case of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) sepsis complicated by meningoencephalitis and cerebral abscess, successfully treated with linezolid].",2009,"The authors describe a clinical case regarding a young female patient affected by sepsis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), associated to meningoencephalitis and cerebral abscess. The patient had no contact with hospitals in the months prior to illness and had always been healthy. She recovered thanks to linezolid therapy. The MRSA strain proved positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL positive) and was therefore defined as community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA)."
25511966,Use of allogenic (iliac) corticocancellous graft for Le Fort I interpositional defects: technique and results.,2015,"PURPOSE: We performed a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 50 patients who had undergone Le Fort I with interpositional grafting during a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maxillary repositioning included horizontal advancement and vertical and transverse change to the extent that an interpositional graft was considered necessary. Allogenic (iliac) corticocancellous bone was used in all cases. Each patient underwent analytic model planning to document the maxillary vector change data points. The recorded data served as an indicator of the osteotomy site gaps requiring grafting. Standardized photographs in centric relation at a minimum of 12 months after treatment were analyzed to measure overjet, overbite, midline position, and first molar lateral occlusion. Specific maxillary region wound healing parameters were reviewed. RESULTS: The patients' mean age at surgery was 32 years (range 15 to 60). Analytic model planning clarified that the study patients had an average of 8 mm horizontal advancement, 2 mm vertical lengthening, and 2 mm of transverse expansion. The data confirmed a favorable occlusion at a minimum of 1 year after surgery with maintenance of a normal overjet (49 of 50 patients, 98%), normal overbite (48 of 50 patients, 96%), planned dental midline positioning (45 of 50 patients, 90%), and ideal first molar lateral occlusion (48 of 50 patients, 96%) for most patients. None of the study patients sustained wound healing complications. Also, no cases of postoperative sepsis or viral illness developed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have confirmed that iliac corticocancellous allograft has minimal systemic or recipient site complications and can be safely used to fill complex 3-dimensional interpositional defects associated with Le Fort I osteotomy and/or repositioning."
25584223,Neonatal septicaemia caused by vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium-a case report.,2014,Neonatal bacterial sepsis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in neonates. 10% cases of neonatal bacteraemia and septicaemia are caused by Enterococci. The increasing incidence of Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) is of particular concern because of limited treatment options and increased mortality. We report here a case of neonatal sepsis in a premature baby caused by vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium Van A phenotype from a tertiary care Hospital in South India. A preterm baby boy with low birth weight was admitted to the NICU with Respiratory distress and meconium aspiration. On 5(th) day the baby succumbed to death and a final diagnosis of respiratory distress and meconium aspiration with sepsis was made. Blood cultures sent yielded vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (minimum inhibitory concentration >/= 256 mug/ml). It was confirmed as Enterococcus feacium Van A phenotype by Automated Vitek system.
31888631,"Group B Streptococcus detection in pregnant women: comparison of qPCR assay, culture, and the Xpert GBS rapid test.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most important causative agents of neonatal sepsis. As administration of prophylactic antibiotics during labor can prevent GBS infection, routine screening for this bacterium in prenatal care before the onset of labor is recommended. However, many women present in labor without having undergone such testing during antenatal care, and the turnaround time of detection methods is insufficient for results to be obtained before delivery. METHODS: Vaginal and anorectal specimens were collected from 270 pregnant women. Each sample was tested by Xpert GBS, qPCR, and culture for GBS detection. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of maternal GBS colonization was 30.7% according to Xpert GBS, 51.1% according to qPCR, and 14.3% according to cultures. Considering the qPCR method as the reference, the Xpert GBS had a sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 93%. Positive Xpert GBS results were correlated to marital status (married or cohabitating) and with prematurity as a cause of neonatal hospitalization. Positive cultures were related with ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy requiring therapeutic hypothermia. CONCLUSIONS: Combined enrichment/qPCR and the Xpert GBS rapid test found a high prevalence of GBS colonization. The Xpert GBS technique gives faster results and could be useful for evaluating mothers who present without antenatal GBS screening results and are at risk of preterm labor, thus allowing institution of prophylactic antibiotic therapy."
15599467,Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia.,2004,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important nosocomial pathogen with intrinsic multi-drug resistance. This retrospective study reviewed 84 episodes of S. maltophilia bacteremia over a 4-year period from July 1999 to September 2003. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 64 patients (76%), and developed after prolonged hospitalization in 48 (57%). Seventy patients (83%) had a central venous catheter (CVC), 64 (76%) had prior antibiotic therapy, 55 (65%) had underlying malignancy, and 43 (51%) were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Twenty seven percent of the episodes of bacteremia had polymicrobial isolates. The overall and bacteremia-related mortality rates were 44% and 33%, respectively. Forty six percent of the bacteremia-related mortality occurred within 3 days after onset of symptoms. The most common sources of bacteremia were respiratory tract (33%) and CVC (31%), while the source of the bacteremia was unknown in 26% of episodes. The most effective antibiotics in vitro were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and ceftazidime; however, a trend of increasing drug resistance in these agents was identified over the study period. On univariate analysis, nosocomial bacteremia, long-lasting neutropnenia (>10 days), bacteremia originating from the respiratory tract, shock, low serum albumin level (<3 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mm3) were significantly related to mortality (p<0.05). Among these variables, shock and thrombocytopenia were independent factors associated with mortality. In contrast, patients with CVC-related bacteremia had a lower mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.04; p<0.001). Patients treated with appropriate antibiotics had a lower mortality rate, but this difference was not significant (p=0.477). In S. maltophilia bacteremia, careful evaluation of CVC was important for identifying the source of bacteremia and predicting prognosis. The source of bacteremia and condition of patients at presentation were the major factors influencing prognosis."
31929805,"Prevalence and Management of Septic Shock among Children Admitted at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Longitudinal Survey.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric septic shock is a subset of sepsis associated with high mortality. Implementing the existing international Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2012 (SSCG) have contributed to reduction of mortality in many places but these have not been adopted in our setting. The current study aimed at documenting the practice at a national referral hospital. METHODS: A hospital based longitudinal survey carried out among 325 children from September to October 2016. Children aged 0 days (>/=37 weeks gestation) to12 years were included. The aim was to determine the prevalence, audit the management and determine the outcome at 72 hours of septic shock among children admitted at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). A standard questionnaire was used for data collection and Surviving Sepsis Guideline 2012 was used as a reference for auditing the management of septic shock. Data was stored in MS-EXCEL and analysed in STATA 12. RESULTS: The prevalence of septic shock was 50 (15.4%), with a median age of 4 months. Septic shock was recognized by the attending clinician in 28 (56%). The level of care to children with septic shock was not to the level recommended by the SSCG 2012. Odds of being diagnosed with septic shock reduced with age (odds ratio 4.38 (1.7-11.0), p = 0.002) and no child aged above 60 months age was diagnosed with septic shock. The mortality was 35 (70%) at 72 hours of admission, with a median of 14 hours. Infants had the highest case fatality of 82.6%. It was found that lack of mechanical ventilation, and presence of hypotension at admission were associated with greater mortality (p values of 0.03 and 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of septic shock is 15.4% among children admitted at the KNH and is associated with high mortality. The advanced degree of shock contributed to mortality. The level of care at KNH was not to the level of SSCG 2012, and hence the need to include septic shock management guidelines/protocols in our local Kenyan paediatric guideline."
41502864,Blood culture practices and microbiological capacity for sepsis diagnostics in Europe (2021-2022): a cross-sectional analysis of the European Sepsis Care Survey.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Blood cultures (BCs) are key diagnostic elements for sepsis patients. Accurate preanalytical procedures are substantial, and results should be available as soon as possible to guide adequate antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to evaluate BC collection practices and diagnostic capacity across European hospitals. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey investigated BC diagnostics in acute care hospitals across 37 European countries in the years 2021 and 2022. Analyses included BC guidelines, collection sites, number of BC sets in emergency departments (EDs), wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). We also examined transfer after collection, the use of on-site vs. external laboratories, opening hours, rapid testing capacity, and turn-around times of BCs processed in microbiology laboratories with different infrastructures. FINDINGS: Responses were collected from 907 hospitals in Europe. BC guidelines were available in 84.4% (741/878) of the hospitals. BCs were preferably collected by multiple-site sampling in EDs (62.7%, 461/735), in wards (64.0%, 513/802) and ICUs (68.5%, 518/756). One BC set was preferred in EDs in 38.4% (270/704), in wards in 40.5% (314/775), and ICUs in 34.9% (261/748). Two BC sets were preferred in EDs in 31.0% (218/704), in wards in 28.1% (218/775), and ICUs in 39.2% (293/748). 48.0% (402/838) of hospitals used on-site and 52.0% (436/838) external microbiology laboratories. Around-the-clock microbiological services were available in 10⋅0% (91/907), and rapid pathogen identification in 43.7% (396/907) of hospitals. Infrastructure with around-the-clock microbiological service and rapid testing was available in 7.4% (62/840) of hospitals, and probability of a final microbiological result within two days was highest in these hospitals compared to hospitals with limited microbiology service (for BC collected on wards: 19.6% vs. 52.7%, Odds Ratio 4.59 [95% CI 2.50-7.79], p < 0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Despite the availability of BC guidelines in many hospitals, current recommendations for BC collection were often neglected. Rapid testing capacity was limited in most microbiological laboratories, and around-the-clock service for BCs was very rare. As delay in results may have a detrimental impact on patient outcomes, strategies to improve these processes are urgently needed.

15655722,[Microbiological findings in children with an indwelling central venous catheter].,2004,"INTRODUCTION: Besides their obvious advantages for the patient, central venous catheters (CVC) also carry the risk of possible infectious complications. The purpose of our investigation was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of a 5-year set of paediatric patients with indwelling CVCs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the group were 218 CVCs inserted to 165 children over a period of 5 years. There were 26 multi-lumen catheters (11.927 %) and 192 single-lumen catheters (88.073 %). The mean indwelling period was 10.1 days per 1 CVC. Blood for microbiology was removed by a physician from the CVC after disinfecting its opening under standard sterile conditions into a commercial sampling vessel HEMOD (Imuna, Sarisske Michalany, Slovak Republic) or into a vessel of an automated haemoculture system BactecPeds PLUS/F (Becton Dickinson and Comp., Spark,MA, USA). When removing the tip of the CVC we disinfected, before removing the CVC, the area around the insertion with isopropyl or ethyl alcohol. We released the fixed CVC and 1 minute after disinfection we pulled out the CVC and cut off the end or rather the tip of the catheter (approx. 1-3 cm of the tip) into a sterile test tube. To establish the diagnosis of infectious complications we used the 1995 Sirges-Serra classification and the CDC criteria. RESULTS: In 5 years (1995-1999) we had 71 infectious complications. There were 31 contaminated catheters, 27 cases of catheter sepsis and 11 cases of catheter bacteraemia. With 147 catheters (67.43%) there were no infectious complications. Dominant microbes were Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 cases - 11 from haemocultures and 21 from CVCs) and Candida spp. (30 cases, 17 from haemocultures and 13 from CVCs). Among the microbiological agents of catheter sepsis predominated Gram-negative bacteria. Out of the whole analysed group 41 children (24.8 %) died. CVC as the cause of death was demonstrated in 6 children (3.636 % of patients with CVC). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological findings in our group are in line with literary data. To reduce the incidence of infectious complications it is important to limit sampling from CVC to a minimum. Insertion of CVCs under strict sterile conditions and aseptic handling of all entries into the central bloodstream reduces to a minimum the risk of infectious complications."
19932646,Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis of the scapula in children.,2009,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Osteomyelitis of the scapula is uncommon, often with a misleading clinical presentation. We report four cases of osteomyelitis of the scapula to illustrate the particular clinical imaging findings and treatment related to this location. CASE REPORTS: Between 1996 and 2006, four children were treated for osteomyelitis of the scapula, three boys and one girl, with a mean age of 8 years (range, 5-11 years). The time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 2 days. Pain was noted for all patients and total functional incapacity of the upper extremity was noted for three patients. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the scapula was established on the basis of imaging (ultrasound and CT scan). All patients were given medical treatment and underwent surgery. A positive bacteriology was noted in all patients. The bacterium isolated from blood cultures (two cases) and local samples obtained at the surgical site (four cases) were Meti-S Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The results were analyzed by studying the anatomic and functional outcome at a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 16-60 months). The patients were pain-free and had full range of motion in their shoulders. There were no complications. DISCUSSION: Few reports are available in the literature on osteomyelitis of the scapula. We discuss the specific clinical and imaging features as well as the treatment for this location."
25578685,"Epidemiology of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections in Alberta, Canada.",2015,"Most studies of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection (BSI) reflect a convenience sample from a single hospital or a small group of hospitals. From April 2011 to March 2013, cases of MRSA BSI diagnosed in all hospitals in Alberta, Canada were captured prospectively. Isolates were spa typed. In total, there were 299 cases of MRSA BSI, equating to 3.95 cases per 100,000 population. Community-acquired BSI accounted for 66.9% of cases, and 33.1% of cases were hospital acquired. Cases were predominantly seen in tertiary care (36.4%) and large urban hospitals (34.3%), but were also common in regional and rural hospitals. Paediatric hospitals had very few cases (3.0%). Two clones, CMRSA 10 (USA 300; 40.2%) and CMRSA 2 (USA 100/800; 38.0%), predominated."
15589311,The eye in systemic inflammatory diseases.,2004,"Systemic inflammatory diseases commonly affect the sclera, cornea, retina, and orbit, and can pose a serious threat to sight. They encompass both primary and secondary vasculitic disorders and specific granulomatous inflammatory conditions. As well as direct eye involvement from the systemic inflammatory process, there can be signs of ocular ischaemia due to carotid or ophthalmic arteritis, hypertensive retinopathy, and ocular complications such as chloroquine maculopathy related to anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Additionally, systemic infection relating to the eye, either as the result of primary infective disease processes or infection secondary to immunosuppression, might be mistaken as endogenous intraocular inflammation. Infection can closely mimic the ocular signs of endogenous inflammation, and in selected patients (such as those who have been immunosuppressed to treat vasculitis and who additionally have had invasive surgery, indwelling intravenous catheters, or systemic sepsis), it might be necessary to specifically exclude infection by the sampling and culturing of intraocular fluids and tissue."
19947999,Eosinopenia as a marker of mortality and length of stay in patients admitted with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2010,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blood eosinopenia has long been known as a marker of acute infection, and has recently been shown to be a better predictor of sepsis than CRP in critically ill patients. This study examines the usefulness of eosinopenia (< or = 0.04), for predicting the severity of exacerbations of COPD using inpatient mortality and length of stay as markers of severity. METHODS: Retrospective review of the case-notes of patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD from March 2007 to April 2008. Patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and those having steroids in the previous week were excluded. Data were collected for age, length of stay, pH, WCC and mortality. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 42 with a normal eosinophil count and 23 with eosinopenia. No significant differences were seen between the two groups' age, total WCC and admission pH. However, significant differences were seen in mortality (4/23 (17.4%) vs 1/42 (2.4%), P = 0.049) and length of stay (8 vs 5 days, P = 0.005) when the eosinopenia group compared with those with normal eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophil count might be a useful marker of severity inpatients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD independent of the WCC and pH. As it is routinely given in the full blood count in all patients admitted to hospital, there is no extra cost for this beneficial test."
41421230,Mmu_Circ_0001022/hsa_Circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI axis suppressed the progression of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,2026,"Sepsis -associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) contributes substantially to mortality and morbidity in critically ill individuals. Although considerable investigation has been conducted, effective therapeutic strategies preventing its advancement remain unavailable, highlighting the importance of understanding its fundamental mechanisms. Previous research identified mmu_circ_26986/hsa_circ_0072463 as a prospective biomarker and treatment target for SA-AKI. The current investigation reveals that mmu_circ_0001022 displays increased expression in BUMPT cells(Boston University Mouse Proximal Tubular Epithelial cell line)and C57BL/6 mouse kidneys following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Experimental analyses indicate that mmu_circ_0001022 diminishes LPS-triggered apoptosis in BUMPT cells. The molecular mechanism involves sequestering miRNA-92a-2-5p, subsequently enhancing SKI expression. Enhanced mmu_circ_0001022 expression reduces CLP-initiated acute kidney injury (AKI) progression through the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Research demonstrates that hsa_ circ_0056869, the mmu_circ_0001022 homologous form, reduces LPS-initiated apoptosis in HK-2 cells (Human Kidney 2 cell line) via the miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway. Notably, septic patients experiencing AKI demonstrated elevated hsa_circ_0056869 plasma concentrations versus non-AKI cases. Analysis revealed hsa_circ_0056869 exhibited 79.41 % sensitivity, 82.35 % specificity, and 0.8175 area under the curve. A marked positive association emerged between hsa_circ_0056869 plasma levels and serum creatinine in septic individuals (r = 0.786). These findings establish the mmu_circ_0001022/hsa_circ_0056869-miRNA-92a-2-5p/SKI pathway as significant in SA-AKI pathogenesis. In addition, our data indicate that hsa_circ_0056869 may serve as an early diagnosis marker for the septic AKI."
41465881,Longitudinal Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Trajectories in Preterm Infants with Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: A Pilot Study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS), defined as systemic infection occurring within the first 72 hours of life, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Increasing evidence indicates that the gut may play an active role in systemic inflammation, yet the temporal behavior of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during EONS has not been characterized. SCFAs and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are key microbial metabolites involved in epithelial maturation and immune regulation and may provide a non-invasive window into early inflammatory vulnerability. METHODS: This pilot prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolled 49 preterm infants (</=32 weeks' gestation) originally identified as at high risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and subsequently stratified into EONS and non-sepsis groups. Serial stool samples were collected at predefined timepoints (TPs; TP1  approximately  3 days of life [DoL], TP2  approximately  7 DoL, TP3  approximately  14 DoL, TP4  approximately  21 DoL, and TP5  approximately  28 DoL). Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify a panel of 12 SCFAs, including BCFAs and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Both absolute concentrations and relative fractions were evaluated, with emphasis on ratio-based metrics (e.g., acetic/propionic acid ratio) and timepoint-specific group contrasts, complemented by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: At the earliest sampling window (TP1), infants with EONS exhibited distinct early changes in SCFA composition, including a significantly lower median relative fraction of acetic acid (86.6% vs. 94.5% in non-sepsis), while several non-acetate components-including propionic, valeric, and branched-chain acids-were relatively enriched. Acetate-to-non-acetate ratios were markedly reduced in EONS (e.g., acetic/propionic and acetic/isobutyric ratios), indicating an early shift away from acetate dominance. PLS-DA at TP1 demonstrated partial separation between groups, with acetic-acid depletion and non-acetate enrichment among the strongest contributors to discrimination. By later TPs, these early differences narrowed to a small subset of BCFA-related ratios and largely attenuated by the end of the first month. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot cohort of preterm infants, EONS was associated with early, structured alterations in fecal SCFA profiles, characterized by reduced acetic-acid dominance and relative enrichment of non-acetate acids. Dynamic, ratio-based assessment proved more informative than absolute concentrations alone, revealing transient intestinal metabolic signatures accompanying systemic infection. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence of gut metabolic involvement in EONS and lay the groundwork for larger, multi-center studies integrating SCFA trajectories with microbiome and immune profiling to refine early risk stratification for systemic infection in high-risk neonatal populations."
25497304,A district general hospital experience of palliative biliary stenting.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Palliative management of malignant pancreaticobiliary (PB) disease typically takes the form of endoscopic biliary stenting with a covered metal stent. We set out to assess outcomes from endoscopic biliary stenting (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, ERCP) for malignant disease in our district general hospital (DGH). METHODS: We identified patients with malignant PB disease who underwent primary ERCP between 2011 and 2012. Case notes were reviewed for clinical outcomes and involvement of palliative care. RESULTS: 38 patients underwent biliary stenting in this period. Median age was 75.6 years (53.6-99.8 years). 35 stents were placed for primary PB malignancy. 31 of these stents were covered metal stents and 6 were uncovered. Bilirubin decreased from a median of 218 to 112 micromol/L (median decrease 55 micromol/L). Complications occurred in the following 13 cases: 7 blocked stents (18.9%), 2 of which were associated with sepsis; 2 cases of stent migration (8.1%); 3 cases of biliary sepsis (8.1%) and 1 episode of pancreatitis (2.7%). Subsequently, 12 patients underwent a single repeat ERCP and 1 patient underwent 3 further ERCPs. Median survival following ERCP and stent was 78 days (10-806). 28 patients (76%) were known to the hospital palliative care team. CONCLUSIONS: Our DGH provides local service with complication rates comparable to those described in the literature. This allows care of patients with limited prognosis to be treated close to home. The majority of stent complications and mortality occur within 3 months. Input from the palliative care team is useful when considering whether a patient has a prognosis long enough to benefit from the procedure."
25672674,Year in review 2013: Critical Care--respiratory infections.,2014,"Infectious complications, particularly in the respiratory tract of critically ill patients, are related to increased mortality. Severe infection is part of a multiple system illness and female patients with severe sepsis have a worse prognosis compared to males. Kallistatin is a protective hormokine released during monocyte activation and low levels in the setting of septic shock can predict adverse outcomes. Presepsin is another biomarker that was recently evaluated and is elevated in patients with severe sepsis patients at risk of dying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has introduced new definitions for identifying patients at risk of ventilator-associated complications (VACs), but several other conditions, such as pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may cause VACs, and not all patients with VACs may have ventilator-associated pneumonia. New studies have suggested strategies to identify patients at risk for resistant pathogen infection and therapies that optimize efficacy, without the overuse of broad-spectrum therapy in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Innovative strategies using optimized dosing of antimicrobials, maximizing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in critically ill patients, and newer routes of drug delivery are being explored to combat drug-resistant pathogens. We summarize the major clinical studies on respiratory infections in critically ill patients published in 2013."
41444326,Whole transcriptome analysis reveals T cell signaling activation in septic patients with thrombocytopenia.,2025,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by a dysregulated immune response to infection, remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Thrombocytopenia, a common sepsis complication, is linked to poor outcomes and reflects disease severity and specific immunological changes affecting patient outcomes. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic differences between septic patients with and without thrombocytopenia and to explore immune features related to clinical outcomes using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We conducted a prospective study on 52 patients who were admitted to ICU for sepsis, including 22 with thrombocytopenia and 30 without. Blood samples were collected on both day 1 and 8, and RNA-Seq was performed to analyze transcriptomic profiles. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to explore biological pathways and processes. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity was assessed using MiXCR and VDJTools software. Thrombocytopenic critically ill septic patients exhibited significantly higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and mortality rates compared to non-thrombocytopenic patients. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles between the two groups, with marked upregulation of myeloproliferative and T-cell activation signaling pathways in thrombocytopenic patients on day 1. Additionally, TCR diversity counts showed no statistically significant differences between thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic patients at day 1 or day 8. Thrombocytopenia in septic ICU patients is associated with altered heme/porphyrin metabolism, erythrocyte development, and immune activation. Lower TCR diversity on day 1 in thrombocytopenic patients suggests early immune repertoire perturbations; however, these findings should be interpreted cautiously and validated with targeted immune repertoire sequencing."
25632745,[Effect of Tongfu Jinghua Decoction on hemodynamics and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients with post-traumatic sepsis shock].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Tongfu Jinghua Decoction (TJD) on hemodynamics and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients with post-traumatic sepsis shock. METHODS: Totally 60 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 30 in each group. Patients in the treatment group took TJD or were administered with TJD by nasal feeding in combined with conventional Western medical treatment, while patients in the control group only received conventional Western medical treatment. Changes of each index in hemodynamics and tissue oxygen metabolism were observed before treatment, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment in the same group, hemodynamic changes were significantly improved at each time point in the two groups. All indices of tissue oxygen metabolism at each time point of the two groups were significantly improved, except changes of O2 extraction ratio (ER) after treatment in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the control group in the same period, heart rate (HR), systemic vascular resist- ance (SVR), and cardiac output (CO) were significantly improved with statistical difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and cardiac index (CI) were significantly improved at 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment with statistical difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Each index of tissue oxygen metabolism in the treatment group were all improved at each time point with statistical difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: TJD combined with conventional Western medical treatment could quickly improve hemodynamics and tissue oxygen metabolism disorder in patients with septic shock, and its curative effect was superior to that of conventional Western medical treatment alone."
31915467,"The Leukocyte VCS Parameters Compared with Procalcitonin, Interleukin-6, and Soluble Hemoglobin Scavenger Receptor sCD163 for Prediction of Sepsis in Patients with Cirrhosis.",2019,"BACKGROUND: Patients with liver cirrhosis have a high risk of sepsis and a poor prognosis. Recently, a new standard for sepsis (Sepsis-3) has been proposed in the general population. The Coulter Lh 750 hematology analyzer can evaluate mean volume, conductivity, scatter, and distribution width of leukocyte. We tried to use Sepsis-3 criteria to study the diagnostic value of volume, conductivity, and scattering (VCS) parameters in sepsis and infection in patients with liver cirrhosis compared with traditional infection markers (PCT, IL-6, sCDl63). METHODS: A blinded, cohort study was conducted in three different ED populations within three affiliated hospitals. A total of 249 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in the study. According to the ""Sepsis-3"" consensus criteria, clinical history, and laboratory examination, the subjects were divided into sepsis (n = 54), patients with infections (n = 95), and patients without systemic infections (n = 100). The blood samples of the patients were collected at the time of ED admission and were evaluated for the detection of sepsis. RESULTS: The differences of MNV, MNS, MMV, MMS, MLV, NDW, and MDW in the three groups were statistically significant. In the diagnosis of sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis, the sensitivity of combined detection of MMV and MDW was 88.89%; the specificity was 74%. This sensitivity was significantly better than the 83.3% achieved using 0.97 mg/L as the cutoff for sCD163. In the diagnosis of infection in cirrhosis, the sensitivity of combination of MNV and MMS was increased to 86.32%; the specificity was 92%. The sensitivity was the same as that achieved by using 0.31 ng/mL as the cutoff value of PCT, but the specificity increased. CONCLUSION: The leukocyte VCS parameter could be potential parameters for indicating sepsis and infection in patients with liver cirrhosis. The combined detection of MMV and MDW seemed to be helpful for the diagnosis of sepsis in these patients, and the combination of MNV and MMS could better indicate infection for them."
25834506,"Outcome of patients undergoing open heart surgery at the Uganda heart institute, Mulago hospital complex.",2014,"BACKGROUND: Heart disease is a disabling condition and necessary surgical intervention is often lacking in many developing countries. Training of the superspecialties abroad is largely limited to observation with little or no opportunity for hands on experience. An approach in which open heart surgeries are conducted locally by visiting teams enabling skills transfer to the local team and helps build to build capacity has been adopted at the Uganda Heart Institute (UHI). OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the progress of open heart surgery at the UHI and evaluated the postoperative outcomes and challenges faced in conducting open heart surgery in a developing country. METHODS: Medical records of patients undergoing open heart surgery at the UHI from October 2007 to June 2012 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients underwent open heart surgery during the study period. The commonest conditions were: venticular septal defects (VSDs) 34.7% (43/124), Atrial septal defects (ASDs) 34.7% (43/124) and tetralogy of fallot (TOF) in 10.5% (13/124). Non governmental organizations (NGOs) funded 96.8% (120/124) of the operations, and in only 4 patients (3.2%) families paid for the surgeries. There was increasing complexity in cases operated upon from predominantly ASDs and VSDs at the beginning to more complex cases like TOFs and TAPVR. The local team independently operated 19 patients (15.3%). Postoperative morbidity was low with arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction and re-operations being the commonest seen. Post operative sepsis occurred in only 2 cases (1.6%). The overall mortality rate was 3.2. CONCLUSION: Open heart surgery though expensive is feasible in a developing country. With increased direct funding from governments and local charities to support open heart surgeries, more cardiac patients access surgical treatment locally."
41521413,Introduction to the 2024 Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Neutropenic Fever in Patients with Cancer: Principles & Practice of Neutropenic Fever.,2025,"This is the introductory chapter to the 2024 Australasian Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Neutropenic Fever in Patients with Cancer, an update of the Australian consensus guidelines published in 2011. These guidelines reflect the new treatment paradigms for cancer care (such as immunotherapy, bispecific antibodies, oral targeted therapies and CAR T) given the changing risks of neutropenic fever and sepsis, the emerging challenges of antimicrobial resistance and the new models of care for managing neutropenic fever. The scope of these guidelines has been broadened to include paediatrics for the first time. Further, chapters are dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention, and consumer engagement and education. Recognising the longstanding challenges about decision-making in the setting of recurrent or persistent neutropenic fever, a new chapter provides guidance about antimicrobial management and investigations. This current chapter introduces the rationale for these guidelines, defines key terms used, including risk assessment, provides an overview of the key principles suitable for a systems approach to the prevention and management of infections in neutropenic patients with cancer, defines the target audience and scope of each chapter, and helps readers navigate the guidelines. We also outline the approach to guideline development, review and feedback."
15667360,[Performance of the Candida mannan antigen detection in patients with fungemia].,2004,"For several years, the Platelia Candida mannan antigen enzyme immunoassay (Candida EIA) has been commercially available as a diagnostic test for invasive candidosis. We evaluated the Candida EIA with patients with proven fungemia caused by yeasts from which at least one serum sample was available. Fifty-nine patients with 121 serum samples were included in the study. Sixty-one different yeast strains were isolated from positive blood-cultures. The Candida EIA was positive (n = 35) or borderline positive (n = 8) in 43 of 59 patients with fungemia, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 73%. For the different yeast species, the following sensitivities were calculated: Candida albicans 30 of 39 (77%), Candida glabrata 7 of 11 (64%), Candida parapsilosis 1 of 3, Candida tropicalis 2 of 2, Candida kefyr 2 of 2, Candida lipolytica 0 of 1, Candida lusitaniae 1 of 1, Candida krusei 1 borderline positive of 1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 of 1. In six patients the antigen levels over time were evaluable. In three cases the antigen was positive 3-4 days before the day the blood culture was drawn, in one case on the same day, and in two cases 2 and 5 days afterwards. In conclusion, the Candida EIA was suitable for the detection of fungemia due to the major facultatively pathogenic yeast species. The test was positive in about half of the patients before blood cultures became positive. In these cases, it contributed to an early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis."
20016911,The influence of gestational age on the dynamic behavior of other risk factors associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).,2010,"BACKGROUND: Improved survival of preterm neonates has increased the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in many middle-income countries. AIM: This study aimed to verify the main risk factors for the development of ROP according to different gestational age (GA) groups. METHODS: A prospective cohort study including infants weighing < or =1,500 g or GA < or =32 weeks at birth was conducted. The main clinical outcomes were the occurrence of any stage of ROP and severe ROP. The perinatal variables considered for the study were: birth weight; GA; gender; to be small for GA (SGA); weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life; use of oxygen in mechanical ventilation or nasal CPAP; multiple gestations; therapeutic use of surfactant, indomethacin, and erythropoietin; occurrence of sepsis, meningitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and patent ductus arteriosus; need for and volume of blood transfusion; and 10-min Apgar score. The patients were divided into three groups according to GA: (group 1) infants of GA < or =28 weeks at birth (n = 100); (group 2) infants of GA = 29-31 weeks at birth (n = 215); and (group 3) infants of GA > or =32 weeks at birth (n = 152). RESULTS: A total of 467 newborn infants were included. Mean BW and GA in the total cohort were 1,216.5 g (+/-278.3) and 30.3 weeks (+/-2.2), respectively. Gestational age groups were not matched for BW and SGA. Any stage of ROP occurred in 111 patients (23.8%) and 24 (5.1%) patients developed severe ROP. Only BW and volume of blood transfusion were significant factors for the occurrence of any stage of ROP in all groups. In group 1, GA, the twin situation, and use of erythropoietin were statistically significant factors. In group 2, only GA and need for blood transfusion were significant. In group 3, use of oxygen in mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and need for blood transfusion were significant for ROP onset. The logistic regression determined that patients in groups 2 and 3 were less likely to develop ROP than patients in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in groups 1 and 2 developed ROP due to general immaturity, whereas bigger babies, of GA > or =32 weeks, developed ROP because they were ""sicker"" babies with more comorbidities."
15646057,Fungemia in acute leukemia patients: a single institution's experience.,2004,"A retrospective study was conducted in 22 episodes of candidemia in 445 patients with acute leukemia (AL) (incidence 4.9%) observed at our Institution between February 1996 and November 2003 to evaluate the variables related to the onset and outcome of infection. Of 22 patients, 20 (90.9%) had refractory/relapsed AL. C. albicans was responsible for 7/22 of the fungemia cases (32%) and C. non albicans for 15/22 (68%). The median absolute neutrophil count was 0.1 x10(9)/L (range 0.04-0.3) at the time of the candidemia diagnosis. The fungemia responded to antifungal therapy in 15/22 (68.1%) patients; among patients with a positive outcome of the fungemia, in 14/15 (93.3%) the neutrophil count recovered within 7 days after the diagnosis of candidemia (p < 0.05). The mortality rate due to candidemia was 31.9% (1/7: 14.2% and 6/15: 40% in the C. albicans and C. non albicans groups, respectively). In our experience the determinants of a positive outcome of fungemia were infection by the C. albicans species and recovery of the neutrophil count."

41473481,Geographic shift of Japanese spotted fever and diagnostic overshadowing by COVID-19 testing: A genetically confirmed northernmost case.,2025,"Japanese spotted fever (JSF), caused by Rickettsia japonica, typically presents with fever, rash, and eschar. While endemic to western and southern Japan, recent cases have emerged in urban, non-endemic areas. A 49-year-old man developed fever after returning from a work assignment in Yamagata Prefecture, a historically non-endemic region. Despite no respiratory findings, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and was initially treated as COVID-19. His condition deteriorated into multiorgan dysfunction, requiring intensive care. Physical examination revealed a diffuse rash and an eschar on the lower leg. Rickettsial infection was suspected, and intravenous minocycline was initiated. Rickettsia japonica was later confirmed by PCR and serology. This case represents the northernmost genetically confirmed JSF in Japan and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, particularly when COVID-19 test results conflict with clinical findings."
25734123,Isolated facial vein thrombophlebitis: a variant of lemierre syndrome.,2014,Lemierre syndrome is a rare complication of acute tonsillitis. It is caused by the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum and is characterized by bacteremia and septic thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. Dissemination of septic emboli may occur. The diagnosis can be difficult since different organs can be involved. We discuss a case of Lemierre syndrome in a 35-year-old woman with isolated thrombophlebitis of the facial vein and fusobacteria growth in blood culture. This case emphasizes the need for awareness of the condition.
25497775,"Adenosine, lidocaine and Mg2+ improves cardiac and pulmonary function, induces reversible hypotension and exerts anti-inflammatory effects in an endotoxemic porcine model.",2014,"INTRODUCTION: The combination of Adenosine (A), lidocaine (L) and Mg(2+) (M) (ALM) has demonstrated cardioprotective and resuscitative properties in models of cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock. This study evaluates whether ALM also demonstrates organ protective properties in an endotoxemic porcine model. METHODS: Pigs (37 to 42 kg) were randomized into: 1) Control (n = 8) or 2) ALM (n = 8) followed by lipopolysaccharide infusion (1 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ h(-1)) for five hours. ALM treatment consisted of 1) a high dose bolus (A (0.82 mg/kg), L (1.76 mg/kg), M (0.92 mg/kg)), 2) one hour continuous infusion (A (300 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1)), L (600 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1)), M (336 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1))) and three hours at a lower dose (A (240 ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1)), L (480 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1)), M (268 mug ∙ kg(-1) ∙ min(-1))); controls received normal saline. Hemodynamic, cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic and renal functions were evaluated. RESULTS: ALM lowered mean arterial pressure (Mean value during infusion period: ALM: 47 (95% confidence interval (CI): 44 to 50) mmHg versus control: 79 (95% CI: 75 to 85) mmHg, P < 0.0001). After cessation of ALM, mean arterial pressure immediately increased (end of study: ALM: 88 (95% CI: 81 to 96) mmHg versus control: 86 (95% CI: 79 to 94) mmHg, P = 0.72). Whole body oxygen consumption was significantly reduced during ALM infusion (ALM: 205 (95% CI: 192 to 217) ml oxygen/min versus control: 231 (95% CI: 219 to 243) ml oxygen/min, P = 0.016). ALM treatment reduced pulmonary injury evaluated by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (ALM: 388 (95% CI: 349 to 427) versus control: 260 (95% CI: 221 to 299), P = 0.0005). ALM infusion led to an increase in heart rate while preserving preload recruitable stroke work. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower during ALM infusion but reversed after cessation of infusion. ALM reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha peak levels (ALM 7121 (95% CI: 5069 to 10004) pg/ml versus control 11596 (95% CI: 9083 to 14805) pg/ml, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: ALM infusion induces a reversible hypotensive and hypometabolic state, attenuates tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and improves cardiac and pulmonary function, and led to a transient drop in renal function that was reversed after the treatment was stopped."
41406547,Emergent Laparotomy for Blunt Trauma: Operating on Frail Older Adults Goes Beyond the Operating Room.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is prevalent among geriatric patients and is a risk factor for worse outcomes in this population. The aim of this study is to provide setting-specific evidence by comparing outcomes of emergent laparotomy between frail and nonfrail geriatric blunt trauma patients. METHODS: A 5-y (2017-2021) retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program was performed. Older adult (age >/=65 y) blunt trauma patients who underwent emergent laparotomy were included and stratified using the 11-factor modified frailty index into frail (F) and nonfrail (NF) groups. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), and major complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, sepsis, surgical site infection, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounding factors, were performed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1655 geriatric blunt trauma patients who underwent laparotomy (F: 273, NF: 1382). The mean age was 74 (7) y and 66% were male. The median injury severity score was 14 [9-25] and the median time to laparotomy was 112 [52-223] min. There was no significant difference in terms of injury characteristics and time to laparotomy between F and NF groups. On univariate analysis, there was no difference in terms of mortality (P = 0.161), intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.204), and major complications (P = 0.969); however, F group had significantly longer median hospital LOS (F: 10 [5-15] versus NF: 8 [2-14], P = 0.001). On multivariable regression analysis, F group was independently associated with higher odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.665, 95% confidence interval [1.194-2.321], P = 0.003) and longer hospital LOS (beta: +2.131, 95% confidence interval [+0.492 to +3.771], P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults undergoing emergent laparotomy after blunt trauma, frailty identifies patients at increased risk of in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay; incorporating frailty assessment at presentation can guide perioperative counseling and resource planning."
41455529,Fungal false positive in BioFire(R) FilmArray(R) analysis for bloodstream infection.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The BioFire FilmArray(R) system is an automated multiplex PCR tool for detecting pathogens in clinical samples. False positives occasionally occur due to cross-reactivity, contamination, or assay specificity issues. This study investigated false-positive fungal results in FilmArray(R) blood culture identification panel 2 (BCID2) detection system. METHOD: We collected the continuous cases in which bloodstream infection (BSI) was suspected in our institute for 12 months, from April in 2024 to March in 2025. We routinely used Bactec FX culture system (Beckton Dickinson) with BD BACTEC culture bottles. Alongside, we identified fungus using standard culture method and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (biomerieux, VITEK MS PRIME). RESULTS: We evaluated continuous 454 blood culture positive sample. Average blood culture sampling were totally 5357 samples per year (44.3/1000 patients days) of blood cultures during our study period. We collected 28 cases of fungemia among totally recruited 454 samples (6.2 %, 28/454). Accordance of blood culture and FilmArray(R) were 50.0 % (14 samples). We observed eight false positive samples (1.8 %. 8/454) as fungemia out of total 454 samples, in where one false organism was Candida albicans and seven were Candida tropicalis. In the cases of four false Candida tropicalis samples, the FilmArray(R) reported the two fungal combination, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. CONCLUSION: Our investigation revealed a substantial incident of false positive of Candida. The study highlights recurrent false positives of Candida tropicalis, often detected alongside Candida parapsilosis. The main cause of the detection of false positive organism in BCID2 including Candida spp. has been reported as contamination or technical errors. We speculated that our observation could be derived from the non-viable DNA fragments (Candida albicans) contained in the blood culture media and cross-reaction of Candida parapsilosis with Candida tropicalis. We should remember these FilmArray(R) assay limitations linked to non-viable DNA contamination and high reactivity of sensitive PCR analysis. False positive results for Candida spp. in BCID2 assays require careful interpretation with microbiological expertise. Clinical decisions should be guided by the patient's overall context. Further research is necessary to assess the accuracy of fungal BSI. (341/500 words)."
25534733,"Doripenem MICs and ompK36 porin genotypes of sequence type 258, KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae may predict responses to carbapenem-colistin combination therapy among patients with bacteremia.",2015,"Treatment failures of a carbapenem-colistin regimen among patients with bacteremia due to sequence type 258 (ST258), KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae were significantly more likely if both agents were inactive in vitro, as defined by a colistin MIC of >2 mug/ml and the presence of either a major ompK36 porin mutation (guanine and alanine insertions at amino acids 134 and 135 [ins aa 134-135 GD], IS5 promoter insertion [P = 0.007]) or a doripenem MIC of >8 mug/ml (P = 0.01). Major ompK36 mutations among KPC-K. pneumoniae strains are important determinants of carbapenem-colistin responses in vitro and in vivo."
31881381,Impact of Injury Severity on the Inflammatory State and Severe Anemia.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Our goal was to analyze blunt traumatic injury by injury severity score (ISS) and compare with elective hip repair, as a transient injury, and healthy control with the hypothesis that more severe injury would lead to an increase in neuroendocrine activation, systemic inflammation, and worse anemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed at a level 1 trauma center, comparing blunt trauma patients (n = 37), elective hip replacement patients (n = 26), and healthy controls (n = 8). Bone marrow and plasma were assessed for hyperadrenergic state, erythropoiesis, and systemic inflammation. Trauma patient's ISS ranged from 4 to 41 and were broken down into quartiles for analysis. The ISS quartiles were 4-13, 14-20, 21-26, and 27-41. RESULTS: Plasma norepinephrine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and hepcidin increased progressively as ISS increased. Hemoglobin significantly decreased as ISS increased and packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion increased as ISS increased. Elective hip replacement patients had an appropriate increase in the bone marrow expression of erythropoietin and the erythropoietin receptor, which was absent in all trauma patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased neuroendocrine activation, systemic inflammation, and anemia correlated with worsening injury severity, lower age, and increased pRBC transfusions. Elective hip replacement patients have only minimal systemic inflammation with an appropriate bone marrow response to anemia. This study demonstrates a link between injury severity, neuroendocrine activation, systemic inflammation, and the bone marrow response to anemia."
16819069,[Surviving sepsis campaign guidelines.].,2004,"The mortality of severe sepsis is growing due to increased incidense of the syndrome. The speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the initial hours is likely to influence outcome. Thus, eleven organizations of experts have developed guidelines, evidence based as far as possible, for the bedside management of patients, aimed at improving diagnosis and outcome in sepsis. The guidelines are a part of a campaign named ?surviving sepsis campaign?, see www.survivingsepsis.org The present article is aimed at introducing the guidelines to icelandic doctors."
15582510,Comparison of pathology in susceptible A/J and resistant C57BL/6J mice after infection with different sub-strains of Plasmodium chabaudi.,2004,"Susceptible A/J and more resistant C57BL/6J mice were infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi 54X, P.c. chabaudi AS and Plasmodium chabaudi adami 408XZ. As expected, most C57BL/6J mice survived the infections with the different isolates. But in contrast to previous observations, not all A/J mice succumbed to infection: just over 50% of A/J mice survived infections with P.c. chabaudi 54X, while 80% survived P.c. chabaudi AS. The more virulent parasite, P.c. adami 408XZ, was able to kill all A/J mice and 20% of C57BL/6J mice after an intravenous infection with 10(5) pRBC. A detailed study of four parameters of pathology (body weight, body temperature, blood glucose and RBC counts) in both mouse strains after a P.c. adami 408XZ infection showed similar patterns to those previously reported after infection with P.c. chabaudi AS. These data suggest that environmental factors as well as parasite polymorphisms might influence the severity of malaria between susceptible and resistant mice."
31822530,Meningeal rheumatoid nodules in a 55-year-old man presenting with chronic headaches and oculomotor nerve palsy: an uncommon extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis.,2019,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem inflammatory disease which can involve many organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Though not very common, the results can be severely debilitating. The spectrum of the CNS involvement includes meningitis, encephalitis and occasionally rheumatoid nodules. Its presentation is variable, though very rarely it can present as focal neurological deficits. Imaging can be suggestive, but diagnosis usually requires tissue biopsy. Treatment consists of high-dose steroids and immunosuppressants. We describe the case of a 55-year-old male patient with a history of RA presenting with a third nerve palsy and headache who was found to have rheumatoid nodules on biopsy. CNS involvement in RA should be considered in anyone with rheumatoid arthritis who presents with focal neurological deficits, though infections and space-occupying lesions should also be ruled out."
41425588,Immunophenotyping of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy: focus on monocyte subtypes and Immune regulatory molecules.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Septic shock is characterized by dysregulation of the host response to infection Q5 which results in life-threatening organ dysfunction that can be partly attributed to immune alterations and endothelial dysfunction (endotheliopathy). This lethal condition is dynamic, complex, and heterogeneous. AIM: Thus, an exploratory broad phenotypic and functional analysis of circulating immune cells and mediators were carried out to better understand the role of the immune system in a subgroup of septic shock patients with endotheliopathy defined by increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). In this regard, especially the immune status of monocyte subtypes (classical, intermediate, and nonclassical) was investigated for surface thrombomodulin (TM), MHC class II molecules (HLADR, -DQ, and -DP) and immunomodulatory surface receptors (TREM-1, CD137, VISTA, HVEM and BTLA). RESULT AND CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis on a septic shock cohort with endotheliopathy identified distinct immune perturbation patterns that potentially can lead to novel treatment avenues in the management of this life-threatening condition."
18333061,Hepatic resection for benign non-cystic liver lesions.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic resection is indicated for a variety of benign conditions because of persistent symptoms, uncertainty regarding the diagnosis or the risk of malignant transformation. The aim of this study was to assess the indications for and outcome of hepatic resection for benign non-cystic liver lesions in a specialist hepatobiliary unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who had undergone hepatic resection for benign non-cystic hepatic lesions between 1989 and 2001 were identified from a prospective database for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (40 women, 9 men) with a mean age of 43 years (range 21-75 years) underwent resection of non-cystic benign lesions. Indications for operation included suspected liver cell adenoma (n=11), suspicion of malignancy (11), persistent symptoms attributable to the lesion (20) or chronic sepsis (7). The final diagnosis was focal nodular hyperplasia (n=12), haemangioma (12), adenoma (8), sclerosing cholangitis (5), inflammatory pseudotumour (4), intrahepatic cholelithiasis (3), chronic hepatic abscess (3), benign biliary fibrosis (I) and leiomyoma (I). Major anatomical hepatic resections were performed in 44 patients, and 5 patients underwent a segmentectomy or minor atypical resection. Median operating time was 215 min (range 45-450 min) and median blood loss was 875 ml (range 200-4000 ml). Ten patients (20%) required a median blood transfusion of 2 units (range 2-8 units). The median postoperative stay was 10 days (range 4-33 days). There were no deaths, but complications occurred in 15 patients (27%). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic resection can be safely recommended for selected patients with a variety of benign non-cystic hepatic lesions. A small group of patients undergo resection as a result of inability to rule out a malignant process, but the large majority will be operated on because of either their malignant potential or related symptoms."
41601678,Case Report: Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease in severe combined immunodeficiency.,2025,"Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare but fatal blood transfusion complication, with a mortality rate of 90-100%. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening primary immunodeficiency with profound cellular and humoral defects. Patients with SCID are highly susceptible to TA-GVHD. Here, we report a 4-month-old male admitted for sepsis and severe pneumonia, with pustular rash and unhealed exudative Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination site. Laboratory tests showed hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Lymphocyte subset analysis confirmed the presence of T-B+NK immunodeficiency. Mycobacterium bovis complex was detected in blood, while rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was identified in sputum and ascitic fluid. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing identified a novel interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG) nonsense mutation [NM_000206.3: c.865C>T, p.(Arg289Ter)]. To the best of our knowledge, this specific IL2RG mutation has not been previously reported. On the 33rd day of admission, the infant accidentally received non-irradiated leucoreduced red blood cells, then developed typical TA-GVHD manifestations including fever, hepatomegaly, rash and diarrhea, and high-resolution Human Leukocyte Antigen typing confirmed it. The parents chose to terminate treatment on the 69th day of admission, and the patient died after discharge. The dynamic evolution of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests in this patient is described, along with a review of the relevant literature. This report expands the mutational spectrum of IL2RG and reveal the reference value of peripheral blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts for early TA-GVHD identification."
41416546,[Causes and mechanisms of death in abdominal surgery].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the causes and mechanisms of postoperative mortality in abdominal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The primary endpoints were mechanism and cause of death within 30 days after surgery. Mortality-associated factors were examined in Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects. RESULTS: Analysis included 550 patients (335 (60.9%) men and 215 (39.1%) women) who underwent abdominal surgery in level II hospitals; 59 (10.7%) out of 550 patients died within 30 days after surgery. Mean age of patients was 53 years. In respiratory diseases, acute respiratory failure associated with damage to lung parenchyma should be noted. Among cardiovascular diseases, the following mechanisms should be distinguished: distributive (e.g., intestinal ischemia, anastomotic insufficiency, sepsis), hypovolemic (blood loss), obstructive (PE), cardiogenic (acute heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction). The most common causes of death were gastrointestinal perforations (7 patients), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (2 patients), PE (3 patients), and intestinal gangrene (2 patients). Among 59 patients, 6 (10.2%) died within 24 hours, 21 (35.6%) - within the period from 24 hours to 7 days, 12 (20.3%) - within 8-14 days, 20 (33.9%) - later than 14 days after surgery. Forty-seven (79.7%) out of 59 patients died in hospital and 12 (20.3%) patients died outside the hospital. CONCLUSION: Circulatory failure accounts for majority of deaths after abdominal surgery. Differences in time to death highlight the risk of death throughout perioperative period and after discharge. We propose to stratify the causes of death to primary and secondary ones (due to the main disease independent on postoperative outcomes and due to postoperative complication)."
15585684,Increased CD11b-density on circulating phagocytes as an early sign of late-onset sepsis in extremely low-birth-weight infants.,2005,"Late-onset hospital-acquired sepsis is common in extremely low birth-weight (<1000 g) (ELBW) infants. The diagnosis is difficult since, at early stages of sepsis, routine laboratory tests are neither specific nor sensitive. In term infants with sepsis neutrophil surface expression of CD11b/CD18, a beta2-integrin, is significantly increased. Here we studied whether increased CD11b/CD18 density on blood neutrophils and monocytes serves as an early sepsis marker in ELBW infants. Blood samples were obtained from 30 ELBW infants on a daily basis for 3-4 postnatal weeks, and neutrophil and monocyte CD11b/CD18 expression was determined by flow-cytometry. Patients were assigned one of 3 groups: 1) an infected group, comprised of infants who had blood culture-positive sepsis and/or necrotizing enterocolitis, 2) a non-infected group, and 3) a potentially infected group, comprised of infants in whom infection was suspected but could not be confirmed microbiologically. One patient had blood culture contamination and was excluded from the analysis. In the infected group, CD11b expression gradually increased during the three days preceding sampling for blood culture. At the day of sampling, median expression of CD11b in neutrophils and monocytes was higher in the infected group than in the control group. For neutrophils the sensitivity and specificity were 1.00 and 0.56, respectively, and for monocytes, 0.86 and 0.94, respectively. From these data, we conclude that determination of CD11b/CD18 density on neutrophils and monocytes may improve diagnosis of late-onset sepsis in ELBW infants."
15613012,Platelet function in sepsis.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia are common in severe sepsis, but sepsis-related alterations in platelet function are ill-defined. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of sepsis on platelet aggregation, adhesiveness, and growth factor release. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was measured in platelet-rich plasma separated from blood samples collected from 47 critically ill patients with sepsis of recent onset. Expression of platelet adhesion molecules was measured by flow cytometry and the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was measured by ELISA in the supernatant of platelet aggregation. RESULTS: Septic patients had consistently decreased platelet aggregation compared with controls, regardless of the platelet count, thrombin generation, or overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) status. The severity of sepsis correlated to the platelet aggregation defect. Adhesion molecules, receptor expression (CD42a, CD42b, CD36, CD29, PAR-1), and alpha-granule secretion detected by P-selectin expression remained unchanged but the release of growth factors was differentially regulated with increased VEGF and unchanged PDGF after agonist activation even in uncomplicated sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis decreases circulating platelets' hemostatic function, maintains adhesion molecule expression and secretion capability, and modulates growth factor production. These results suggest that sepsis alters the hemostatic function of the platelets and increases VEGF release in a thrombin-independent manner."

15938219,[The assessment of severity of lung injury in sepsis].,2004,"Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute and severe pulmonary dysfunction. It is clinically characterized by dyspnea and tachypnea, progressive hypoxemia (within 12-48 hours), reduction of pulmonary compliance and diffuse bilateral infiltrates seen on pulmonary radiogram. Etiological factors giving rise to development of the syndrome are numerous. The acute lung injury (ALI) is defined as the inflammation syndrome and increased permeability, which is associated with radiological and physiological disorders. Lung injury score (LIS), which is composed of four components, is used for making a distinction between two separate but rather similar syndromes. The study was aimed at the assessment of the severity of the lung injury in patients who had suffered from sepsis of the gynecological origin and its influence on the outcome of the disease. The total of 43 female patients was analyzed. Twenty patients (46.51%) were diagnosed as having ARDS based on the lung injury score, while 23 patients (53.48%) were diagnosed with acute lung injury. In our series, lung injury score ranged from 0.7 to 3.3 in ARDS patients, and lethal outcome ensued in 11 (55%) cases in this group. As for the patients with the acute lung injury, the score values ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 and only one patient from this group died (4.34%). The obtained results indicate that high values of the lung injury score are suggestive of the severe respiratory dysfunction as well as that lethal outcome is dependent on LIS value."
31898561,[Meta-analysis of the diagnostic efficacy of heparin binding protein in adult sepsis].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of heparin binding protein (HBP) in the diagnosis of adult sepsis by meta-analysis. METHODS: The retrospective, randomized controlled and prospective researches on the diagnosis of adult sepsis using HBP were reviewed by searching VIP network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from foundation to August 2018. The researches were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and QUADAS was used to evaluate the quality of eligible studies. Metadisc 14.0 was used to analyze the threshold effect, pool the estimation and do Meta regression analysis. Publication bias was assessed using Stata 12.0 with Deeks funnel plot. RESULTS: A total of 728 related literatures were searched and 14 studies were enrolled in this study with a total of 2 023 subjects, with 1 120 in sepsis group and 903 in non-sepsis control group (795 patients with non-sepsis and 108 healthy volunteers). The total score of literature quality was 14-23, indicating that the overall quality was good. Meta-analysis showed that Spearman correlation coefficient between sensitivity logorithm and 1-specificity logorithm of 14 groups of data was 0.106 (P = 0.719), indicating no threshold effect. The pooled sensitivity was 0.74 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.72-0.77], the pooled specificity was 0.73 (95%CI was 0.70-0.76), the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 14.15 (95%CI was 7.77-25.78), and the area under summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.865. Deeks funnel plot was asymmetrical on the left and right (P = 0.60), indicating that there was no publication bias of the eligible studies. CONCLUSIONS: HBP has good accuracy for the diagnosis of adult sepsis and it can be used as an auxiliary index for adult sepsis diagnosis."

20237447,High prevalence and gender bias in distribution of Plasmodium malariae infection in central east-coast India.,2009,"Light microscopy, the mainstay of malaria diagnosis in epidemiologic studies, exhibits limited sensitivity for detecting low level infections and often under-estimates the frequency of mixed Plasmodium species infections. To overcome these shortcomings we performed the PCR method for detection and identification of Plasmodium species in blood specimens from 242 individuals collected during the peak season of malaria incidence (July-October). Malaria prevalence was 81.4% and 43.4% by PCR and microscopy respectively. Moreover, while PCR detected Plasmodium malariae DNA in 108 (44.6%), microscopic examination detected only 20 (8.3%) individuals parasitized with this species. Further data analysis revealed an independent random distribution pattern of parasites irrespective of age groups (0-5 yrs, chi-square7df=2.77, P>0.95; 6-15 yrs, chi-square7df=4.82, P>0.50; >15 yrs, chi-square7df=4.4, P>0.70) and sexes (for male chi-square7df=2.48, P>0.95; for female, chi-square7df=1.85, P>0.95). However, although the parasite distribution is random irrespective of sex, females had more P. malariae infections (P=0.004, OR=2.312, 95% CI=1.3-4.1). Our study demonstrates that the parasite distribution in Orissa is random with substantially higher prevalence of P.malariae than previously suspected and this may be seasonal. A study of the bionomics of vector(s) responsible for P. malariae transmission in Orissa is needed to provide information for the control of malaria in the state."
41419365,"Development and validation of a pre-trained language model for neonatal morbidities: a retrospective, multicentre, prognostic study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Early identification and monitoring of neonatal morbidities are critical for timely interventions that can prevent complications, optimise resource use, and support families. Although traditional tools based on tabular data and biomarkers are beneficial, they are restricted in assessing the risk of morbidities in newborns. In this study, we developed NeonatalBERT, a pre-trained large language model (LLM) that estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from clinical notes. METHODS: This prognostic study investigated retrospective primary and external cohorts from two different quaternary-care academic medical centres in the USA: Stanford Health Care and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. NeonatalBERT was initially pre-trained on clinical notes from the primary cohort and then fine-tuned separately for both cohorts. NeonatalBERT was also compared against other existing LLMs, such as BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT, as well as traditional machine learning and logistic regression models using tabular features. NeonatalBERT was evaluated on 19 neonatal morbidities (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, atelectasis, aspiration syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal seizures, other CNS disorders, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiovascular instability, sepsis, candidiasis, anaemia, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death) for the primary cohort and ten for the external cohort (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage, intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, jaundice, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and death). For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and F1 scores were evaluated. FINDINGS: 32 321 newborns were included in the primary cohort, including 27 411 in the primary training set (mean gestational age 38.64 weeks [SD 2.30]; 13 056 [47.6%] female and 14 355 [52.4%] male newborns) and 4910 in the primary testing set (mean gestational age 38.64 [2.13] weeks; 2336 [47.6%] female and 2574 [52.4%] male newborns). Additionally, 7061 newborns were selected into the external cohort, including 5653 in the external training set (1567 [27.7%] premature and 4086 [72.3%] term births; 2614 [46.2%] female and 3039 [53.8%] male newborns) and 1408 in the external testing set (383 [27.2%] premature and 1025 [72.8%] term births; 624 [44.3%] female and 784 [55.7%] male newborns). In the primary cohort, the mean AUPRC over 19 outcomes was 0.291 (95% CI 0.268-0.314) for NeonatalBERT, 0.238 (0.217-0.259) for Bio-ClinicalBERT, 0.217 (0.197-0.236) for BioBERT, and 0.194 (0.177-0.211) for the traditional model using tabular data. In the external cohort, NeonatalBERT had a mean AUPRC of 0.360 (0.328-0.393), outperforming other models with the range of 0.224-0.333. INTERPRETATION: Based on validation using two large-scale US datasets, NeonatalBERT effectively estimates the risk of neonatal morbidities from unstructured clinical notes of newborns. The promising results from this study show the potential of NeonatalBERT to enhance neonatal care and streamline hospital operations.

32166258,"Thrombomodulin, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 and Protein C Levels, and Organ Dysfunction in Sepsis.",2019,"Since endothelial function is closely related to organ dysfunction in sepsis and the relationship among endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, and other biomarkers remains unclear, we aimed to evaluate the correlation among endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, and several biomarkers in patients with sepsis. DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational study. SETTING: The study was conducted in a university hospital with 14 mixed ICU beds. PATIENTS: ICU patients with sepsis from June 2011 to December 2017 were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS: Endothelial biomarkers (soluble thrombomodulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein C) and markers of inflammation and coagulation were evaluated during the ICU stay. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were assessed for 7 days after ICU admission to determine organ dysfunction. Variables were compared among five stratified groups according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 13-24). Regression analysis and 95% CIs were used to evaluate trends in biomarkers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into five stratified groups (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 0-2, n = 159 [20.5%]; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 3-5, n = 296 [38.2%]; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 6-8, n = 182 [23.5%]; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 9-12, n = 75 [9.7%]; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 13-24, n = 31 [4.0%]). Protein C activity was significantly correlated with the severity of organ dysfunction. It was lower on day 1, increased upon successful treatment, and was significantly higher in groups with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. CONCLUSIONS: Trends and activity of protein C were superior in predicting organ dysfunction compared with other endothelial biomarkers. Monitoring the level of protein C activity is an ideal tool to monitor organ dysfunctions in patients with sepsis."
31858227,"Immunosuppression, BK polyomavirus infections, and BK polyomavirus-specific T cells after pediatric kidney transplantation.",2020,"BACKGROUND: After kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy increases risk of BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN). Outcomes of BKPyV viremia are various and prognostic markers are missing. The impact of different immunosuppressive regimens on BKPyV infections is currently under discussion. METHODS: We analyzed immunosuppressive therapy and BKPyV-specific cellular immunity to distinguish patients at risk of BKPyVAN from those with self-limiting viremia for purposes of risk-stratified BKPyV management. In a retrospective analysis, 46 pediatric kidney recipients with BKPyV viremia were analyzed with regard to duration of BKPyV viremia and immunosuppressive therapy; in addition, in 37/46 patients, BKPyV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were measured. RESULTS: Nine patients showed persistent BKPyV viremia and BKPyVAN, and required therapeutic intervention, while 37 patients had asymptomatic, self-limiting viremia. At onset of viremia, 78% of patients with persistent viremia and BKPyVAN were treated with tacrolimus, whereas tacrolimus therapy was significantly less frequent in patients with self-limiting viremia (14%). The majority of patients with transient, self-limiting viremia received cyclosporine A (81%) and/or mTOR inhibitors (81%). Patients with persistent BKPyV viremia and BKPyVAN showed lack of BKPyV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells (6/6), whereas the majority of patients with self-limiting viremia (27/31) had detectable BKPyV-specific CD4 and/or CD8 T cells >/= 0.5 cells/mul (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that tacrolimus enhances risk of BKPyVAN with need of therapeutic intervention, whereas under cyclosporine A and mTOR inhibitors, the majority of pediatric kidney recipients showed self-limiting viremia. In patients at risk of BKPyV infections, combination of cyclosporine A and mTOR inhibitor may be advantageous."
41403607,Causal associations of circulating inflammatory proteins with sepsis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis arises from dysregulated inflammation in response to infection, precipitating organ dysfunction. Circulating inflammatory mediators likely contribute to sepsis pathogenesis, but their precise roles remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate potential causal impacts of inflammatory proteins on sepsis risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization study evaluating causal associations for 91 inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. Genetic instruments were derived from a published genome-wide association study of plasma proteins. Sepsis outcome data were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen cohort. Inverse-variance weighted analysis was conducted along with several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The analyses identified significant causal associations for several inflammatory proteins with sepsis risk. TRAIL exhibited a causal effect on increased overall sepsis risk (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17). CCL28 showed a causal link to higher 28-day sepsis mortality in critical care (OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.18-9.29). CCL4 demonstrated a causal association with increased 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06-1.31). Meanwhile, beta-NGF was found to be causally protective for sepsis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99), and TNFB also showed a causally protective effect (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates roles of inflammatory mediators in sepsis pathogenesis. The identified proteins may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. TRAIL signaling inhibition may hold promise for future clinical translation given its causal links to increased sepsis risk and mortality. CCL28 and CCL4 also represent potential immunological drivers of sepsis mortality worthy of further investigation. Meanwhile, the neurotrophins beta-NGF and TNFB emerged as having protective effects in sepsis that could be therapeutically augmented. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm the observed causal relationships. Our findings provide targets for future mechanistic and clinical examination to impact patient prognosis."
15847354,Epidemic of leptospirosis: an ICU experience.,2004,"AIMS: To study the clinical profile and outcome of critically ill patients suffering from leptospirosis with organ dysfunction and correlate mortality with individual risk factors. METHODS: A study of critically ill patients suffering from leptospirosis was carried out in the Medical Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary centre of a metropolitan city between 1st June 2002 and 31st May 2003. All the patients in whom diagnosis was confirmed by ELISA IgM antibody testing underwent thorough clinical examination and necessary biochemical investigations. They received standard antimicrobial therapy and extensive supportive therapy as required. Mortality was correlated with individual risk factors. RESULTS: Out of 834 total admissions in this period, 60 (7.2%) patients suffered from leptospirosis. There were 48 males and 12 females with age ranging from 12 to 60 years, mean age being 40 years. The clinical manifestations varied from fever (58 patients), jaundice (38), subconjunctival haemorrhages (24), to altered sensorium (22). All the patients had evidence of severe sepsis. Forty six patients had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and 26 required ventilatory support. The total mortality in leptospirosis patients was 52% which was much higher compared to the total MICU mortality (31.4%) in the same period. CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is an important infection associated with high mortality when associated with organ dysfunction. The poor prognostic factors are preponderance of male sex, alcohol dependence, age group > 50 years, MODS, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), presence of acidosis and need for mechanical ventilation. However, timelyintervention and intensive therapy can save many young lives."
19941686,Epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with haematological malignancies with and without neutropenia.,2010,"All bacterial isolates from 7058 patients admitted to haemato-oncology wards at National Taiwan University Hospital between 2002 and 2006 were characterized. In total 1307 non-duplicate bloodstream isolates were made from all patients with haematological malignancy; 853 (65%) of these were from neutropenic patients. Gram-negative bacteria predominated (60%) in neutropenic isolates with Escherichia coli (12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (6%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6%) the most frequent. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the most common Gram-positive pathogens. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 50% of E. coli and 20% of K. pneumoniae isolates from neutropenic patients. Extensively drug-resistant A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were also found during the study period. Emerging antimicrobial resistant pathogens are an increasing threat to neutropenic cancer patients."
15684801,Devastating presentations of regional enteritis (Crohn's disease): two reports of survival following severe multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Regional enteritis may present in the setting of a variety of clinical symptoms. These symptoms range from mild to severe. METHODS: Here we describe two different presentations of regional enteritis (Crohn's disease): one in the setting of Clostridium perfringens sepsis and the second in association with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Both presentations resulted in life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. RESULTS: Following appropriate surgical management and intensive physiologic support, both patients recovered, despite a MODS-predicted risk of mortality of 100% and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant presentations of regional enteritis of this magnitude are rare, and highlight the resolution of severe multiple organ dysfunction for each presentation."
41466195,Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) as a predictor of multiple organ dysfunction in pediatric critical care: a retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: RBC distribution width is a key variable in complete blood counts, associated with immature RBC release into circulation due to various processes, including systemic inflammation. RDW correlates with elevated acute inflammatory markers like ESR, CRP, and interleukin-6, and is a biomarker in conditions like kidney disease and multiple myelomas. It independently predicts disease severity in critically ill adults and is associated with morbidity, mortality and length of stay in pediatric intensive care unit, though its potential as an early biomarker for detecting pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) remains unknown. METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed PICU patients admitted to Aga Khan University Hospital from September 2018 to December 2022, excluding those admitted for less than 48 h for elective procedures, received recent RBC transfusions, or were anemic. RDW > 14.0% was considered elevated. MODS, defined as dysfunction in two or more organs, was the primary outcome. Data included demographics, PRISM III scores, laboratory values (RDW, BUN, creatinine, CRP, etc.), and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified into three RDW groups: <13.4%, 13.4-14.3%, and > 14.4%. Analysis focused on associations between RDW levels and MODS within the first 7 days of PICU admission. RESULTS: The study included 680 patients. Higher RDW was associated with younger age and higher PRISM III scores, but not with sex. RDW Group III had longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and higher incidence of MODS, but not significant. Hemoglobin and MCHC levels were lower in Group III, whereas BUN and creatinine levels showed no significant differences across groups. The OR for MODS was highest for Group II. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study evaluated the prognostic value of RDW in predicting length of stay, mortality, and early identification of MODS within seven days. Among 680 pediatric patients, higher RDW levels were associated with increased mortality, longer LOS, and higher rates of sepsis and MODS, though these findings lacked statistical significance. Elevated RDW was linked to inflammation and critical illness severity but did not correlate well with pediatric severity scores or MODS trends. Future multicenter studies are recommended to explore RDW's utility in predicting early organ dysfunction and critical illness outcomes."
31926500,Study of MicroRNA-122 as a Diagnostic Biomarker of Sepsis.,2019,"Sepsis in intensive care units (ICUs) represent a threat with need for rapid and accurate diagnosis. We aimed to assess miR-122 as an early biomarker for diagnosis and outcome prediction in patients with hospital acquired sepsis in ICU. This case control study included 25 adults' patients with sepsis and 25 patients with local wound infections as a control group. C-reactive protein (CRP), total leucocytes count (TLC), liver function, and molecular determination of miR-122 levels were assessed. miR-122 had significant higher area under curve (AUC) when compared with CRP and TLC for differentiation of sepsis from wound infections. The cut off value for miR-122 was 0.16 folds expression with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy 100%. The TLC cut off value was 14.00 x103/cmm with 100% sensitivity, 84% specificity and 92% accuracy. While CRP cut off value was 41 mg/l with 76.0% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 88.0% accuracy. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed non statistically significant difference between survivors and non survivors regarding sepsis biomarkers. Receiver operation curve (ROC) for different biomarkers, CRP, TLC and miR-122 to differentiate patients with poor outcome of sepsis compared to patients with recovery, revealed that AUC was 0.61, 0.6, and 0.45 respectively. miR-122 as a prognostic biomarker for sepsis had 66.6% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 56.0% accuracy. The present study highlights important points in the use of biomarkers in diagnosis of sepsis in adults' patients above 50 years old. miR-122 is an accurate and specific biomarker for diagnosis of sepsis. miR-122 has limited predictive value for determination of the outcome of patients with sepsis even when used in combination with another biomarker such as CRP and TLC."
20022196,Lewis lead enhances atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia.,2012,"BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of wide QRS tachycardia is a challenge for the emergency physician. The major tool is the electrocardiogram (ECG), even though the sensitivity and specificity may be variable, depending on presentation. Additional leads could be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG. OBJECTIVE: To document the use of the Lewis lead in improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG in wide QRS tachycardia. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, in treatment with methotrexate, was admitted with progressive dyspnea that evolved to acute respiratory distress and shock at arrival. Pneumonia was diagnosed as the infection and she received antibiotics, and respiratory and inotropic support. She was also using amiodarone for more than 10 years, but she couldn't state the reason. On cardiac monitoring, wide QRS tachycardia was detected and ventricular tachycardia was considered on the differential diagnosis. The standard 12-lead ECG was complemented with the Lewis lead, obtained with higher speed and amplitude, demonstrating atrioventricular concordance and excluding ventricular tachycardia. The patient was treated for septic shock, and she died 2 days later. CONCLUSION: The Lewis lead is a simple and easy strategy to enhance atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia."
15596304,[Totally implantable venous access ports: frequency of complications and analysis of bacterial contamination after ablation].,2004,"Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAP) are valuable medical devices for long-term intravenous treatment such as parenteral nutrition, cancer chemotherapy or antiviral therapy. Implantation and use of these devices are each associated with infectious or mechanical complications. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To determine the frequency of complications and to analyze bacterial contamination of different parts of TIVAP (tip, septum, internal lumen of the port). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical charts of patients, which TIVAP was removed between April 20th to December 31st 2003, were retrospectively reviewed. Infectious complications (local and septicemic) and non-infectious complications (i.e. obstruction, thrombosis, drug extravasation...) were defined using clinical and/or microbiological criteria. Quantitative culture from different parts of the TIVAP was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and ten patients (age 57 +/- 14-years-old, 94.3% cancers) were included, corresponding to 57,018 catheter-days: 39.1% had one or more non-infectious complications (density incidence: 0.86 for 1000 catheter-days). Among the 49 complications, obstruction, thrombosis, extravasations and malposition accounted for 30.6%, 30.6% 4.1% and 6% of cases. Twenty-one patients (19.1%) had an infectious complication: 11 were local and 14 were systemic (density incidence 0.43 for 1000 catheter-days). Bacteria responsible for TIVAP-associated bacteraemia were coagulase negative staphylococci (N = 2), Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to methicilline (N = 3), micrococci (N = 1), corynebacteria (N = 1) or Gram-negative bacilli (N = 8). Comparison of quantitative culture of the different parts of TIVAP with a threshold at 10(3) CFU/ml showed that culture of tip, septum and port has a sensitivity of 47.6% 57.1% and 61.9 %, respectively and a specificity of 100% 92.1% and 92.1%, respectively for the diagnosis of TIVAP infection. CONCLUSION: Complications associated to TIVAP are frequent but incidence that we have reported is comparable with previous studies. Analysis of internal lumen of the port is the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of TIVAP-associated infections."
25684851,Muscle atrophy in intensive care unit patients.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: The muscle atrophy is one of the most important and frequent problems observed in patients in Intensive Care Units. The term describes the disorder in the structure and in the function of the muscle while incidence rates range from 25-90 % in patients with prolonged hospitalization. PURPOSE: This is a review containing all data related to the issue of muscle atrophy and is especially referred to its causes and risk factors. The importance of early diagnosis and early mobilization are also highlighted in the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a literature review was performed on valid databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Cinhal for the period 2000-2013 in English language. The following keywords were used: loss of muscle mass, ICU patients, immobilization, bed rest. RESULTS: From the review is concluded that bed rest and immobilization in order to reduce total energy costs, are the main causes for the appearance of the problem. The results of the reduction of the muscle mass mainly affect the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory system. The administration of the cortisone, the immobility, the sepsis and hyperglycemia are included in the risk factors. The prevention is the primary therapeutic agent and this is achieved due to the early mobilization of the patients, the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation and the avoidance of exposure to risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention of muscle atrophy is a primary goal of treatment for the patients in the ICU, because it reduces the incidence of the disease, reduces the time spent in ICU and finally improves the quality of patients' life."
25720567,A Case of Hepatic Portal Venous Gas in a Patient Treated with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin for Lung Cancer.,2014,"Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) has rarely been reported in patients undergoing chemotherapy. We encountered a case of a 64-year-old man with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma who received adjuvant chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin and developed HPVG 1 day after the second chemotherapy. An emergency operation was performed, but the patient died 2 days after the operation because of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis. Since the patient had complained of alternating abdominal bloating and diarrhea during chemotherapy, we considered that the cause of HPVG was intestinal mucosal disruption and increased intraluminal pressure due to the chemotherapy."
31983763,Impact of the Sequence of Norepinephrine and Vasopressin Discontinuation in Patients Recovering From Septic Shock.,2020,"Background: Septic shock is a serious medical condition affecting millions of people each year and guidelines direct vasopressor use in these patients. However, there is little information as to which vasopressor should be discontinued first. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the sequence of norepinephrine and vasopressin discontinuation on intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted at The University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. Patients included in this study were adults 18 years of age and older with a diagnosis of septic shock who received norepinephrine in combination with vasopressin. Patients were excluded if norepinephrine or vasopressin were not the last 2 vasoactive agents used or if the patient expired or care was withdrawn. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 86 patients were included in this study, with 34 patients in the norepinephrine discontinued first group (NDF) and 52 in the vasopressin discontinued first group (VDF). For the primary outcome of ICU length of stay, no statistically significant difference was found between the NDF and the VDF groups (9.38 days vs 11.07 days, P = .313). The secondary outcome of the dose of norepinephrine at which vasopressin was initiated was also found to not be significant between the NDF and VDF groups (22 microg/min vs 31.1 microg/min, P = .11). The rates of hypotension within 24 hours of discontinuation of the first agent were also not significant between the NDF and VDF groups (17% vs 31%, P = .38). Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, there was significant no difference in ICU length of stay based on the sequence of discontinuation between norepinephrine and vasopressin in patients recovering from septic shock."
31888581,Antimicrobial resistance of bacteraemia in the emergency department of a German university hospital (2013-2018): potential carbapenem-sparing empiric treatment options in light of the new EUCAST recommendations.,2019,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated predominant microorganisms causing community-onset bacteraemia at the medical emergency department (ED) of a tertiary-care university hospital in Germany from 2013 to 2018 and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. METHODS: Antimicrobial resistance patterns in patients with positive blood cultures presenting to an internal medicine ED were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Blood cultures were obtained at 5191 of 66,879 ED encounters, with 1013 (19.5%) positive results, and true positive results at 740 encounters (diagnostic yield, 14.3%). The most frequently isolated relevant microorganisms were Enterobacterales (n = 439, 59.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 92, 12.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 34, 4.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 32, 4.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 16, 2.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 18, 2.4%), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 12, 1.6%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a high proportion of resistance against ampicillin-sulbactam in Enterobacterales (42.2%). The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was low (0.4%). Piperacillin-tazobactam therapy provided coverage for 83.2% of all relevant pathogens using conventional breakpoints. Application of the new European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommendations increased the percentage of susceptible isolates to high-dose piperacillin-tazobactam to 92.8% (p < 0.001). Broad-spectrum carbapenems would only cover an additional 4.8%. The addition of vancomycin or linezolid extended coverage by just 1.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Using an ureidopenicillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination at the high dose suggested by the new EUCAST recommendations provided nearly 93% coverage for relevant pathogens in patients with suspected bloodstream infection in our cohort. This might offer a safe option to reduce the empiric use of carbapenems. Our data support the absence of a general need for glycopeptides or oxazolidinones in empiric treatment."
41420709,Acute kidney injury in extremely preterm infants: findings from an Australian single-centre retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in infants born extremely preterm (EPT, < 28 weeks' gestation). Neonatal AKI is independently associated with increased mortality and is likely to be associated with kidney dysfunction later in life. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of AKI in EPT infants in a single tertiary neonatal centre. METHODS: Retrospective study of EPT infants admitted to a tertiary neonatal centre in Australia between August 2020 and December 2022. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition (including creatinine and oliguria criteria). Comparisons between AKI and non-AKI cohorts used linear, logistic, or quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 204 infants admitted during the study period, 193 were included in the study (11 excluded due to death or medical transfer within 48 h after birth). Sixty infants (31%) had an episode of AKI during their inpatient admission: 31 (51.7%) had AKI stage 1, 11 (18.3%) had stage 2, and 18 (30%) had stage 3. Among these, 27 (45%) were recognised by the treating team, 18 (30%) had the diagnosis documented on their discharge summary, and three (5%) were referred for nephrology follow-up. Compared with the non-AKI cohort, infants with AKI were of lower gestational age and lower birth weight and had greater exposure to nephrotoxic medication. Infants with AKI had more episodes of sepsis, more days on respiratory support, and more days admitted to a tertiary centre than those without AKI. CONCLUSIONS: AKI in EPT infants is common and associates with multiple comorbidities and treatments in the NICU. These data highlight risk factors on which AKI screening and stewardship programmes can be focused."
25495779,Daptomycin versus linezolid for treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Linezolid, which has bacteriostatic activity, is approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. Meanwhile, daptomycin exerts bactericidal activity against VRE, but is not approved for the treatment of VRE bacteremia. Only a few studies with small sample sizes have compared the effectiveness of these drugs for treatment of VRE bacteremia. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies of VRE bacteremia treatment published before January 1, 2014. All studies reporting daptomycin and linezolid treatment outcomes simultaneously were included. The endpoints were mortality and microbiological cure. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of mortality in daptomycin- and linezolid-treated patients were extracted if available. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (532 patients receiving daptomycin, 656 patients receiving linezolid) met the selection criteria. All studies had retrospective cohort designs and relatively small sample sizes. Eight studies compared the aORs of mortality in daptomycin- and linezolid-treated patients. Four studies were published as conference papers and there was significant heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 63%, p = 0.04). Daptomycin use was not associated with better microbiological cure (daptomycin vs. linezolid, OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.42-1.06, p = 0.09). However, mortality was higher in patients receiving daptomycin (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09-1.86, p = 0.009). Subgroup analysis of studies that reported aORs indicated that daptomycin was associated with higher mortality (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.50, p = 0.04). There was no evidence of publication bias, but all enrolled studies were retrospective, had small sample sizes, and had substantial limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited data is available, the current meta-analysis shows that linezolid treatment for VRE bacteremia was associated with a lower mortality than daptomycin treatment. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously because of limitations inherent to retrospective studies and the high heterogeneity among studies. A large randomized trial is needed to confirm the present results."
32476695,Candida auris infection in the central catheter of a patient without sepsis symptoms.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging yeast frequently reported as resistant to multiple antifungal drugs commonly used to treat Candida infections. This specie can colonize the patient's skin and has great ability for producing outbreaks in hospitals. C. auris is phylogenetically related to other Candida species, can be misidentified using conventional biochemical or commercial methods and requires specific technology for its identification. CASE REPORT: We report the first isolate of C. auris in Cali, Colombia, from a central venous catheter in a 37-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis and endocarditis who did not have symptoms of sepsis. The yeast was initially misidentified as C. haemulonii using the Phoenix system and subsequently identified as C. auris by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration; the isolate was susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: This report contributes to knowledge of the epidemiology of C. auris infections in individuals with underlying disease and describes an isolate with a behavior different from what is usually reported."
31846994,Necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis caused by Aeromonas hydrophila.,2019,"Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) occasionally causes necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and sepsis in immunocompromised hosts. NF is associated with high mortality. In cases of septic shock due to A. hydrophila, mortality is nearly 100%. Our 47-year-old male patient was diagnosed with NF and septic shock due to A. hydrophila. He had not been exposed to fresh or slightly salty water, which is where the bacterium is typically found, so its origin in this case is unclear. This is the first known case in which the patient was able to be completely cured without amputation. NF was suspected from his sepsis, medical history including alcoholic cirrhosis, and a severely poor general condition, but his skin lesions were mild. We promptly made an exploratory incision and debrided his legs. NF could then be diagnosed. At an early stage, A. hydrophila was recognized as a possible pathogen of NF because of the patient's medical background and the Gram stain findings of intraoperative exudate. Minocycline in addition to carbapenem and vancomycin plus clindamycin were administered as empiric therapy. When A. hydrophila was detected in the blood culture, ciprofloxacin was administered as definitive therapy. Successful treatment of NF requires early diagnosis, prompt debridement from onset and adequate empirical antibiotic therapy."
20011827,Experimental splenectomies and malaria in mice.,2009,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the importance of spleen in malaric infection in murino model, comparing the parasitemia and the titles of immunoglobulins in the different groups. METHODS: It was used female mice non-isogenic, inoculated with Plasmodium berghei, cepa ANKA, intraperitoneally. The parasitemia was analyzed in 23rd, 25th, 27th and 32nd day of the experiment, being the stained blood exam colored by Giemsa. The titles of the total serum immunoglobulins IgM and IgG were analyzed by Dot-ELISA technique, at 6th, 22nd and 32nd day, when the animals were sacrificed. RESULTS: The parasitemia was gradual in all the inoculated groups. In the end of the experiment, the animals with partial parasitemia present superior parasitemia, but next to the non-splenectomized, while the asplenics present difference bigger than the double. The levels of total serum IgM and IgG didn't have significant changes with the removal partial or total splenic. CONCLUSION: The techniques conservatives in splenic trauma are possible and necessary. The importance of remaining spleen in the clearance of red blood cells parasitized by Plasmodium berghei showed being efficient, in order to avoid serious complications resulting of the malaria in mice."
15590807,Success and short-term complication rates of percutaneous nephrostomy during pregnancy.,2004,"Outcome of percutaneous nephrostomy creation during pregnancy was retrospectively studied. Catheter insertion was successful in all cases (N = 8; 3% of all nephrostomies over a 5-year period), with one major complication (sepsis) and three minor complications. Catheters remained in situ for a mean of 9.4 days until the stone passed (n = 1) or was removed on ureteroscopy (n = 2) or a ureteral stent was inserted (n = 5). Maternal outcome was normal in all cases, but there were two premature deliveries. Nephrostomy during pregnancy has acceptable technical and clinical results, but the possibility of an increased risk of septic complications (12.5% in this series) necessitates further study."
15590425,Undesired effects of steroids during pregnancy.,2004,"Antenatal corticosteroid administration for enhancing fetal lung maturity can be expected to induce negative maternal and fetal side-effects. Maternal short-term effects after multiple courses of corticosteroids are an increase of infections and a higher incidence of endometritis and chorionamnionitis in patients with premature rupture of membranes. A single dose of corticosteroid induces an increase in the count of maternal white blood cells and metabolic effects such as the augmentation of amino acid concentration and of fasting glucose levels in maternal plasma. Negative fetal effects of antenatal corticosteroids are a reduction of fetal body and breathing movements and a reduction of fetal heart rate variation, without any changes in Doppler waveform patterns of fetoplacental vessels. It has been suggested that a multiple course of corticosteroids antenatally might induce negative effects on fetal intrauterine growth and on neonatal birth weight. In addition, multiple courses are associated with an increased risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis."
31895029,A Multi Center Experience: Is Valve Replacement Safe for Patients with Hugely Dilated Left Ventricle?,2019,"BACKGROUND: Dilated left ventricle occurs in chronic aortic and mitral regurgitations. We describe the early outcome of mitral and aortic valve replacement for patients with severely dilated left ventricle in different surgical interventions. METHODS: From March 2014 to December 2018, 620 patients with left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) of >/= 70 mm underwent valve replacement procedures in 8 cardiac surgery centers in Egypt. One hundred ninety four cases (31.3%) underwent aortic valve replacement, 173 cases (27.9%) underwent mitral valve replacement, 123 cases (19.9%) underwent double valve replacement, 59 cases (9.5%) underwent double valve replacement with either tricuspid valve repair or replacement, 33 cases (5.3%) underwent mitral valve replacement with either tricuspid valve repair or replacement, 20 cases (3.2%) underwent mitral valve replacement with CABG, 10 cases (1.6%) underwent aortic valve replacement with CABG, while 8 cases (1.3%) underwent aortic valve replacement with ascending aortic aneurysm repair. RESULTS: Four patients (0.6%) developed new postoperative renal failure, which required dialysis. Twenty-nine patients (4.7%) required reoperation for bleeding. One patient (0.2 %) developed sternal dehiscence. Five patients (0.8%) postoperatively developed stroke. Twenty-five patients (4%) died, and the main causes of death were low cardiac output and sepsis with eventual multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: Valve replacement in patients with hugely dilated left ventricle are safe operations with satisfactory outcomes even if combined with other procedures, especially with proper preoperative preparation, intraoperative preservation of posterior mitral leaflet, and meticulous postoperative follow up in the surgical ICU."
15663852,Alligators as West Nile virus amplifiers.,2004,"Recent evidence suggests that American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) may be capable of transmitting West Nile virus (WNV) to other alligators. We experimentally exposed 24 juvenile alligators to WNV parenterally or orally. All became infected, and all but three sustained viremia titers >5.0 log10 PFU/mL (a threshold considered infectious for Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes) for 1 to 8 days. Noninoculated tankmates also became infected. The viremia profiles and multiple routes of infection suggest alligators may play an important role in WNV transmission in areas with high population densities of juvenile alligators."
25685830,An Endotoxin Tolerance Signature Predicts Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction at Initial Clinical Presentation.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis involves aberrant immune responses to infection, but the exact nature of this immune dysfunction remains poorly defined. Bacterial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are potent inducers of inflammation, which has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis, but repeated exposure can also induce a suppressive effect known as endotoxin tolerance or cellular reprogramming. It has been proposed that endotoxin tolerance might be associated with the immunosuppressive state that was primarily observed during late-stage sepsis. However, this relationship remains poorly characterised. Here we clarify the underlying mechanisms and timing of immune dysfunction in sepsis. METHODS: We defined a gene expression signature characteristic of endotoxin tolerance. Gene-set test approaches were used to correlate this signature with early sepsis, both newly and retrospectively analysing microarrays from 593 patients in 11 cohorts. Then we recruited a unique cohort of possible sepsis patients at first clinical presentation in an independent blinded controlled observational study to determine whether this signature was associated with the development of confirmed sepsis and organ dysfunction. FINDINGS: All sepsis patients presented an expression profile strongly associated with the endotoxin tolerance signature (p < 0.01; AUC 96.1%). Importantly, this signature further differentiated between suspected sepsis patients who did, or did not, go on to develop confirmed sepsis, and predicted the development of organ dysfunction. INTERPRETATION: Our data support an updated model of sepsis pathogenesis in which endotoxin tolerance-mediated immune dysfunction (cellular reprogramming) is present throughout the clinical course of disease and related to disease severity. Thus endotoxin tolerance might offer new insights guiding the development of new therapies and diagnostics for early sepsis."
19961645,Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC mec) in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. A review and the experience in a tertiary-care setting.,2010,"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are increasingly recognized to cause clinically significant infections, with S. epidermidis often cited as the third most common cause of nosocomial sepsis. Among CNS, there is a high prevalence of methicillin resistance associated with staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) elements. Although identical SCCmec types can exist in S. aureus and CNS, some novel classes of SCCmec may be unique to CNS. Differences in the accuracy of identification of CNS species and use of non-standardized methods for the detection of methicillin resistance have led to confusing data in the literature. In addition to the review of SCCmec in CNS, in this paper we report a 2-year surveillance of methicillin-resistant CNS in a tertiary-care hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico."
15614459,Can BacT/Alert FA and FN blood culture bottles increase the recovery of microorganisms in the clinical laboratory?,2004,"To evaluate whether the use of BacT/Alert FA and FN blood culture bottles increases the yield of microorganisms, we performed a before-after study. BacT/Alert standard aerobic (AE) and anaerobic (AN) bottles were used from January 1999 to May 2001 (before period). FA and FN bottles were used from May 2001 to March 2003 (after period). A total of 7796 AE, 7807 AN, 4798 FA, and 4787 FN bottles were processed. There were 742 (9.5%) AE-, 598 (7.7%) AN-, 521 (10.7%) FA-, and 396 (8.3%) FN-positive bottles. From these positive bottles 776, 631, 585, and 487 microorganisms were isolated, respectively. Among the isolated microorganisms, 58 (7.5%) and 59 (10.1%) Candida species were isolated from AE and FA bottles, respectively, and 17 (2.7%) and 21 (4.3%) obligate anaerobes were isolated from AN and FN bottles, respectively. We conclude that BacT/Alert FA and FN bottles showed a higher percentage of positivity for microorganisms, in particular for Candida species and obligate anaerobes."
20030856,Management of gastro-bronchial fistula complicating a subtotal esophagectomy: a case report.,2009,"BACKGROUND: The development of a fistula between the tracheobronchial tree and the gastric conduit post esophagectomy is a rare and often fatal complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68 year old man underwent radical esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma. On postoperative day 14 the nasogastric drainage bag dramatically filled with air, without deterioration in respiratory function or progressive sepsis. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed which demonstrated a gastro-bronchial fistula in the posterior aspect of the left main bronchus. He was managed conservatively with antibiotics, enteral nutrition via jejunostomy, and non-invasive respiratory support. A follow- up bronchoscopy 60 days after the diagnostic bronchoscopy, confirmed spontaneous closure of the fistula CONCLUSIONS: This is the first such case where a conservative approach with no surgery or endoprosthesis resulted in a successful outcome, with fistula closure confirmed at subsequent bronchoscopy. Our experience would suggest that in very carefully selected cases where bronchopulmonary contamination from the fistula is minimal or absent, there is no associated inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree and the patient is stable from a respiratory point of view without evidence of sepsis, there may be a role for a trial of conservative management."
25540275,Chikungunya virus RNA and antibody testing at a National Reference Laboratory since the emergence of Chikungunya virus in the Americas.,2015,"Since first reported in the Americas in December 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections have been documented in travelers returning from the Caribbean, with many cases identified by CHIKV antibody and/or RNA testing at our laboratory. We used our large data set to characterize the relationship between antibody titers and RNA detection and to estimate IgM persistence. CHIKV RNA was measured by nucleic acid amplification and CHIKV IgG/IgM by indirect immunofluorescence. Of the 1,306 samples submitted for RNA testing in January through September 2014, 393 (30%) were positive; for 166 RNA-positive samples, CHIKV antibody testing was also ordered, and 84% were antibody negative. Of the 6,971 sera submitted for antibody testing in January through September 2014, 1,811 (26%) were IgM positive; 1,461 IgM positives (81%) were also IgG positive. The relationship between the CHIKV antibody titers and RNA detection was evaluated using 376 IgM-positive samples (138 with RNA testing ordered and 238 deidentified and tested for RNA). RNA detection showed no significant association with the IgM titer but was inversely related to the IgG titer; 63% of the IgG negative sera were RNA positive, compared to 36% of sera with low IgG titers (1:10 to 1:80) and 16% with IgG titers of >/=1:160. Using second-sample results from 62 seroconverters, we estimated that CHIKV IgM persists for 110 days (95% confidence interval, 78 to 150 days) after the initial antibody-negative sample. These findings indicate that (i) RNA detection is more sensitive than antibody detection early in CHIKV infection, (ii) in the absence of RNA results, the IgG titer of the IgM-positive samples may be a useful surrogate for viremia, and (iii) CHIKV IgM persists for approximately 4 months after symptom onset."
41475060,Unveiling TCM-antibiotic synergy through multi-omics: Shuganning injection potentiates the effect of linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant threat to global public health due to its multidrug resistance, highlighting the need for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Computational repurposing has predicted that Shuganning injection (SGN), a clinically used hepatoprotective traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits synergistic activity with antibiotics against MRSA. However, the antimicrobial properties of SGN remain insufficiently characterized. PURPOSE: To evaluate the anti-MRSA activity of SGN and to elucidate the mechanism underlying its synergy with linezolid (LZD). METHODS: The components of SGN were identified using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Antimicrobial potential was predicted through computational repurposing and validated through bactericidal and synergy assays. Biofilm inhibition, morphological changes, and cell wall integrity were assessed. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics were employed to investigate SGN-LZD synergy. Key findings were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR and confirmed through targeted pharmacological inhibition. Finally, in vivo efficacy was assessed in Galleria mellonella and murine skin infection models. RESULTS: Fifty-two components were identified in SGN. Computational repurposing analysis indicated that SGN reversed sepsis-associated gene dysregulation and inhibited the growth of clinically isolated MRSA417, with corresponding MIC and MBC values of 42.5 and 170 mg/mL (crude drug equivalent), respectively. SGN demonstrated partial synergy with LZD (FICI = 0.75). The combination markedly inhibited MRSA biofilm formation by 94.25%, compared to 40.40% for SGN alone. Sub-MIC combinations caused structural damage, evidenced by increased extracellular alkaline phosphatase levels and disrupted bacterial morphology. Multi-omics analysis indicated co-downregulation of two-component system (TCS)-related metabolites (e.g., L-malic acid) and genes (saeRS, vraSR), indicating TCS suppression as the key mechanism underlying SGN-LZD synergy. The combination downregulated key TCS mRNAs. Furthermore, TCS inhibitors did not enhance its anti-biofilm and antibacterial effects. Notably, the SGN-LZD combination improved survival in G. mellonella and promoted wound healing in a murine skin infection model. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the repositioning of SGN for MRSA treatment. SGN impairs TCS-mediated virulence regulation, cell envelope integrity, and essential metabolic pathways, thereby enhancing the efficacy of LZD. These findings offer a translational framework for drug repurposing and highlight the clinical potential of SGN-LZD combination therapy for drug-resistant infections."
15584973,Immunological analysis in paediatric HIV patients at different stages of the disease.,2004,"There are only few clinical studies on complement in well-defined (or characterized) paediatric HIV patients. Aim of this study was to evaluate the complement system and immunoglobulins in HIV-infected children and to correlate data to stage of disease. Blood samples of 127 HIV-infected children (11-134 months; 62 male : 65 female) were collected in order to evaluate humoral immunity. The patients were classified according to CDC clinical (N-asymptomatic; A-mild symptoms such as common recurrent infections; B-moderate symptoms such as Candidiasis and herpes infections, meningitis, sepsis and anaemia; C-severe symptoms such as opportunistic infections and neoplasia) and with respect to immunological criteria (T CD4(+) cell count). Analysis of complement system included the classical (CH50), alternative (APH50) pathway activities and plasma concentrations of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), of the C4 allotypic variants C4A and C4B. (ELISA), and of the C3 split product C3d (rocket immunoeletrophoresis). Immunodiagnosis also included CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte count and immunoglobulin concentrations. Complement activation and consumption was observed in all patients correlating with disease activity. Activated classical and alternative pathways and elevated C3d were significantly correlated with immunologic category 3. C3d levels were also significantly correlated with immunologic category 1. Undetectable CH50 and APH50 were found in two (group C) and 10 patients (n = 2, A = 2, B = 2, C = 4), respectively. Low MBL values were found in 13/127 but without correlation to disease severity. Undetectable C4B levels were observed in three patients, favouring the diagnosis of a complete deficiency. Although not related to clinical symptomatology, a strong ongoing complement activation can be observed in all stages of HIV infection. In contrast to earlier reports MBL could not be considered as a risk factor for HIV."
41443201,Diagnostic Utility of Combined Serum Procalcitonin and C-Reactive Proteins in Neonatal Sepsis.,2025,"Aims/Background Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is hindered by nonspecific clinical signs and suboptimal biomarkers. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), both individually and in combination, and assess the robustness and clinical utility of a combined predictive model. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort (2022-2025, Longyan First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, China) included 293 neonates (161 with sepsis and 132 controls). Univariate logistic regression was applied to compare the clinical and laboratory parameters between the sepsis and control groups. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, contingency tables, and the DeLong tests. A logistic regression-based combined prediction model was developed using a 7:3 stratified random split into training and validation sets. Model robustness was assessed via calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and visualized as a nomogram. Subgroup and culture-confirmed-only sensitivity analyses further assessed the consistency of the combined predictive model. Results Sepsis cases exhibited significantly higher PCT, CRP, and white blood cell (WBC), and lower hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) (all p < 0.001). Univariate logistic regression confirmed PCT [odds ratio (OR) = 3.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.23-4.93, p < 0.001] and CRP (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.003) as significant predictors of neonatal sepsis. The combined PCT-CRP model provided better diagnostic performance, achieving a significantly greater area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) than either marker alone (0.88 for PCT, 0.87 for CRP) as shown by DeLong test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the model maintained higher sensitivity (82.61%) while significantly improving specificity (93.18%) and overall diagnostic accuracy (87.36%). The nomogram, validated in both sets, exhibited good calibration and net clinical benefit in DCA. Subgroup analysis confirmed consistent predictive performance across gestational age, delivery mode, and sex, with CRP more pronounced in preterm infants. Sensitivity analyses using culture-confirmed sepsis validated model robustness (AUC = 0.94). Conclusion PCT and CRP are key diagnostic biomarkers for neonatal sepsis. Their integration as a combined predictive model significantly enhances diagnostic performance and clinical applicability, providing a practical framework for early sepsis identification and potential for clinical implementation."
31852690,Impact of radiological diagnostics in the survivor of disseminated Fournier gangrene patient with septic pulmonary embolism.,2019,"A 51-year-old diabetic man diagnosed with prostatic abscess underwent its drainage twice. Following surgery he developed fever and right-sided painless visual loss due to endophthalmitis. To rule out its endogenous source CT scan was done which showed multisystem aetiology and complications. His pelvic CT and CT cystogram revealed postsurgical urethral injury along with urinary extravasation, perineal and pelvic soft tissues air densities with fat stranding ascribed to Fournier gangrene, air in distended urinary bladder due to emphysematous cystitis and right common iliac vein air containing septic thrombus. CT chest spotted bilateral multiple septic pulmonary emboli. These radiological findings were promptly handled by uro-surgical team followed by alliance with other relevant departments. With hasty surgical drainage/debridement, urological restoration of urinary obstruction, aggressive broad spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation and radiological follow-ups the patient withstood multisystem lethal complications and come up with excellent outcome except evisceration."

41432140,Serum Symmetric Dimethylarginine as a Predictor of Toxicity of Carboplatin in Dogs.,2026,"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) predicts carboplatin clearance and myelotoxicity in humans and cats. This relationship is unknown in dogs. In canines, elevated serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) correlates with reduced GFR. This study prospectively evaluated whether dogs with elevated SDMA (> 14 mug/dL) are at increased risk of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity following carboplatin chemotherapy. Plasma samples were collected to determine if SDMA or other factors are significant determinants of carboplatin pharmacokinetics. Thirty client-owned dogs weighing > 15 kg with confirmed neoplasia were enrolled. Dogs received carboplatin intravenously (300 mg/m(2)). SDMA was measured on the day of treatment. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was done to identify possible covariates affecting pharmacokinetic parameters. Adverse effects were monitored with weekly complete blood counts and owner assessment forms. Five dogs had elevated SDMA; four had significantly reduced carboplatin clearance (mean 93.9, range 76.1-116.8 mL/h/kg) compared with dogs with SDMA </= 14 mug/dL (mean 185.4, range 114.3-268.3 mL/h/kg, p < 0.001). Three dogs with elevated SDMA experienced grade 4 neutropenia; one was euthanized due to sepsis. Two additional dogs with elevated SDMA were euthanized 5- and 13-days post treatment due to severe gastrointestinal signs. Twenty-five dogs had SDMA </= 14 mug/dL: 10 had asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 3 had grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity, and none died. Elevated SDMA was associated with decreased carboplatin clearance in dogs and predicted risk for treatment-related toxicity and death in our study population."
26021540,Perirectal sepsis after rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids : a case report.,2014,"Rubber band ligation (Barron ligation, RBL) is a widely used method for the treatment of symptomatic -haemorrhoids. In general, it is considered as a safe, effective and easily performed way of treating second and third -degree haemorrhoids. Perineal and pelvic sepsis was already known to be a rare, but possible complication after stapled haemorrhoidopexy. However, there have been some reports of severe sepsis after rubber band ligation as well. We -present a patient who was treated twice for haemorrhoids with rubber band ligation and attended the emergency department 10 days later. He was diagnosed with perirectal sepsis and aggressive antibiotic treatment was the first attempt of treatment. Because of further deterioration under medical therapy, our patient required extensive surgery."
20512289,C-reactive protein is not a useful indicator for infection in surgical intensive care units.,2009,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is commonly used as a marker for inflammatory states and for early identification of infection. This study aimed to investigate CRP as a marker for infection in patients with postoperative septic shock. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, single-center study, developed in a surgical intensive care unit at Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo. METHODS: This study evaluated 54 patients in the postoperative period, of whom 29 had septic shock (SS group) and 25 had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS group). All of the patients were monitored over a seven-day period using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and daily CRP and lactate measurements. RESULTS: The daily CRP measurements did not differ between the groups. There was no correlation between CRP and lactate levels and the SOFA score in the groups. We observed that the plasma CRP concentrations were high in almost all of the patients. The patients presented an inflammatory state postoperatively in response to surgical aggression. This could explain the elevated CRP measurements, regardless of whether the patient was infected or not. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show any correlation between CRP and infection among patients with SIRS and septic shock during the early postoperative period."

This has been more often seen with the current sensitive biomarker assays for myocardial necrosis. Acute illnesses, spontaneous coronary dissection, sepsis, pulmonary embolism and coagulation disorders are some of the common clinical situation where elevated cardiac markers are noted. We describe two brothers presenting with acute myocardial infarction due to thrombus without any obvious cause."
41472702,Aggressive Chemotherapy and Antepartum Management of Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary of Hypercalcemic Type: A Novel Case Report with Ethical and Medical Decision-Making Consideration.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Small-cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, aggressive, and highly fatal gynecologic malignancy with few treatment guidelines offered in nonpregnant patients. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old woman presented for initial prenatal care at 9 weeks and her dating ultrasound was notable for a large complex adnexal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 weeks later revealed accelerated interval growth with possible malignant etiology. She underwent surgical evaluation with salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathology noted signature features of SCCOHT. The patient desired expectant management and declined termination of pregnancy or chemotherapy. Four weeks later, she developed severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and she was diagnosed with extensive metastatic disease. After multidisciplinary and multi-institutional counseling, she elected for continuation of her pregnancy and 6-agent chemotherapy including Vinblastine, Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Bleomycin, Doxorubicin, Etoposide (VPCBAE) with close antepartum surveillance. The patient completed multiple rounds of chemotherapy and subsequently delivered via primary cesarean at 27 (2/7) weeks due to maternal sepsis and nonreassuring fetal status. Maternal and neonatal death occurred approximately 1-week postpartum. CONCLUSION: This is the first known case of SCCOHT in which the pregnancy was continued through an aggressive chemotherapy regimen."
19948445,Diffuse postoperative peritonitis -- value of diagnostic parameters and impact of early indication for relaparotomy.,2009,"OBJECTIVE: Current criteria for performing relaparotomy for suspected peritonitis are non explicit and based on non-quantitative, subjective arguments or hospital practice. The aim of this study was to determine the value of routinely used clinical and diagnostic parameters in early detection of postoperative, diffuse peritonitis (PP). Furthermore, the prognosis and outcome after early indication for relaparotomy in patients with PP compared to community-aquired peritonitis (CAP) was evaluated. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2008, a total of 251 patients with diffuse secondary peritonitis either postoperative (PP) or community acquired (CAP) were analyzed retrospectively. PP (n = 114) and CAP (n = 137) were compared regarding physical examination, MPI-Score, APACHE II-Score, evidence of organ failure, laboratory parameters, diagnostic instruments and clinical course. The treatment regimen comprised surgical source control (with/without programmed lavage), abdominal closure and relaparotomy on demand, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and intensive care support. RESULTS: The APACHE II-Score (20 CAP vs. 22 PP, p = 0.012), MPI-Score (27 CAP vs. 30 PP, p = 0.001) and the number of lavages differed significantly. Positive phyiscal testing and signs of sepsis (abdominal pain (81.6% PP vs. CAP 97.1%, p = 0.03), rebound tenderness (21.9% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.02), fever (35.1% vs. 51.8%, p = 0.03)) occurred significantly less often in the PP patients than in the CAP group. Conventional radiography (66.2%) and ultrasonography (44.3%) had a lower diagnostic sensitivity than did abdominal CT-scan (97.2%). Mortality was higher in the PP group but did not differ significantly between the two groups (47.4% PP vs. 35.8% CAP, p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: The value of physical tests and laboratory parameters in diagnosing abdominal sepsis is limited. CT-scanning revealed the highest diagnostic accuracy. A treatment regimen of early relaprotomy appears to be the most reasonable strategy for as early discovery of postoperative peritonitis as possible."
25568525,Poorly Regulated Blood Glucose in Diabetic Patients-predictor of Acute Infections.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus, the most frequent endocrinology disease is a predisposing factor for infections. Diabetic patients have 4,4 times greater risk of systemic infection than non diabetics. AIM: a) To determine the prevalence and characteristics of acute infectious diseases in hospitalized diabetics; b) To correlate values of blood glucose levels and HbA1c with acute infections in hospitalized diabetics; c) To identify the etiology of infectious diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 450 diabetic patients hospitalized in the 24-month period in the Intensive care unit of the Clinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders CCUS. In 204 patients (45,3%) there was an acute infectious condition and the following data was registered: a) gender and age; b) basic illness; c) laboratory parameters of inflammation (Le, CRP); d) blood glucose upon admission, parameters of glucoregulation (HbA1c, fructosamine); e) type of infection; f) verification of etiological agent; g) late complications of diabetes; and h) outcome. RESULTS: Out of 204 diabetic patients with infection, there was 35,3% men and 64,7% women. More than half of patients (61%) were in the age group 61-80 years. The most common primary disease was Diabetes mellitus type 2. HbA1c and fructosamine were significantly increased in diabetic patients with acute infection compared to diabetics without acute infection. There is a positive correlation between HbA1c levels and CRP, and blood glucose and CRP in diabetic patients with acute infection. Most frequent infections: urinary tract infection (70,0%), followed by respiratory infections (11,8%), soft tissue infections (10,3%), generalized-bacteremia / sepsis (6,9%). The most common cause of urinary infection and generalized infection was Escherichia colli. The most common bacteria causing soft tissue infections was Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Almost half (45,3%) of hospitalized diabetic patients had acute infectious condition. They present most frequently in women, aged 61-80 years, with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. HbA1c and fructosamine were significantly increased in diabetic patients with acute infection. There is a positive correlation between the parameters of inflammation and glucoregulation in diabetics with acute infection. Most frequent was a urinary tract infection and the most common causative agent was Escherichia coli. The most common cause of soft tissue infections was Staphylococcus aureus. Out of 21 patients with verified soft tissue infections, 18 of them (85,7%) had confirmed diagnosis of diabetic microangiopathy diabetica. A total of 96,1% of patients fully recovered."
15599140,Sources of variability on the estimate of treatment effect in the PROWESS trial: implications for the design and conduct of future studies in severe sepsis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate sources of variability in the estimate of treatment effects in a successful phase 3 trial in severe sepsis and to assess their implications on the design of future clinical trials. DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of prospectively defined subgroups from a large phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trial (PROWESS). SETTING: The study involved 164 medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients were 1,690 patients with severe sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (Xigris) 24 microg/kg/hr for 96 hrs, or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All prospectively defined subgroups were examined to identify treatment effects that potentially differed across subgroup strata (assessed by Breslow-Day p < .10). Potential interactions were identified for subgroups defined by a) presence vs. absence of a significant protocol violation (p = .07); b) original vs. amended protocol (p = .08); and c) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II quartile at baseline (p = .09). No treatment benefit was observed in patients having a protocol violation, regardless of type. There appeared to be less treatment effect in patients enrolled under the original vs. amended protocol. The risk ratio exceeded 1.0 for patients in the lowest APACHE II score quartile. A highly significant correlation was observed between the sequence of enrollment at a site, the frequency of protocol violations, and the observed treatment effect. As enrollment increased, frequency of protocol violations decreased (p < .0001) and the treatment effect improved. The correlation between the sequence of enrollment and improvement in treatment effect remained even after removal of patients with protocol violations. Removal of the first block of patients at each site from the analysis reduced the extent of interaction by protocol version and APACHE II score. CONCLUSIONS: A learning curve appeared to be present within the PROWESS trial such that the ability to demonstrate efficacy improved with increasing site experience. This potential learning curve may have implications for design of future trials. Investigational sites may need to require a minimum level of protocol-specific experience to appropriately implement a given trial. This experience should be an important consideration in designing trials and analysis plans. Diligence by coordinating centers, site investigators, study coordinators, and sponsors is necessary to ensure that the protocol is executed as designed such that a treatment benefit, if present, will be evident."
41477644,Predictive models of immune microenvironment-related markers in patients with sepsis accompanied by myocardial dysfunction and their roles in diagnosis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate immune microenvironment markers for predicting sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) and establish three predictive models-nomogram, decision tree, and gradient boosting machine (GBM)-to compare their efficacy in assessing SIMD risk. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 165 patients with sepsis who were admitted between January 2022 and February 2025. Patients were divided into SIMD and non-SIMD groups according to the occurrence of SIMD. Risk factors influencing the occurrence of SIMD in patients with sepsis were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomogram, decision tree, and GBM models were constructed based on the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discrimination of each model. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores of the three models were calculated. RESULT: : Among the 165 patients with sepsis included in the study, 75 were in the SIMD group, accounting for 45.45% (75/165). Univariate analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in APACHE II score, white blood cell count, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a high APACHE II score (OR = 1.480, 95% CI: 1.127-1.945), high NT-proBNP level (OR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.005-1.021), high sTREM-1 level (OR = 1.116, 95% CI: 1.034-1.205), and high HMGB1 level (OR = 1.006, 95% CI: 1.002-1.011) were risk factors for SIMD in patients with sepsis (P < 0.05). All three prediction models demonstrated excellent performance in the training set: nomogram (AUC = 0.843), decision tree (AUC = 0.815), and GBM (AUC = 0.885). No significant differences were observed in the AUC values among the models (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The immune markers, sTREM-1 and HMGB1, were associated with SIMD. Elevated APACHE II score and NT-proBNP, sTREM-1, and HMGB1 levels are risk factors for SIMD in patients with sepsis. Predictive models based on these factors demonstrate strong performance and effectively identify high-risk individuals, aiding in early clinical intervention."
20029392,"Medical conditions and outcomes at 1 year after acute traumatic spinal cord injury in a Greek and a Swedish region: a prospective, population-based study.",2010,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. This paper is part of the Stockholm Thessaloniki Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Study (STATSCIS). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare outcomes, length of stay (LOS), associated conditions and medical complications at 1-year post-trauma. SETTINGS: The Greater Thessaloniki region, Greece, and the Greater Stockholm region, Sweden. While Stockholm follows a SCI system of care, Thessaloniki follows a fragmented 'non-system' approach. SUBJECTS: Out of the 87 cases in Thessaloniki and the 49 cases in Stockholm who comprised the study population of STATSCIS, 75 and 42 cases respectively were successfully followed-up during the first year post-trauma. RESULTS: Significantly superior outcomes (that is, survival with neurological recovery, functional ability and discharge to home) and shorter LOS for initially motor complete cases occurred in Stockholm. Management routines known to increase long-term morbidity, for example, long-term tracheostomy and indwelling urethral catheters were significantly more common in Thessaloniki. Major medical complications, that is, multiple pressure ulcers, heterotopic ossification and bacteremia/sepsis were more frequent in Thessaloniki. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show how two rather similar cohorts of TSCI manifest large discrepancies in terms of 1-year outcomes and complications, depending on the type of management they receive. As the major difference between regions was the presence or absence of a SCI system of care, rather than differences in availability of modern medicine, the mere presence of the latter does not seem to be sufficient to guarantee adequate outcomes. This study provides strong evidence as to the urgent need of implementing a SCI system of care in Greece."
15700673,[Karyotypic investigation of two cases of invasive candidiasis].,2004,"Investigation of the genetic relationship of the three Candida albicans strains isolated from each of two patients, one with C. albicans meningitis and the other with pancreatic pseudocyst (PP), by PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis), was aimed in this study. Three strains of C. albicans isolated from bloodstream, abscess and drainage fluid of the patient with PP were found to show the same karyotype, while three strains of C. albicans from cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal swab culture and stool sample of the patient with meningitis were found closely related. As a conclusion, PFGE enables to give valuable information about the probable source of transmission on individual basis in these two invasive candida infections."
25834731,Endovascular recanalisation of an acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion. A case report and review of the literature.,2015,"INTRODUCTION: Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) continues to have a high mortality, ranging from 60 to 80%. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 78-year-old male presented with a 20-hour history of abdominal pain, secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thromboembolic occlusion diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) angiography. Following confirmation of bowel viability at laparotomy, endovascular intervention using combined thrombolysis, angioplasty and thromboaspiration was performed. Despite successful recanalisation of the occlusion, his condition continued to deteriorate fatally due to progressive sepsis. DISCUSSION: We discuss the role of biphasic CT in diagnosis of AMI, and review the evidence for endovascular interventions now increasingly used in the emergent management of thromboembolic AMI. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis using CT angiography is essential, as it is highly sensitive in detecting a visceral arterial occlusion. However, laparotomy is often required to accurately determine bowel viability and the need for resection. Endovascular interventions appear to be effective alternatives to open surgery with appropriate patient selection."
31883446,"Discovery of potential 1,3,5-Triazine compounds against strains of Plasmodium falciparum using supervised machine learning models.",2020,"The Malaria burden was an escalating global encumbrance and need to be addressed with critical care. Anti-malarial drug discovery was integrated with supervised machine learning (ML) models to identify potent thiazolyl-traizine derivatives. This assimilated approach of Direct Kernel-based Partial Least Squares regression (DKPLS) with molprint 2D fingerprints in Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship models was utilized to map the knowledge of known actives and to design novel molecules. This QSAR study had revealed the structural features required for better antimalarial activity. Two of the molecules which were designed based on the results of this QSAR study, had shown good percentage of parasitemia against both chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine resistant (Dd2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum respectively. The IC(50) of 201D and 204D was 3.02 and 2.17 microM against chloroquine resistant Dd2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. This result had proved the efficiency of a multidisciplinary approach of medicinal chemistry and machine learning for the design of novel potent anti-malarial compounds."
31862813,Native valve endocarditis caused by E rysipelothrix Rh usiopathiae: presenting with refractory heart failure and requiring surgical valve replacement-report on a rare zoonosis.,2019,"Erysipelothrix Rhusiopathiae is a Gram-positive bacillus that is ubiquitous in nature. The bacterium is a zoonotic pathogen known to infect wild and domestic animals. Human infections, however, are uncommon and typically present with localised or generalised cutaneous lesions. Systemic infection in the form of bacteraemia with seeding to various organs is the least common form of the disease. Infections in humans tend to be associated with occupational exposure and close contact with animals. Clinical data of a 61-year-old male patient with Gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia and E. Rh usiopathiae-induced endocarditis are presented here. The patient presented with refractory congestive heart failure secondary to severe acute aortic regurgitation mandating surgical valve replacement. The described case has special clinical merit given the lack of fever and leukocytosis, absence of erysipeloid cutaneous manifestations and refractoriness to medical management. E. Rhusiopathiae should be considered in the differential diagnosis for Gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia and endocarditis. In the proper clinical setting, occupational exposure and animal contacts are helpful clues to raise suspicion for this bacillus. The high mortality associated with the pathogen should urge for early identification and initiation of antimicrobial treatment."
41675927,Analysis of prognostic risk factors and risk management measures for patients with ischemic stroke and bloodstream infection based on machine learning.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Through the machine learning Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, the system screened core prognostic risk factors for patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infection, constructed and validated a predictive model, provides a basis for formulating precise risk management strategies in clinical practice. METHODS: Clinical data from patients with bloodstream infections secondary to ischaemic stroke were retrospectively included. The dataset was randomly allocated into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Within the training set, Model 1 was constructed using traditional univariate and multivariate Cox regression methods, while Model 2 employed the machine learning LASSO regression algorithm. Models were compared using metrics including R-squared, C-index. The superior model was selected for validation on both training and validation sets using Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curves, and Decision-Making Curves (DCA). RESULTS: Model 2 was adopted as the final model, with a nomogram generated for the training set. As demonstrated by the nomogram, an increase in the total score was observed in patients with concomitant pneumonia, heart failure (HF), or coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD), in cases where mechanical ventilation (MV) was utilised, and in instances of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and C-reactive protein-lymphocyte ratio (CLR) values, and reduced albumin levels. In the training set, the AUC values for predicting 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day survival rates were 0.875, 0.886, and 0.861, respectively. The AUC value for the 28-day prognosis on the internal test set was 0.844, while that on the external validation dataset was 0.860. The model demonstrated high concordance between predicted and actual probabilities across three distinct cohorts. The clinical decision curve indicates that the model provides good net benefit within the 5%-25% range at all three time points (7,14,and 28 days) across the three datasets. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities such as pneumonia and hypoalbuminaemia constitute prognostic risk factors affecting patients with ischaemic stroke and bloodstream infections. LASSO regression enables precise identification of these risk factors, yielding a prognostic prediction model with outstanding predictive efficacy and clinical utility. Clinicians may utilise model variables to implement targeted risk management strategies."
41623649,Whole-genome sequencing-based source tracing and infection control of Serratia marcescens blood culture events in pediatric patients.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) is an opportunistic pathogen increasingly associated with nosocomial infections in immunocompromised pediatric patients. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and molecular epidemiological characteristics of S. marcescens-positive blood cultures and to provide evidence for targeted infection prevention strategies. METHODS: Eleven cases of S. marcescens-positive blood cultures were identified across eight pediatric wards of a tertiary hospital in China in October 2024. Clinical and microbiological assessments were conducted to distinguish true infections from contamination. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize resistance, virulence, and plasmid replicons. Core genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenies, Bayesian temporal inference, and transmission tree reconstruction were used to explore genetic relatedness, transmission dynamics, and cryptic cases. RESULTS: Two cases were diagnosed as hospital-acquired sepsis, while nine were classified as contamination. The isolates exhibited intrinsic resistance to first- and second-generation cephalosporins but remained susceptible to carbapenems. Seven resistance genes-including aac(6')-Ic, oqxB, and tet(41)-and four virulence genes, including cheY and fliM, were identified. Nine isolates carried IncFII-type plasmids. Core genome SNP analysis revealed minimal genetic divergence, with the most recent common ancestor traceable to late 2023, suggesting approximately 10 months of silent transmission. Transmission tree inference further indicated the presence of undetected cryptic cases. Following the implementation of bundled interventions-including sink replacements and disinfectant use, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and environmental decontamination-no new cases occurred during 1 month of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study identified a highly clonal S. marcescens cluster with evidence of prolonged, unnoticed circulation and cross-ward transmission in the pediatric units. These findings underscore the hidden persistence of this pathogen in the hospital environment and the need for strengthened infection control measures."
41399648,Prognostic Value of the Albumin Corrected Anion Gap in ICU Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Sepsis: A MIMIC-IV Cohort Study.,2025,"PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at increased risk of sepsis, a condition associated with high mortality. The anion gap (AG) is commonly used to assess acid-base disturbances, but its reliability declines in hypoalbuminemia. The albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) may provide greater accuracy, yet its prognostic value in COPD patients with sepsis, defined according to Sepsis-3 criteria, remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2072 ICU patients with COPD and sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). Cox regression models evaluated the association between ACAG and mortality, Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated survival differences, restricted cubic splines examined nonlinear relationships, and subgroup analyses assessed consistency across strata. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared the predictive performance of ACAG, AG, and serum albumin. RESULTS: Elevated ACAG was independently associated with both short- and long-term mortality. In fully adjusted models, each 1 mmol/L increase in ACAG was linked to higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR 1.064, 95% CI 1.042-1.086, P < 0.001) and 365-day mortality (HR 1.065, 95% CI 1.043-1.087, P < 0.001). A threshold effect was observed at >/=19.25 mmol/L, above which mortality risk increased markedly (28-day HR 1.336, 95% CI 1.126-1.586, P = 0.001; 365-day HR 1.429, 95% CI 1.208-1.691, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed significant differences (log-rank P < 0.0001), and ROC analysis demonstrated that ACAG provided superior discrimination compared with AG and albumin for both 28-day (AUC = 0.734) and 365-day mortality (AUC = 0.696). Associations were consistent across clinical subgroups without significant interactions. CONCLUSION: Elevated ACAG was an independent predictor of 28-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD and sepsis. An inflection point of approximately 19.25 mmol/L identified a clinically meaningful threshold for risk stratification. As a simple and widely accessible parameter, ACAG may facilitate threshold-based triage and individualized management in this high-risk population, though external validation in multicenter prospective cohorts is warranted."
41647020,Development and validation of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common and debilitating complication after sepsis. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict post-sepsis cognitive impairment and identify key clinical risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 866 adult sepsis patients treated in our hospital between January 2020 and January 2025 was analyzed. Cognitive function was assessed 1-3 months after discharge using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with scores < 26 indicating impairment. Key predictors were selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Five ML models-logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT)-were developed and evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied for interpretability. RESULTS: Cognitive impairment occurred in 195 patients (22.5%). Seven variables were identified as key predictors of cognitive impairment, including age, years of education, septic shock, benzodiazepine use, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) level. The RF model performed best, with AUCs of 0.947 (training set) and 0.895 (validation set), showing good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis showed that SOFA score had the greatest influence on cognitive impairment, followed by age, APACHE II score, IL-10, and years of education. CONCLUSION: Using SHAP analysis, the RF model provided clear insights into the key factors contributing to the model's prediction of cognitive impairment after sepsis. The model not only achieved high predictive accuracy but also offered a transparent, data-driven tool to identify patients at elevated risk, potentially enabling timely interventions and tailored clinical management."
41451084,Early prediction of ARDS caused by non-pulmonary sepsis based on machine learning algorithms of inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. Early identification and prediction of the occurrence of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis patients are of vital importance for timely intervention and improving the prognosis of these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 482 patients were included in this study. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method was employed to identify the key variables related to the prognosis of sepsis. The selected variables were used to construct nine different machine learning prediction models. To evaluate the performance of the model, we employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, calibration curve, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). The clinical significance of the model was further analyzed through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis. RESULTS: Through the RFE method, the final selected 11 variables. In the training set and test set, the AUC of the LightGBM model was 0.954 (95% CI: 0.933-0.973) and 0.923 (95% CI: 0.864-0.967) respectively. In this study, the calibration curve of the LightGBM model was close to the diagonal, indicating that its probability predictions were relatively reliable. In the DCA curves, the LightGBM model consistently maintained the highest net gain within the threshold range of 0-0.4, indicating LightGBM has greater clinical practical value. Through SHAP analysis, it was found that the SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, lactate level, creatinine, and SAPS II score were the five most important features in the model prediction. CONCLUSION: In this study, a machine learning model based on inflammatory indicators and blood gas parameters was successfully developed and validated to predict the risk of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis."
41643412,Low risk of endometrioma infection after oocyte retrieval.,2025,"RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage following oocyte retrieval in women with ovarian endometrioma? DESIGN: This retrospective observational cohort study included women aged 18-43 years with a confirmed radiological diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma who underwent ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or fertility preservation between January 2018 and December 2023 at a single tertiary academic centre. All procedures were performed under standardized aseptic conditions with antibiotic prophylaxis. Transcystic puncture was performed when deemed necessary. The primary outcome was the incidence of endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage within 30 days after oocyte retrieval. RESULTS: Oocyte retrievals were performed in 1102 out of 1668 cycles (66.1%) for IVF/ICSI and in 566 cycles (33.9%) for fertility preservation. Bilateral endometriomas were present in 322 of 880 patients (36.6%), with a mean cyst (SD) diameter of 31.5 +/- 22.7 mm. Endometriomas larger than 30 mm accounted for 295 of 649 cases (45.5%). Intentional transcystic puncture was performed in 76 of 1148 applicable procedures (6.6%), and endometrioma drainage during oocyte retrieval occurred in 52 cases (4.5%). Endometrioma infections requiring surgical drainage occurred in 6 of 1668 procedures (0.36%). Only one infection was reported following transcystic puncture (1.3%). No cases of sepsis or septic shock occurred. Five infections were managed with ultrasound-guided transvaginal drainage; one required laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endometrioma infection requiring surgical intervention after oocyte retrieval, including after transcystic puncture, is low. These findings support the safety of assisted reproductive techniques in women with endometriomas."
15724391,Evaluation of natural killer cells as diagnostic markers of early onset neonatal sepsis: comparison with C-reactive protein and interleukin-8.,2004,"This study was conducted on thirty-seven neonates and healthy neonates (sixteen full term and fourteen preterm). The study aimed at revealing the role played by the NK cells in neonatal sepsis and evaluating the sensitivity of NK cell number and cytotoxicity as diagnostic markers in infants with suspected early neonatal sepsis compared with the circulating cytokine IL-8 and CRP levels. All samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes were subjected to determination of CD16 and CD56 positive cells using flow cytometry and NK cytotoxicity using the standard 4h 51Cr release assay. Sera were separated to measure IL-8 using ELISA. Determination of CRP, using turbdimetric assay, as well as blood cultures were done for patient's group only. Out of the 37 cases of suspected early neonatal sepsis, 16 were given final diagnosis of sepsis. Seven infants (43.8%) in the sepsis group had culture-proven diagnosis, one of which had meningitis. The median CRP value was significantly higher in sepsis group (88 mg/L; range: 17-159 mg/L) compared with that in non-septic group (15.4 mg/L; range: 7.6-23.2 mg/L, p < 0.001) only 12-60 h after admission. On the other hand, newborns in the sepsis group had significantly higher serum levels of IL-8 (median 310 pg/mL; range: 37-583 pg/ml) at study entry than that in the non septic group (median 63 pg/mL; range: 32-94 pg/ml, P < 0.001). On admission, the NK activity, rather than the number of CD16 and CD56 positive cells was much affected where NK cytotoxicity was significantly lower in sepsis group (3.4 +/- 2.1%, range 0.9-7%) than that of the nonseptic group (18.3 +/- 6.7%: range 10.7- 25.3%, p < 0.01) and healthy neonates (23.8 +/- 4.7%: range 12.2-32.3%, p < 0.001). We may conclude that defective NK cell activity rather than NK cell number plays an important role in susceptibility to early onset neonatal sepsis. Evaluation of NK cytotoxicity as a marker in early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis reveals that the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of reduced NK cytotoxicity (10% killing) was higher than both of CRP and IL-8, either individually or in combination. Additionally, reduced NK cytotoxicity showed high correlation with the severity and outcome of neonatal sepsis. Our data raise the possibility that the addition of NK cell activity to the standard work-up of critically ill patients with suspected sepsis could increase diagnostic certainty and generate an improved patient management."
31812678,An active domain HF-18 derived from hagfish intestinal peptide effectively inhibited drug-resistant bacteria in vitro/vivo.,2020,"Antibiotic resistance is spreading faster than the development of new antibiotics into clinical practice. Currently, the design of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), potential new antibacterial agents with rare antimicrobial resistance, is the available strategy to enhance the antimicrobial activity and lower the toxicity of AMPs. In this study, a peptide derived from hagfish intestinal peptide was designed and termed as HF-18 (GFFKKAWRKVKKAFRRVL). After antimicrobial/bactericidal test in vitro, we found that HF-18 exhibited a potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of only 4 mug/ml against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Meanwhile, it eliminated the test bacteria within 1 h, suggesting its rapid bactericidal effect. Importantly, this peptide had no obvious hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Furthermore, its notable antimicrobial effects in vivo was confirmed again in S. aureus induced mouse bacteremia and skin wound infection, reflecting as the decrease in bacterial counts in mouse lung or skin (up to 1.9 or 3.5 log CFU respectively), and including the inhibitory activity on inflammatory cytokines secretion. The possible mechanisms underlying HF-18 against drug-resistant S. aureus may attribute that HF-18 neutralized the negative charge in S. aureus surface and then disrupted the integrity of cell membranes to enhance the permeation of bacterial membrane, showing as the increased uptake of NPN and PI and the obvious morphology changes of S. aureus. In addition, this peptide bound to bacterial genomic DNA to suppress the expression of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) and nuclease (nuc) genes, which play major roles in S. aureus virulence. The properties of HF-18 suggest a path towards developing antibacterial agents that has stronger antibacterial activity and greater security for clinical treatment of infection induced by S. aureus, especially drug-resistant S. aureus."
20458955,[Mini-invasive methods in the treatment of abdominal sepsis caused by abdominal cavity abscess].,2009,"In 2002-2008 yrs 85 patients were treated for abdominal cavity abscess (ACA). Hepatic abscess was revealed in 41 (33.6%) patients, subhepatic one--in 14 (16.5%), right-sided subdiaphragmatic--in 12 (14.1%), left-sided--in 18 (21.2%). In 42 (49.4%) patients abdominal sepsis was diagnosed, of them in 25 (29.4%)--severe one, in 18 (21.2%)--polyorganic insufficiency syndrome. For ACA in 67 (78.8%) patients the puncture--drainage interventions under ultrasonographic guidance were performed and in 18 (21.2%)--laparotomy. Miniinvasive interventions application in 48 (56.5%) patients had permitted to remove the sepsis signs already on the third--fifth day. In 19 (22.4%) patients in severe sepsis veno--venous hemodyafiltration was used for extracorporeal detoxication performance. Twelve (14.1%) patients died."
25630316,Nonsurgical faecal diversion in the management of severe perianal sepsis: a retrospective evaluation of the flexible faecal management system.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Severe perianal sepsis is often difficult to manage after surgical debridement due to faecal contamination. Diversion of the faecal stream has been attempted with faecal pouches and rectal tubes, and in some cases, a diverting stoma is created. However, reversal of the stoma may be delayed due to prolonged sepsis and this is not without risks. Herein, we review the use of a flexible faecal management system in patients with severe perianal sepsis. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 15 patients who made use of the ConvaTec Flexi-Seal(R) Fecal Management System (FMS) between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2010. The demographics and comorbidities of the patients, as well as the treatment received, were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS: None of the patients required the creation of a stoma to divert the faecal stream. Nursing requirements and wound care were found to be improved with the use of the Flexi-Seal(R) FMS (fewer changes were needed). No severe complications were observed in our series. Two deaths were encountered, but the cause of death was not directly due to the initial perianal sepsis. Overall, the wound healing rate was 80.0%, with one graft failure (11.1%). CONCLUSION: The use of the Flexi-Seal(R) FMS in patients with perianal sepsis following extensive debridement is feasible and can be considered before stoma creation."
31967236,Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in the pediatric intensive care unit: a case report.,2019,"Among the infections caused by Streptococcus beta hemolyticus from the Lancefield serogroup A, toxic shock syndrome is perhaps the most severe, and its mortality rate is high. Its clinical similarity to other forms of shock, especially septic shock, can often confuse the evaluator and interfere with the selection of the most appropriate therapy. This report aims to inform readers of the need to add this syndrome as a differential diagnosis in cases of shock, especially those with no well-defined clinical manifestations. For this purpose, we present the case of an infant with common flu-like symptoms who progressed rapidly with a rash, a reduced level of consciousness and clinical and laboratory signs of shock that required intensive support. In addition to cultures indicating the etiological agent, the appearance of exanthema and necrotizing fasciitis led to the diagnosis. However, less than 50% of cases present classic clinical signs of this entity. Penicillins combined with aminoglycosides are still the therapy of choice and are supported by a high level of evidence. Despite the severity of this patient's presentation, the progression was satisfactory."
41573754,"Antimicrobial resistance in bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus from a provincial hospital, Cambodia, 2020-2022.",2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern. However, in Cambodia, as in other countries in the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region, the magnitude of the problem is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of AMR in common pathogens, namely Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from blood cultures at one provincial hospital, a national sentinel site for AMR surveillance, during a 3-year period. Sample processing and analysis were conducted at the hospital's on-site microbiology laboratory. Blood cultures were processed manually, and conventional methods were used for bacterial identification. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion and Etest minimum inhibitory concentration measurement, in accordance with current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Blood culture data from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 were extracted from the hospital's microbiology database and, for the AST analysis, deduplicated to include results only for the first isolate per patient per year. Of 6102 blood cultures collected, 529 (9%) were positive. The most common blood culture pathogens found were E. coli (150, 28% of positive isolates) and S. aureus (65, 12% of positive isolates). For E. coli, resistance to ceftriaxone was detected in 110/148 (74%) isolates and resistance to imipenem in 3/147 (2%). For S. aureus, 18/56 (32%) isolates were methicillin-resistant, but vancomycin resistance was not detected. These rates of resistance to first-line treatments are of concern and have the potential to negatively impact patient outcomes."
41456741,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy: Unraveling molecular mechanisms, emerging therapeutics, and translational frontiers.",2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a debilitating complication of systemic infection, marked by acute cognitive impairment and long-term neurological deficits in the absence of direct central nervous system (CNS) infection. Its pathogenesis involves a multifactorial interplay of neuroinflammation (e.g., cytokine storms), immune dysregulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, metabolic derangements, and impaired neuronal repair. These mechanisms synergistically contribute to neuronal injury and persistent cognitive dysfunction. Emerging therapeutic strategies-such as targeted immunomodulators, BBB-stabilizing agents, and novel CNS-targeted drug delivery-aim to interrupt this cascade and improve outcomes. Concurrently, precision medicine approaches leverage molecular profiling to tailor interventions. However, current clinical management remains supportive, hindered by incomplete mechanistic understanding and a paucity of disease-modifying therapies. This review synthesizes recent advances in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy, critically evaluates these mechanism-based therapeutic approaches, and highlights translational roadblocks in biomarker development and preclinical-to-clinical bridging. We also propose future directions to accelerate the development of targeted pharmacotherapies and personalized treatment paradigms for sepsis-associated encephalopathy."
20036548,An intradural-extramedullary gas-forming spinal abscess in a patient with diabetes mellitus.,2010,"Spinal infections are commonly reported to be located in the extradural or intramedullary spaces. Infection involving the intradural-extramedullary space are uncommon. We report a patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and an infected foot ulcer who presented with a cervical cord abscess and intradural gas. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are necessary for a favourable outcome in gas-forming intradural spinal abscesses. To our knowledge, a gas-forming intradural spinal abscess has not been reported previously and we discuss the relevant literature."
19999917,Open-book pelvic fractures with perineal open wounds: a significant morbid combination.,2009,"Open-book pelvic fractures (OBPF) with concomitant intra-abdominal injuries carry a high morbidity and mortality; the significance of associated perineal open wound (OBPF-POW) has not been defined. We hypothesize that the presence of perineal open wounds increases morbidity, mortality, and concomitant use of hospital resources. Patients diagnosed with OBPF over a 5-year period at a Level I trauma center were identified by trauma registry review, and were retrospectively reviewed under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Patients with OBPF without a perineal open wound were compared with those with OBPF-POW. Data collected included patient demographics, injury details, management, and outcomes. A total of 1,635 patients with blunt pelvic fractures were identified, of which 177 (10.8%) had OBPF. OBPF-POW (36/177) significantly increased the use of angioembolization, occurrence of sepsis, pelvic sepsis, ARDS, and multi-organ system failure. Patients with OBPF-POW had an increase of 13 days in length of hospitalization compared with the OBPF group (P < 0.001), with cost of $120,647.30 and $62,952.72 respectively (P < 0.001). Perineal open wounds complicate open-book pelvic fractures with significant increase in hospital resource utilization. Aggressive multidisciplinary evaluation and management is appropriate to detect and prevent complications."
25528966,Segmental absence of intestinal musculature -presentation in a 10-year-old boy with an extensive involved segment.,2015,"Segmental absence of the intestinal musculature is a rare cause of acute abdomen most likely associated with intestinal perforation and sepsis in neonates and adults. We present a case of a 10-year-old boy who developed acute abdomen and was treated with right hemicolectomy and partial resection of the ileum. The ileum showed a 20-cm-long stenotic segment showing prominent thinning of the intestinal wall. This case occurred in an older child, which appears to be rare when comparing the literature. The bowel defect was also the largest described to date, indicating the potential effect of an atonic segment leading to obstructive disease."
41529007,"Trends in neonatal sepsis: bacteriological profile, and antibiotic resistance pattern at a tertiary care hospital in Egypt.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening bloodstream infection that occurs within the first 4 weeks of life and represents a significant cause of illness and death, especially in developing countries. Regular assessment of the local causative agents and their resistance patterns is important for effective management. This study aimed to determine the microbiological profile of neonatal sepsis and its antibiotic resistance patterns. METHODOLOGY: Our study was conducted on 237 neonates suspected of sepsis. Blood samples were collected and inoculated into BACT/ALERT blood culture bottles. Bacteria causing positive blood cultures were identified conventionally and confirmed to the species level using MALDI-TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns were identified using the disk diffusion method in combination with the VITEK(R) 2 compact system. Data analysis was performed using version 28 of SPSS software. RESULTS: The overall rate of neonatal sepsis was 33.8% (80/237). Of these, 54 (67.5%) and 26 (32.5%) were caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae 38 (47.5%) was the dominant causative pathogen, followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) 24 (30%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensively drug resistance (XDR) were detected in 82.5% and 10% respectively. An alarmingly high incidence of carbapenem-resistance (90.7%) was detected among Gram-negative bacteria. Methicillin resistance was detected in S. aureus and CoNS in 100% and 54.2%, respectively. Tigecycline was the most effective antibiotic for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that neonatal sepsis is mostly caused by MDR pathogens, predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae, urging revised empirical treatments and stricter infection control measures."
26407440,Actinomyces neuii Isolated From a 20-Month-Old Girl With Cervical Lymphadenitis.,2015,"Actinomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria that can be part of the normal human flora of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and genital tract. Infections are rare, slowly progressing and most commonly affect the cervicofacial region. Actinomyces israelii is the most frequently isolated species but a number of other species may cause infection. We report the first postnatally acquired case of an actinomycosis caused by A. neuii in a child. We also provide a systematic review of all published cases of A. neuii infections. In children, there is one case report of a premature infant with perinatally acquired A. neuii sepsis. In adults 21 cases have currently been reported and A. neuii infection was associated with endophthalmitis after eye surgery, foreign material-associated infection and abscess formation in the inguinal, axillary, and mammary area. Our case highlights that a A. neuii infection is also a potential differential diagnosis in children with chronic lymphadenitis."
32020974,Acute kidney injury in the pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary care hospital of the Armed Forces: a cross-sectional observational study.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is shown to be the commonest complication in critically ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification and definition are now used universally. We undertook prospective observational study to study the etiology and maximum stage of AKI as defined by KDIGO and its complications and outcomes. METHODS: All children admitted to the PICU were included in the study. The diagnosis of sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was made according to the standard international guidelines. The patients were followed up till discharge/death. All children were screened for AKI at admission and subsequently using serum creatinine measured by modified Jaffe's method and urine output measurement. RESULTS: A total of 197 children were admitted to the PICU. 38 (19.28%) developed AKI, and 6 (15.78%) developed stage III AKI. Malignancies, serious neurological and renal disorders, and postsurgery complications accounted for most of the cases with AKI. Six were admitted with primary renal condition. Sepsis with or without MODS was seen in 12 patients with AKI and in 8 without AKI. Twenty-one children with AKI and 3 children without AKI were exposed to nephrotoxic drugs. Twenty-three children with AKI required inotropic support. The average length of stay (ALOS) of children with AKI in the PICU was 9.86 days, whereas ALOS of children without AKI was 6.23 days. Eighteen children with AKI (47.36%) and 36 (21.38%) with no AKI died. CONCLUSIONS: AKI in children in the PICUs of referral hospitals in the armed forces have varied etiologies and presentations. These children require early identification and management with close monitoring to prevent long-term renal morbidity and mortality."
19966357,Mediastinal lymphadenopathy detected with an integrated positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic scan: a differential diagnosis to consider before minimally invasive staging.,2009,"Integrated positron emission tomography combined with plain computed tomography is commonly employed as the diagnostic tool for patients presenting with lung opacities. This technology is non-invasive and does not put the patient at risk of contrast reaction. We report a case of a man who presented with fever, septicaemia, and a left apical lung opacity on chest radiography. His positron emission tomography and plain computed tomography scans showed increased uptake by the left apical lung opacity together with a huge anterior mediastinal mass, suggestive of lung cancer with mediastinal lymph node involvement, and a right upper lobe shadow. After an initial futile bronchoscopy, an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the mediastinal node was planned but a contrast computed tomographic scan of the thorax revealed no significantly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The differential diagnoses of these findings, together with the limitations of positron emission tomography and plain computed tomography, are discussed."
20391743,[Risk factors and disposition in development of the nervous system infections].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Although well protected, brain is not resistant to infection agents. Acute infections of our nervous system appear more often in children and in persons who have medical history data about previous disorders, especially disorders of the nervous system. It is difficult to list possible risk factors which can be responsible for the appearance of infections of CNS and the resulting conditions. It is often difficult or impossible to determine what previous neural damage was (trauma, anoxic damages etc.) from those appearing during infections of CNS. All-inclusive anamnestic research reduces the possibility of approximate judgements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was based on the retrospective analysis of medical documentation of 275 patients. All patients were divided into three groups according to the final diagnosis. The first group consisted of 125 patients who were treated for acute virus encephalitis, the second group consisted of 125 patients who were treated for acute bacterial meningoencephalitis and the third group consisted of 25 patients who were treated for cerebritis. DISCUSSION: In our studies sample, the youngest patient was 3 years old and the oldest was 87 years old. The highest number of patients with virus infection of the CNS was in the group under 25 years of age (45.6%). The highest number of patients with bacterial infections of the CNS and cerebritis was in the group of patients over 45 years of age (64%, 37%). CONCLUSION: Risk factors were more present in bacterial infections of the nervous system and cerebrit than in virus infection of CNS. In virus infections of the CNS, 28% of patients had some risk factor, most often-chronic ethylism, diabetes mellitus and acquired heart diseases. In bacterial infections of the CNS, 64% of patients had some predisposed factor. The most frequent factor of risk in these patients were chronic otitis (21.6%) and cranio-trauma (14.4%). In cerebritis, risk factors were present in 76% of patients and they were: sepsis (20%), chronic otitis (12%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (8%)."
15724394,Recent approach for diagnosis of early HCV infection.,2004,"Detection of HCV infection during the window phase of infection, before seroconversion, is important in blood screening. However, a significant delay exists between the time of infection and the development of antibodies. The delay in window period can last up to 70 days. The aim of the present study was to investigate the kinetics of HCV markers during early infection, with detection of HCV core antigen as an early method for diagnosis. The study included determination of HCV RNA by qualitative and quantitative PCR, HCV core antigen detection by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and specific serological markers including anti-HCV IgG and IgM. The study was carried out on 34 patients diagnosed as non A non B acute hepatitis and proved to be hepatitis C by qualitative HCV RNA PCR. Sixteen healthy control subjects were also included. From each consenting patient and control, blood samples were collected and serum was separated and subjected to determination of AST and ALT and the following virological laboratory tests: HCV core antigen detection by ELISA, determination of specific anti-HCV IgM and specific anti-HCV IgG, qualitative and quantitative determination of HCV RNA by second version of PCR. In patients, the median quantity of HCV RNA was 739.1 x 10(3) lu/ml with minimum quantity 2.1 x 10(3) lu/ml and maximum 38352.3 x 10(3) lu/ml. A comparison between the different diagnostic methods revealed that the highest sensitivity was for HCV-core antigen detection (82.4%), specificity was 100% negative predictive value was 72.2% and positive predictive value was 100%. Specific anti-HCV IgG had moderate levels of sensitivity (58.5%), specificity (75%), negative predictive value (46.2%)and positive predictive value (83.3%). The least sensitive method was the specific anti-HCV IgM (29.4%) with negative predictive value 40% but had specificity and positive predictive value of 100% of each. From this study we could conclude the followings: From virological methods, serological detection of specific IgM anti-HCV had the least sensitivity limits, while it had the highest specificity and positive predictive value. Specific anti-HCV IgG had moderate sensitivity and specificity. The most sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis of early HCV viraemia was the detection of HCV core Ag by ELISA when compared to molecular biological methods."

Presented is a case of a 67-year-old man treated for 26 days with linezolid for staphylococcal osteomyelitis of the right foot with subsequent sepsis. During the course of treatment, severe lactic acidosis developed, requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The likely mechanism of this potentially life-threatening complication is discussed."
25658519,Blood culture series benefit may be limited to selected clinical conditions: time to reassess.,2015,"Blood cultures are often submitted as series (two to three sets per 24 hours) to maximize sample recovery. We assessed the actual benefit of additional sets. Blood cultures submitted from adults (>/= 18 years old) over 1 year (1 February 2012 to 31 January 2013) were examined. The medical records of patients with positive cultures were reviewed. Cultures with commensal organisms were considered contamination in the absence of a source and clinical findings. The impact of additional sets on antibiotic therapy was estimated. We evaluated 15,394 blood cultures. They were submitted as two to five sets per 24 hours in 12,236 (79.5%) instances. Pathogens were detected in 1227 sets, representing 741 bacteremias, of which 618 (83.4%) were detected in the first set and 123 (16.6%) in the additional sets. Pathogens missed in the first set were recovered from patients receiving antibiotics (n = 72; 58.5%) and after undergoing a procedure (n = 54; 43.9%). The additional sets' results could have influenced antibiotic therapy in 76/6235 (1.2%) instances, including 40 (0.6%) antibiotic switches and 36 (0.6%) possible extensions of therapy. The potential impact of the detection of missed pathogens on antibiotic therapy was not apparent in patients who had an endovascular infection (26/27, 96.3%) and those who lacked an obvious source of pathogens (10/10, 100%). These findings suggest that one blood culture is probably adequate in patients with an obvious source of pathogens. Blood culture series are beneficial in patients without an obvious source of pathogens and in those with endovascular infections. It is time to reassess the benefit of blood culture series, perhaps limiting them to selected conditions."
15907522,Serial changes in neutrophil-endothelial activation markers during the course of sepsis associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation.,2005,"INTRODUCTION: For systematic elucidation of serial changes in neutrophil-endothelial activation markers as well as to investigate the correlationship among the inflammation markers, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in patients with sepsis, we made this prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were subdivided into two groups, 27 with DIC and 18 without DIC. Eight normal healthy volunteers served as control subjects. Serial levels of soluble L-, P-, and E-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), thrombomodulin (sTM), and neutrophil elastase were measured within 12 h after the diagnosis of sepsis (day 0) and on days 1-4 after the diagnosis. The numbers of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria that patients met and the DIC score were determined simultaneously. RESULTS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was identical between the two groups. In the DIC patients, higher DIC scores, lower platelet counts, and more maximum numbers of SIRS criteria being met were observed compared with the non-DIC patients. The incidence of MODS and the number of the dysfunctioning organs were higher in the patients with DIC than those without DIC, and the DIC patients had poor outcome. Soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin) levels in both groups tended to be lower than those in the control subjects. All other parameters both in the two groups were continuously higher than those in the control subjects during study period. The levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, neutrophil elastase, and sTM were more elevated in the DIC patients than those in the non-DIC patients. There were no differences in the sP-selectin levels between the two groups; however, more increased sP-selectin levels per platelet were found in the DIC patients compared with the non-DIC patients. Maximum DIC scores in the DIC group positively correlated with the peak levels of neutrophil elastase and sTM and the number of the dysfunctioning organs. CONCLUSIONS: We found close relations among the neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions, DIC, and MODS in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. The results indirectly confirm the concept that DIC can produce organ dysfunction and that DIC reflects an inflammatory disorder of the microvasculature."
41658299,Investigation of invasive Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y ST1466 case increases in New York State.,2025,"Bacterial meningitis and septicemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention and prompt treatment. In the United States, cases of N. meningitidis serogroup Y increased sharply in 2023, leading to a CDC health advisory issued in March 2024, alerting public health agencies and healthcare providers of this surge. N. meningitidis serogroup Y is of particular concern because these strains demonstrate higher levels of resistance to the antimicrobials ciprofloxacin and penicillin. At the Wadsworth Center Bacteriology Laboratory (WCBL), all N. meningitidis isolates received are identified, serogroup determined by real-time PCR, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed. A subset of isolates undergo whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the multilocus sequence type (MLST), presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, and relatedness analysis for outbreak investigations. In this study, we sequenced all 36 N. meningitidis serogroup Y isolates received between 2018 and 2024, of which 20 (~55%) were determined to be sequence type (ST) 1466. We used multiple bioinformatic methods to characterize the relatedness of isolates received at WCBL and compared them with ST1466 isolates from the United States with publicly accessible genomes. We identified a cluster of 8 cases of ST1466 N. meningitidis from the same region of New York State (NYS) that included a known transmission event linked to sharing a cigarette. Cases in this cluster were comprised of predominantly unvaccinated, African American, non-Hispanic, males between 45 and 76 years old, and mostly presented with sepsis; a demographic and clinical presentation not typical of those affected by N. meningitidis in the United States. Comparisons with publicly available genomes from ST1466 N. meningitidis strains from across the country showed that relatedness methods that mask genomic regions showing recombination signatures can obscure the diversity among these strains. This study, which importantly includes a case of known recent transmission, highlights the need to revisit genomic relatedness estimation and thresholds for defining relatedness in N. meningitidis. Our results also illuminate the importance of surveillance and characterization of N. meningitidis for future prevention and treatment, and the increased resolution that WGS provides to surveillance efforts."
25516454,Association between early peak temperature and mortality in neutropenic sepsis.,2015,"Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection, but its prognostic impact has not been established. We aimed to determine whether early peak temperature is associated with mortality in patients with neutropenic sepsis admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). We used a database of admissions to 157 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand between 2005 and 2013 to seek an association between peak temperature within the first 24 h in ICU and in-hospital mortality in neutropenic and non-neutropenic sepsis. Odds ratios for in-hospital death were calculated for four temperature bands, adjusting for illness severity. Two patient cohorts were identified: neutropenic sepsis (N = 4027) and non-neutropenic sepsis (N = 114,040). In-hospital mortality was higher in neutropenic sepsis than non-neutropenic sepsis. In both cohorts, early peak temperature below 36.5  degrees C was associated with significantly increased mortality compared to normothermia. Among non-neutropenic patients, an early peak temperature of 37.5  degrees C or higher was associated with reduced mortality compared to normothermia. In contrast, in patients with neutropenic sepsis, fever was not associated with reduced mortality compared to normothermia. Similar findings were seen in a subgroup of the neutropenic sepsis cohort with a documented haematological malignancy. In neutropenic sepsis patients admitted to ICU, a temperature below 36.5  degrees C is associated with increased mortality compared with normothermia. In contrast to non-neutropenic sepsis, fever was not associated with a significant reduction in mortality in neutropenic patients. Interventional studies are needed to determine whether physical or pharmacological measures to reduce fever influence outcomes during neutropenic infections."
31826260,Current Controversies in Sepsis Management.,2019,"The overarching goals of early sepsis management include early recognition, appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control, maintenance of hemodynamic stability, and supportive care of organ dysfunction. Despite increasing awareness of the global burden of sepsis, and general agreement on the goals of management, there is ongoing controversy regarding the implementation of specific treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes. This article will address five current points of controversy in the management of sepsis and septic shock. These include optimal timing of antibiotics in patients with potential sepsis, the role of glucocorticoids in septic shock, vitamin C as a novel therapy for sepsis, the ideal intravenous fluid for resuscitation, and the optimal balance of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration in septic shock. For each of these topics, we review relevant literature, discuss areas of controversy, and present our current approach to management."
41636191,Predictive value of dynamic plasma biomarkers for clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome; data on early biomarker kinetics and their link to severity are scarce. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 80 children with sepsis (March 2022 - June 2024). C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and D-dimer were measured at admission (T0), 72 hours (T1) later and on Day 7 (T2). Disease severity was assessed using the pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA); length of stay (LOS) was recorded. Baseline values, Day 7 levels, and changes Delta(T2-T0) were correlated with pSOFA and LOS. RESULTS: Baseline inflammatory profiles differed by etiology: median CRP and PCT on admission were roughly doubled in bacterial versus viral disease, while IL‑6 was highest in respiratory and abdominal infections. Nevertheless, all six markers decreased significantly over seven days (p </= 0.015) and the proportional declines were uniform across pathogens or foci (interaction p > 0.18). Higher admission CRP, PCT, IL‑6 and D‑dimer modestly correlated with greater organ dysfunction (r </= 0.55), whereas steeper week‑long falls in the same markers tracked with larger pSOFA improvement (r = -0.41 to -0.53; all p </= 0.002). SAA showed a weaker inverse association (r = -0.32, p = 0.008), whereas the decline in ESR was not significant. A pragmatic two‑step algorithm (admission CRP  >/= 60 mg/L, PCT  >/= 3 ng/mL, IL‑6  >/= 200 pg/mL or D‑dimer  >/= 1.5 mg/L; plus a >/= 50% drop in IL‑6 or PCT within 72 h) identified children who ultimately required intensive care unit (ICU) care or stayed >/= 7 days with an area‑under‑the‑curve of 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Both initial elevations and early declines in CRP, PCT, IL-6 and D-dimer mirror organ dysfunction and hospitalization duration in pediatric sepsis. Serial monitoring of these readily available markers may improve early risk stratification and guide therapy."
15671757,Temporary CD8+ T-cell depletion in pigs does not exacerbate infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).,2004,"Several studies have demonstrated a consistent increase in the CD8+ T-cell subset of pigs following infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV). Consequently, it has been suggested that CD8+ T-cells may play an important role in protection against this infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined five 5-week-old pigs, which had been depleted for CD8+ T-cells by treatment with anti-CD8 mAb injections, starting 2 days before inoculation with PRRSV. Virus-inoculated and sham-inoculated age-matched pigs served as controls. Blood samples were collected continuously, together with organ material at necropsy, to study kinetics of leukocyte subpopulations, antibody production and virus persistence in individual pigs. Significant lower CD8+ T-cell counts on day 0, that is, before virus challenge, in the anti-CD8 mAb treated pigs compared to the control pigs, confirmed the depletion effect of specific mAb therapy. Almost complete depletion of cell subsets expressing the CD8+ antigen was obtained on day 2 and 5 post infection (PI) with nadir less than 1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). One week PI, an increase in T-cell subsets was observed for both anti-CD8 mAb treated pigs and virus-inoculated control pigs. T-memory cells and cytotoxic T-cells reached levels comparative with the virus-inoculated control pigs on days 8 and 12 PI, respectively, whereas NKcells remained suppressed for the rest of the experimental period. An extraordinary increase of T-helper cells in the anti-CD8 mAb treated pigs with a significantly higher level than in the virus-inoculated and sham-inoculated control pigs, was observed from day 12 PI. In conclusion, it was established that CD8+ T-cell depletion in the early phase of PRRSV infection neither caused increased disease nor influenced the ability to clear virus in the treated pigs."
31883971,A novel method to detect bacterial infection in premature infants: Using a combination of inflammatory markers in blood and saliva.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infection leads to high morbidity and mortality in premature babies due to their immature immune system. Biomarkers in blood have been reported to detect bacterial infection in neonates. However, serial blood exams pose iatrogenic anemia in premature babies. Thus, this study aimed to identify cytokines in saliva, which can help to diagnose bacterial infection in premature babies via a non-invasive method. METHODS: Premature neonates were enrolled from Aug. 2012 to Feb. 2015 after completing informed consent. Babies with congenital anomalies, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis and any surgical indicated diseases were excluded. Salivary samples collection and septic work-up were performed when bacterial infection was clinically suspected, as well as one week after antimicrobial treatment. The level of salivary cytokines was detected by MILLPLEX(R) MAP and analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 16 episodes of bacterial infection in 10 cases. Culture-positive group had significantly higher levels of salivary Interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1alpha, MIP-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha than that in the culture-negative group (p = 0.002, 0.006, 0.001, <0.001, 0.009), and blood C-reactive protein and sugar as well (p < 0.001, 0.026). After adjusting postmenstrual age by logistic regression, blood sugar level was the most significant biomarker (p = 0.019). In combination of blood and salivary biomarkers, blood sugar higher than 67 mg/dL and salivary IL-6 higher than 367.25 pg/mL concurrently, would accurately detect bacterial infection in premature babies. CONCLUSION: This non-invasive method might help us to accurately diagnose bacterial infection in premature babies."
31847927,Risk factors for adverse events within one year after atrial septal closure in children: a retrospective follow-up study.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Secundum atrial septal defect is one of the most common congenital heart defects. Previous paediatric studies have mainly addressed echocardiographic and few clinical factors among children associated with adverse events. The aim of this study was to identify neonatal and other clinical risk factors associated with adverse events up to one year after closure of atrial septal defect. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study includes children born in Sweden between 2000 and 2014 that were treated surgically or percutaneously for an atrial septal defect. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between major and minor adverse events and potential risk factors, adjusting for confounding factors including prematurity, neonatal sepsis, neonatal general ventilatory support, symptomatic atrial septal defects, and pulmonary hypertension. RESULTS: Overall, 396 children with 400 atrial septal defect closures were included. The median body weight at closure was 14.5 (3.5-110) kg, and the median age was 3.0 (0.1-17.8) years. Overall, 110 minor adverse events and 68 major events were recorded in 87 and 49 children, respectively. Only symptomatic atrial septal defects were associated with both minor (odds ratio (OR) = 2.18, confidence interval (CI) 95% 1.05-8.06) and major (OR = 2.80 CI 95% 1.23-6.37) adverse events. CONCLUSION: There was no association between the investigated neonatal comorbidities and major or minor events after atrial septal defect closure. Patients with symptomatic atrial septal defects had a two to four times increased risk of having a major event, suggesting careful management and follow-up of these children prior to and after closure."
25537537,[Clinical analysis of 165 extremely low birth weight infants].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features and prognosis of extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI). METHOD: Data of totally 165 hospitalized ELBWI between August 1st, 2008 and November 30th, 2013 in Hunan Children's Hospital were analyzed. The information of general data and births, prenatal care, delivery room stabilization, transfer information, complications, treatment, outcome and follow up were summarized. RESULT: (1) One hundred and sixty-five ELBWI were involved, their mean gestational age was (28.4+/-2.4) weeks, mean birth weight(910.9+/-93.1) g. (2) Rate of delivery in tertiary hospital was 46.7% (77/165) and prenatal steroids exposure was found in 52.1% (86/165). None of the cases were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in delivery room. (3) Rate of infants who were transfered to the class III b neonatal ward within 12 hours after birth was 58.8% (97/165). (4) The main complications of them included neonatal respiratory distress syndrome(NRDS, 77.0%, 127/165), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 70.1%, 75/107), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 50.0%, 40/80), preterm retinopathy (ROP, 43.0%, 46/107), sepsis 39.4% (65/165), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH, 34.8%, 49/141), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, 8.0%, 7/88). (5) TREATMENT: 97.6% (161/165) received oxygen therapy and 66.1% (109/165) received mechanical ventilation, 55.2% (91/165) used CPAP. 89.8% (114/127) of the NRDS used PS; 44.0% (33/75) of the BPD used low dose dexamethasone, 32.0% (24/75) used low dose nitric oxide; 60.0% (24/40) of the PDA used medication. 32.6% (15/46) of the ROP received laser photocoagulation. The average time of beginning enteral feeding was 2.0 d, the mean time to achieve full gastrointestinal feeding was 43.4 d. (6) OUTCOME: rate of survival in 165 cases with ELBWI was 51.5% (85/165), treatment was abandoned in 37.6% (62/165), total mortality was 48.5% (80/165). There were significant difference in survival rate between different birth weight group, gestational age group and admission age group (chi2=11.498, 8.789, 13.157, all P<0.05); There was significant difference in rate of giving up treatment between different birth weight and admission age groups (chi2=10.448, 8.259, all P<0.05). The primary cause of death was economic factor and worrying about prognosis. (7) Follow up: rate of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in part of follow up cases was 27.9% (12/43). CONCLUSION: ELBWI have many severe complications and sequelae, which need complex treatment and long hospital stay with a low survival rate. In order to improve the level of treatment, we need to improve the rate of prenatal steroids, carry out intrauterine and postnatal, transport of ELBWI to III b neonatal ward as early and rationally as possible, give professional, sophisticated and integrated treatment technologies as far as possible."
20014610,Thyroid storm presenting as intra-abdominal sepsis with multi-organ failure requiring intensive care.,2009,"Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening condition manifesting with several clinical presentations. Atypical thyroid storm should be part of the differential diagnosis in patients with multiple organ dysfunction of unknown aetiology. In this case report, delayed recognition of thyroid storm in a young female who presented with acute abdomen increased the risk of poor outcome. Prompt initiation of anti-thyroid therapy once the diagnosis of thyroid storm was established, combined with adequate vital organ support using a goal-directed therapy protocol in the intensive care unit resulted in a good outcome."
25552512,"[Peptide-agonist of protease-activated receptor (PAR 1), similar to activated protein C, promotes proliferation in keratinocytes and wound healing of epithelial layer].",2014,"Activated protein C (APC) is serine protease hemostasis, independent of its anticoagulant activity, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties that determine the possibility of the protective effects of APC in different diseases, including sepsis and chronic wound healing. APC, binding of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and specifically cleaving PAR1 receptor and releasing peptide agonist PAR1 stabilizes not only endothelial cells, but also many others, including epidermal keratinocytes of the skin. We develop the hypothesis that the cytoprotective effect of APC on the cells, involved in wound healing, seem to imitate peptide - analogous of PAR1 ""tethered ligand"" that activate PAR1. In our work, we synthesized a peptide (AP9) - analogue of PAR1 tethered ligand, released by APC, and firstly showed that peptide AP9 (0.1-10 small em, CyrillicM), like to APC (0.01-100 nM), stimulates the proliferative activity of human primary keratinocytes. Using a model of the formation of epithelial wounds in vitro we found that peptide AP9, as well as protease APC, accelerates wound healing. Using specific antibodies to the receptor PAR1 and EPCR was studied the receptor mechanism of AP9 action in wound healing compared with the action of APcapital ES, Cyrillic. The necessity of both receptors - PAR1 and EPcapital ES, CyrillicR, for proliferative activity of agonists was revealed. Identified in our work imitation by peptide AP9 - PAR1 ligand, APC acts on keratinocytes suggests the possibility of using a peptide AP9 to stimulate tissue repair."
20002683,Detection of candidaemia in patients with and without underlying haematological disease.,2010,"Diagnosing candidaemia remains difficult despite the development of new diagnostics. We report a direct comparison of three different blood-culture systems and four indirect tests. One hundred and fourteen episodes either with haematological disease and fever despite antibacterials, or with documented invasive candidiasis, were enrolled prospectively. Clinical, para-clinical information and surveillance cultures were obtained. Blood culture was performed using conventional blood-culture bottles, mycosis bottles, and the Isolator 10 lysis centrifugation system. Serum D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol (DA/LA) ratios were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Antigen, mannan-antigen (Ag) and anti-mannan antibody (Ab) were detected by CandTec, Platelia Candida Ag ELISA and Candida AB/AC/AK kits, respectively. Episodes were classified as proven (n = 24), probable (n = 14), possible (n = 52) or unlikely (n = 24) invasive candidiasis. Candidaemia involved C. albicans (17), C. albicans + C. glabrata (3), C. tropicalis (1) and yeast (1). Mycosis bottles yielded two additional positives and the conventional blood culture yielded one positive not identified by other blood-culture methods. Considering proven and unlikely episodes, respectively, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: mannan-Ag and/or anti-mannan Ab: 83.3%, 78.3%; DA/LA ratio: 41.7%, 86.4%; and CandTec Candida Ag: 66.6%, 70.8%. Lowering the cut-off values to mannan-Ag 0.10 ng/mL and anti-mannan Ab 4 AU/mL, the values were: 100%, 73.9%. Applying the DA/LA ratio to only patients with haematological neutropenia the values were: 75%, 90.5%. Fungal blood culture allowed slightly improved detection of candidaemia. The best indirect test performance was obtained from combined mannan-Ag and anti-mannan Ab detection, especially with lower cut-offs. DA/LA ratio appears to be useful in the context of haematological neutropenia."

Incomplete dental extractions had been performed 10-days earlier During a second dental procedure, 22 tooth root remnants were removed. Diabetic ketoacidosis and possible thromboembolism complicated the cat's recovery period After 13-days of hospitalization, the patient was stable enough to be sent home. Postoperative examinations at 1, 3, 6, 12, 16, 24, and 52-weeks indicated continued improvement with moderate glycemic control and chronic but stable renal failure. The patient died from further complications of diabetic ketoacidosis 20-months following root remnant extractions."
15579727,Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor as a potential novel biomarker in acute lung injury.,2005,"Although the pathogenic and genetic basis of acute lung injury (ALI) remains incompletely understood, the identification of novel ALI biomarkers holds promise for unique insights. Expression profiling in animal models of ALI (canine and murine) and human ALI detected significant expression of pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a gene not previously associated with lung pathophysiology. These results were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry studies, with PBEF protein levels significantly increased in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of ALI models and in cytokine- or cyclic stretch-activated lung microvascular endothelium. We genotyped two PBEF single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a well characterized sample of white patients with sepsis-associated ALI, patients with severe sepsis, and healthy subjects and observed that carriers of the haplotype GC from SNPs T-1001G and C-1543T had a 7.7-fold higher risk of ALI (95% confidence interval 3.01-19.75, p < 0.001). The T variant from the SNP C-1543T resulted in a significant decrease in the transcription rate (1.8-fold; p < 0.01) by the reporter gene assay. Together, these results strongly indicate that PBEF is a potential novel biomarker in ALI and demonstrate the successful application of robust genomic technologies in the identification of candidate genes in complex lung disease."
20301287,Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), caused by defective lymphocyte homeostasis, is characterized by the following: Non-malignant lymphoproliferation (lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with or without hypersplenism) that often improves with age. Autoimmune disease, mostly directed toward blood cells. Lifelong increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In ALPS-FAS (the most common and best-characterized type of ALPS, associated with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in FAS), non-malignant lymphoproliferation typically manifests in the first years of life, inexplicably waxes and wanes, and then often decreases without treatment in the second decade of life; in many affected individuals, however, neither splenomegaly nor the overall expansion of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood decreases. Although autoimmunity is often not present at the time of diagnosis or at the time of the most extensive lymphoproliferation, autoantibodies can be detected before autoimmune disease manifests clinically. In ALPS-FAS caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous (biallelic) pathogenic variants in FAS, severe lymphoproliferation occurs before, at, or shortly after birth, and usually results in death at an early age. ALPS-sFAS, resulting from somatic FAS pathogenic variants in selected cell populations, notably the alpha/beta double-negative T cells (alpha/beta-DNT cells), appears to be similar to ALPS-FAS resulting from heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in FAS, although lower incidence of splenectomy and lower lymphocyte counts have been reported in ALPS-sFAS and no cases of lymphoma have yet been published. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ALPS is based on the following: Clinical findings. Laboratory abnormalities: Abnormal biomarker testing (soluble interleukin-10 [IL-10], Fas ligand [FasL], IL-18, and vitamin B(12)). Defective in vitro tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas)-mediated apoptosis. T cells that express the alpha/beta T-cell receptor but lack both CD4 and CD8 (so-called ""alpha/beta-DNT cells""). Identification of pathogenic variants in genes relevant for the Fas pathway of apoptosis. These genes include FAS (either germline or somatic pathogenic variants), CASP10, and FASLG. Up to 20% of those with clinical ALPS have not had a genetic etiology identified. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Current management is focused on monitoring for and treatment of lymphoproliferation, hypersplensim, and lymphomas and management of cytopenias and other autoimmune diseases. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy do not decrease lymphadenopathy long term and are generally reserved for severe complications of lymphoproliferation (e.g., airway obstruction, significant hypersplenism associated with splenomegaly) and/or autoimmune manifestations. Experience with sirolimus suggests that it is the preferred agent in treating lymphoproliferation in a more sustained manner, including maintenance of remission following a period of discontinued use of sirolimus; however, sirolimus is not without side effects. Lymphoma is treated with conventional protocols. Autoimmune cytopenias and other autoimmune diseases are typically treated by immune suppression with corticosteroids as well as corticosteroid-sparing agents if prolonged treatment of autoimmune cytopenias is required and/or in cases of refractory cytopenias. Splenectomy is reserved as an option of last resort in the treatment of life-threatening refractory cytopenias and/or severe hypersplenia because of the high risk of recurrence of cytopenias and sepsis post-splenectomy in persons with ALPS. Prevention of primary manifestations: Bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cell) transplantation (BMT/HSCT), the only curative treatment for ALPS, has to date mostly been performed on those with severe clinical phenotypes such as ALPS-FAS caused by biallelic pathogenic variants, those with severe and/or refractory autoimmune cytopenias, those with lymphoma, and those who have developed complications from (often long-term) immunosuppressive therapy. Prevention of secondary complications: Vaccinations pre-splenectomy (with consideration of post-splenectomy boost vaccinations) and penicillin prophylaxis are strongly recommended for individuals who undergo splenectomy. Surveillance: Clinical assessment and imaging and laboratory studies for manifestations of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity; specialized imaging studies to detect malignant transformation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Splenectomy is discouraged as it typically does not lead to permanent remission of autoimmunity and is associated with increased risk of infection. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used with caution in individuals with immune thrombocytopenia as they can interfere with platelet function. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in a family member with ALPS, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on at-risk relatives to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy management: Assessment of the risks and benefits of treating a woman who has ALPS with corticosteroids, mycophenylate mofitil, or sirolimus during pregnancy must take into consideration the potential teratogenic risks to the fetus. GENETIC COUNSELING: Inheritance of ALPS-CASP10, most cases of ALPS-FAS, and some cases of ALPS-FASLG is autosomal dominant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant ALPS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Inheritance of most cases of ALPS-FASLG and severe ALPS associated with biallelic FAS pathogenic variants is autosomal recessive. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive ALPS are likely to be heterozygotes, in which case each has one FAS pathogenic variant; these parents may have ALPS-related findings or may be clinically asymptomatic. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member. ALPS-FAS can also be the result of somatic mosaicism. Somatic pathogenic variants have not been reported in ALPS-FASLG or ALPS-CASP10 to date."
41438721,Maternal Listeriosis Presenting With Suspected Meningitis in Late Pregnancy: A Case Report.,2025,"Maternal listeriosis is uncommon but clinically important due to the risk of severe maternal illness and adverse perinatal outcomes. Nonspecific symptoms often overlap with viral and respiratory illnesses, delaying diagnosis. We describe the case of a 28-year-old gravida 4 para 2+1 at 29+5 weeks who presented with fever, frontal headache, photophobia, and generalized myalgias. Significant medical history included asthma, chronic hypertension, chronic hepatitis B and C carriage, and a sickle cell variant. Blood cultures grew Listeria monocytogenes. She was treated with intravenous amoxicillin and gentamicin after initial empiric therapy. Despite concern for central nervous system involvement, brain MRI revealed no intracranial pathology. She transitioned to benzylpenicillin for outpatient therapy and achieved complete recovery. A healthy infant was delivered by emergency caesarean section at 39+1 weeks. Maternal listeriosis can closely mimic common viral illnesses. Thus, maintaining a high index of suspicion, especially in pregnant women with nonspecific febrile symptoms, can facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment, which is essential to optimising maternal and neonatal outcomes."
19939858,Postmortem candidaemia: marker of disseminated disease.,2010,"AIM: The significance of finding Candida species in heart blood cultures obtained at postmortem examination has never been studied. This article describes the findings of autopsy patients with postmortem candidaemia and it compares them with findings in autopsy patients with antemortem candidaemia. METHOD: 23 patients with Candida species isolated from heart blood at autopsy were identified over a 10-year period. These patients were compared with 10 autopsy patients found during the same time period with antemortem blood cultures isolating Candida species, but not positive postmortem heart blood cultures. Antemortem and postmortem records were reviewed. RESULTS: All 23 patients with Candida species isolated from postmortem blood culture had one or more antemortem risk factors for disseminated candidiasis, such as positive antemortem blood cultures, isolation of Candida from sterile internal sites, neutropenia, recent abdominal surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic administration or the use of central venous catheters or other invasive devices. Eight patients showed histological proof of invasive candidiasis in addition to the positive heart blood cultures. This group did not differ with respect to risk factors from 10 autopsy patients with disseminated candidiasis and antemortem blood cultures with Candida species. However, all the patients with antemortem candidaemia had histological evidence of disseminated candidiasis at autopsy. CONCLUSION: Candidaemia, when documented by heart blood culture performed at autopsy or by antemortem blood culture, is an insensitive, but highly specific, indicator of disseminated candidiasis."
25634073,"Candidemia-induced pediatric sepsis and its association with free radicals, nitric oxide, and cytokine level in host.",2015,"Candida species has become the seventh most frequent causal microorganisms of nosocomial sepsis. Prematurity and low birth weights are strongly associated with the development of neonatal nosocomial bloodstream infections. Candida albicans has been the species most often associated with neonatal infections, but recently, there has been a changing pattern in the isolates recovered from neonates with invasive candidiasis, which poses resistance to the existing class of azoles such as fluconazole antifungals along with cross resistance to newer triazoles, which results in a therapeutic challenge in invasive fungal infections causing high incidence of mortality. Candida species was isolated from blood of neonates and children younger than 15 years admitted to hospital and susceptible for Candida-induced sepsis. Polymerase chain reaction-based identification and confirmation of individual Candida species were done using DNA sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility assay and resistance pattern for fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin were done for all the isolates. Furthermore, the change in free radical, cytokine release, and nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from control and pediatric sepsis cases were also performed. The present study probably for the first time reports the change in increasing incidence of nonalbicans Candida-induced sepsis in neonates and children admitted to the intensive care unit of hospital, and current antibiotics load posing resistance for antifungal treatment strategy and provide serious threats in future treatment. The increase in free radicals in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and increase in expression of nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release in Candida-infected pediatric sepsis cases underlie the role of host factor in dissemination and invasiveness of infection from exogenous sources and pathogenesis of systemic inflammation during sepsis."

25512311,Bright fluorescent Streptococcus pneumoniae for live-cell imaging of host-pathogen interactions.,2015,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common nasopharyngeal resident in healthy people but, at the same time, one of the major causes of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. The shift from commensal to pathogen and its interaction with host cells are poorly understood. One of the major limitations for research on pneumococcal-host interactions is the lack of suitable tools for live-cell imaging. To address this issue, we developed a generally applicable strategy to create genetically stable, highly fluorescent bacteria. Our strategy relies on fusing superfolder green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a far-red fluorescent protein (RFP) to the abundant histone-like protein HlpA. Due to efficient translation and limited cellular diffusion of these fusions, the cells are 25-fold brighter than those of the currently best available imaging S. pneumoniae strain. These novel bright pneumococcal strains are fully virulent, and the GFP reporter can be used for in situ imaging in mouse tissue. We used our reporter strains to study the effect of the polysaccharide capsule, a major pneumococcal virulence factor, on different stages of infection. By dual-color live-cell imaging experiments, we show that unencapsulated pneumococci adhere significantly better to human lung epithelial cells than encapsulated strains, in line with previous data obtained by classical approaches. We also confirm with live-cell imaging that the capsule protects pneumococci from neutrophil phagocytosis, demonstrating the versatility and usability of our reporters. The described imaging tools will pave the way for live-cell imaging of pneumococcal infection and help further understanding of the mechanisms of pneumococcal pathogenesis."
31836303,The diagnostic roles of neutrophil in bloodstream infections.,2020,"Bloodstream infections remain a leading cause of death worldwide, despite advances in critical care and understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies. No specific biomarkers or therapy are available for these conditions. Neutrophils play a critical role in controlling infection and it is suggested that their migration and antimicrobial activity are impaired during sepsis which contribute to the dysregulation of immune responses. Recent studies further demonstrated that interruption or reversal of the impaired migration and antimicrobial function of neutrophils improves the outcome of sepsis in animal models. In this review, we provide an overview of the associated diagnostic biomarkers involved neutrophils in sepsis, and discuss the potential of neutrophils as a target to specifically predict the outcome of sepsis."

It was stated that pathogenesis of visceral functions mainly expressed as a splanchnic blood circulation disturbance, massive translocation of gut organisms in portal bloodstream and the functional liver insufficiency particularly marked as form of macrophage liver insufficiency. The complex program of liver rehabilitation should be included in standards of treatment of the patients with diffuse peritonitis. It should be based on preventive measures of the enteral detoxication and microbial decontamination of small intestine and at the same time the intraportal transsubilical infusion correcting therapy has to be applied."
31918193,Kernel density estimates for sepsis classification.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Severe sepsis is a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, mortality, and cost. systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ failure due to infection define it, but also make it hard to diagnose. Early diagnosis reduces morbidity, mortality and cost, and diagnosis is often significantly delayed due to a lack of effective biomarkers. This research employs kernel density estimation (KDE) methods fusing a personalized, model-based insulin sensitivity (SI) metric with standard bedside measures of: temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and SIRS, as these measures are available hourly or more frequently. METHODS: Model-based SI is a derived metric, identified using clinical data and a clinically validated metabolic model. The KDE classifier discriminates severe sepsis and septic shock from moderate sepsis using accepted consensus sepsis scores. A best case in-sample estimate, a worst case independent cross validation estimate, and an accepted .632 bootstrap estimate are calculated to assess performance using multi-level likelihood ratios, and sensitivity and specificity. Performance is assessed against clinically and statistically defined thresholds denoted for the minimum acceptable level as: ""high accuracy, often providing useful information, and clinical significance,"" and similar definitions for greater or lesser quality. RESULTS: The .632 bootstrap estimate performs near clinically defined levels of high accuracy, often providing useful information, and clinical significance based on sensitivity, specificity, and multilevel likelihood ratios. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The classifier created and this overall approach is useful for clinical decision making in diagnosing severe sepsis and septic shock in real time, for both case and control hours. However, improvements could be made with larger clinical data sets."
20234746,Malaria parasitaemia among pregnant women in a rural community of eastern Nigeria; need for combined measures.,2009,"Malaria in pregnancy is a major contributor to adverse maternal and perinatal outcome. In hyper endemic areas like ours, it is a common cause of anaemia in pregnancy in both immune and non-immune individuals and is aggravated by poor socioeconomic circumstances. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia among pregnant women in a rural setting. 272 pregnant women, aged between 18 and 40 years in some remote rural areas of Ebonyi State, Nigeria were recruited between January 2007 and March 2008.Their blood samples were collected and examined for malaria parasite, haemoglobin and packed cell volume using standard methods. Our results showed 59.9% prevalence of parasitaemia with the highest prevalence occurring in the first trimester [84.1%]. Among the positive cases, mild parasitaemia was recorded in 47.2% moderate parasitaemia in 37.4% while severe parasitaemia was recorded in 15.3% of cases. These differences were statistically significant [P<0.016]. Furthermore the distribution of malaria densities in different gravidity groups showed an inverse relationship, 45.4% in primigravidae, [31.9%] in secundigravidae and [10.4%] among people with more than five pregnancies. These findings were statistically significant [P<0.0001]. The prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy in this study was 62.4%. Apart from the use of nets, drugs and vector control, the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in very poor socioeconomic settings should make provision for nutritional support."
15678205,Paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts in infancy--experience of a tertiary center.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholestasis secondary to paucity of bile duct is an alteration of the anatomic integrity of the biliary tract. Can be defined only histologically and, clinically, two categories are recognized: syndromic and non-syndromic, where the prognosis is generally more severe. AIM: To evaluate the history, clinical and biochemical characteristics, etiology and improvement of children who have paucity of intrahepatic bile duct followed at tertiary center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven children with paucity of intrahepatic bile duct, followed at the Pediatric Hepatology Service of the University Hospital, Campinas, SP, Brazil, were evaluated in the period from 1986 to 2001. RESULTS: Among the patients, three presented the syndromic and eight the non-syndromic form (two with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, one with lues, one secondary to sepsis, three with probable etiology by cytomegalovirus and one without a definite etiology). Referral ranged from 31 to 1185 days. Birth weights ranged from 1920 g to 3590 g. Most of the patients presented pale stools. The median bile duct/portal tract ratio was 0.14. The majority of the children presented a favorable follow-up, regardless of the form of presentation. CONCLUSION: Paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts should be considered in children with cholestasis and its differentiation from extrahepatic causes of neonatal cholestasis is important in order to avoid surgery. Diagnosis of non-syndromic form should not be regarded as unfavorable prognosis, as the evolution is probably related to the etiology in this form of presentation."
31999569,Fiber optic nanogold-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of procalcitonin at femtomolar concentration level.,2020,"A rapid and ultrasensitive biosensing method based on fiber optic nanogold-linked immunosorbent assay is reported. The method employs an immobilized capture probe on the fiber core surface of an optical fiber and a detection probe conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in a solution. Introduction of a sample containing an analyte and the detection probe into a biosensor chip leads to the formation of a sandwich-like complex of capture probe-analyte-detection probe on the fiber core surface, through which nanoplasmonic absorption of the fiber optic evanescent wave occurs. The performance of this method has been evaluated by its application to the detection of procalcitonin (PCT), an important biomarker for sepsis. In this study, anti-PCT capture antibody is functionalized on an unclad segment of an optical fiber to yield a fiber sensor and anti-PCT detection antibody is conjugated to AuNPs to afford nanoplasmonic probes. The method provides a wide linear response range from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL (5 orders) and an extremely low limit of detection of 95 fg/mL (7.3 fM) for PCT. In addition, the method shows a good correlation in determining PCT in blood plasma with the clinically validated electrochemiluninescent immunoassay. Furthermore, the method is quick (analysis time </=15 min), requires low-cost instrumentation and sensor chips, and is also potentially applicable to the detection of many other biomarkers."
20016190,Timing of group B streptococcus screening in pregnancy: a systematic review.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Group B streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of neonatal sepsis. Guidelines advise to collect cultures at 35-37 weeks' gestation and to administer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in case of GBS-positive cultures, as well as in all preterm deliveries. Improved effectiveness of antenatal cultures might help to further decrease GBS early-onset disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the best timing of antenatal cultures, which may help establish optimal prevention of perinatal GBS infection in both term and preterm neonates. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles published from 1966 to February 2009. Nine articles were included. Information about study features and predictive values of antenatal cultures were abstracted. RESULTS: Positive predictive values for antenatal GBS cultures ranged from 43 to 100% (mean 69%) and negative predictive values from 80 to 100% (mean 94%). GBS cultures collected in late pregnancy had high positive predictive values for colonization during delivery. The negative predictive value was high and relatively constant regardless of GA. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review confirms recommendations to screen pregnant women for colonization of GBS at 35-37 weeks' gestation, but one should be aware of the limitations of screening, with 6% of GBS carriers remaining undetected in antenatal cultures."

17304741,"The clinical spectrum of severe malaria in children in the east provincial hospital of Bertoua, Cameroon.",2004,"Severe malaria claims 1.5 to 2.7 million lives annually most of which are young children in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa. We retrospectively reviewed the files of 387 patients, admitted and treated for severe malaria according to WHO guidelines, in the Bertoua provincial hospital, a peripheral health center in East Cameroon from 1st October 1998 to 30h October 2000. Our main objective was to study the epidemiological aspects, clinical presentation and outcome. The mean age was 2.7 years (range 2 months - 15 years) among them 214 males and 173 females giving a sex ratio of 1.2. Transmission was observed all year round at variable frequencies with peaks in the rainy seasons. Major symptoms were fever in 202 patients (52.2%), convulsions in 150 (38.8%), prostration in 79 (20.4%) and persistent vomiting in 78 patients (20.2%). Major clinical findings were severe pallor in 196 patients (50.6%) and splenomegaly in 75 patients (19.4%). The average time between onset of symptoms and consultation was 4.4 days (range 1 - 21 days). Blood smears were positive for Plasmodium falciparum in 288 patients (74.4%) and negative in 99 (25.6%). Concerning outcome, recovery was observed in 317 patients (81.9%), interruption of treatment (because of financial constraints) in 58 (15%) and 12 deaths (3.8%). Among the 317 patients who recovered, neurological sequelae were observed in six patients, blindness in four patients and deafness in three patients were the most frequent. We conclude that severe malaria constitutes a major challenge of early diagnosis together with implementation of appropriate treatment especially in rural areas. The use of WHO guidelines in the management of this disease and the recommended preventive measures of vector control have yielded good results in patients managed and followed up in our hospital."
15584991,Detection of free hepatitis C virus core antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is not suitable for screening of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized hematopoietic progenitor donors.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who are negative for the presence of anti-HCV and serum HCV RNA. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of HCV viremia in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) donors by the use of a free HCV core antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 samples from consecutive PBPC donors that were mobilized with G-CSF, and 13 samples from patients presenting with leukocytosis of greater than 20 x 10(9) per L from other causes, were tested by a free HCV core antigen ELISA. Positive samples were confirmed by use of neutralization assays. The specificity of the assay was studied in 48,911 healthy blood donors negative for the presence of anti-HCV. RESULTS: The free HCV core antigen assay showed a 46.4 percent positivity in PBPC donors mobilized with G-CSF and 61.5 percent in patients exhibiting leukocytosis in the absence of G-CSF treatment. All the samples were found to be false-positive samples, and those related with growth factor treatment did not react when G-CSF was discontinued. Overall specificity by the test in freshly collected blood donor specimens was 99.62 percent. CONCLUSION: Data indicate that the free HCV core antigen ELISA is not a valid test in diagnosing HCV infection in G-CSF-treated PBPC donors. Moreover, false-positive results of this test on blood donors might be indicative of elevated white blood cell numbers. The low specificity of this assay in the PBPC mobilization setting suggests that molecular assays should be the test of choice in the screening of G-CSF-treated donors."
15774080,Clinical review: Vasopressin and terlipressin in septic shock patients.,2005,"Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is emerging as a potentially major advance in the treatment of septic shock. Terlipressin (tricyl-lysine-vasopressin) is the synthetic, long-acting analogue of vasopressin, and has comparable pharmacodynamic but different pharmacokinetic properties. Vasopressin mediates vasoconstriction via V1 receptor activation on vascular smooth muscle. Septic shock first causes a transient early increase in blood vasopressin concentrations; these concentrations subsequently decrease to very low levels as compared with those observed with other causes of hypotension. Infusions of 0.01-0.04 U/min vasopressin in septic shock patients increase plasma vasopressin concentrations. This increase is associated with reduced need for other vasopressors. Vasopressin has been shown to result in greater blood flow diversion from nonvital to vital organ beds compared with adrenaline (epinephrine). Of concern is a constant decrease in cardiac output and oxygen delivery, the consequences of which in terms of development of multiple organ failure are not yet known. Terlipressin (one or two boluses of 1 mg) has similar effects, but this drug has been used in far fewer patients. Large randomized clinical trials should be conducted to establish the utility of these drugs as therapeutic agents in patients with septic shock."

41473889,Building a transdisciplinary network to improve survival in children with cancer in Colombia: seeds to forests.,2025,"Childhood cancer mortality is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. The World Health Organization Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer aims for a survival of 60% by 2030. This initiative prioritizes timely diagnosis, access to standardized therapy and supportive care, and prompt management of treatment-related complications. Collaborative work is linked to better performance of health systems and delivery of high-quality care. While collaborative strategies between high- and lower-income countries can advance cancer care in low- and middle-income countries, local and regional initiatives are essential to improve clinical outcomes. The high treatment-related mortality in children with cancer in low- and middle-income countries highlights the critical need to collaborate. To decrease treatment-related mortality in children with cancer in Colombia, a new model of transdisciplinary collaboration was built among Colombian scientific societies (pediatrics, pediatric hematology/oncology, infectious diseases, critical care), academic institutions, grassroots foundations, and the Colombian Childhood Cancer Clinical Outcomes Surveillance System: VIGICANCER. The network supports resource and knowledge exchange to tackle public health challenges related to accessing cancer care for children. It enables the design of targeted and tiered multilevel interventions to enhance quality of care for Colombian children and adolescents with cancer. This transdisciplinary network aims to improve survival in Colombian children with cancer and close the gap with high-income countries by establishing data-informed targets and developing a strategic roadmap to address sepsis, the most actionable cause of treatment-related mortality. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the number of years of life lost, thereby supporting societal progress in Latin America."
15601646,Neonatal colonic mucormycosis--a tropical perspective.,2005,"Neonatal gastrointestinal (GI) mucormycosis is a rare, usually fatal, opportunistic fungal infection, which is difficult to diagnose early or preoperatively. We report three babies, only one of whom survived, with a review of the literature. All three had similar findings of necrosis of colon with multiple perforations. While the first baby was diagnosed as long segment Hirschsprung's, the second was treated as small left colon but went on to show signs of peritonitis. The third presented with pneumonia, which progressed to sepsis and peritonitis. All three were diagnosed by histology postoperatively and two of them succumbed, one in spite of amphotericin and the other as he was too sick to start antifungals and had a rapid downhill course. The one who survived did so even though she did not receive amphotericin, but had clear margins of resection. The only chance of survival in this fatal disease is early diagnosis and rapid institution of aggressive therapy inclusive of adequate surgical debridement and appropriate antifungal medications."
20422137,"Clinical presentations, prognostic factors, and mortality in patients with Aeromonas sobria complex bacteremia in a teaching hospital: a 5-year experience.",2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bacteremia due to Aeromonas sobria complex is an uncommon clinical presentation, associated with a high mortality rate. This retrospective study reviewed the clinical manifestations and prognostic factors of A. sobria complex bacteremia. METHODS: From September 2001 to August 2006, all adult patients with A. sobria complex bacteremia treated at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were included. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 33 patients with A. sobria complex bacteremia, 66.7% were men and 72.0% were older than 50 years. Most patients (72.7%) had community-acquired infection. The commonest associated conditions were liver cirrhosis (42.4%) and neoplasm (30.3%). With the exception of diarrhea, the clinical manifestations were similar to those of other Aeromonas spp. Secondary bacteremia occurred in 51.5% of patients, most of whom had either biliary tract infection (47%) or peritonitis (23.5%) as the major infection focus. Monomicrobial bacteremia was recorded in 23 patients. All isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin; 90.9% were susceptible to aztreonam and piperacillin-tazobactam, 87.9% to imipenem, and 78.8% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The mortality rate was 39.4% and nearly 50% of deaths occurred within 96 h of admission. Hypotension, impaired renal function, and liver cirrhosis were significantly associated with a high mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: A. sobria complex bacteremia usually occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis or neoplasm. In patients with A. sobria complex bacteremia, a secondary infection focus should be considered. Adequate antibiotics should be given early, especially to patients with hypotension and impaired renal function."
25510299,Evaluation of endothelial damage in sepsis-related ARDS using circulating endothelial cells.,2015,"PURPOSE: Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction are involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS. Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) may be a useful marker of endothelial dysfunction and damage but have been poorly studied in ARDS. We hypothesized that the CEC count may be elevated in patients with sepsis-related ARDS compared to those with sepsis without ARDS. METHODS: ARDS was defined according to the Berlin consensus definition. The study population included 17 patients with moderate or severe ARDS, 9 with mild ARDS, 13 with sepsis and no ARDS, 13 non-septic patients, and 12 healthy volunteers. Demographic, hemodynamic, and prognostic variables, including PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, 28-day survival, blood lactate, APACHE II, and SOFA score, were recorded. CECs were counted in arterial blood samples using the reference CD146 antibody-based immunomagnetic isolation and UEA1-FITC staining method. Measurements were performed 12-24 h after diagnosis of ARDS and repeated daily for 3 days. RESULTS: The median day-1 CEC count was significantly higher in patients with moderate or severe ARDS than in mild ARDS or septic-control patients [27.2 (18.3-49.4) vs. 17.4 (11-24.5) cells/ml (p < 0.034), and 18.4 (9.1-31) cells/ml (p < 0.035), respectively]. All septic patients (with or without ARDS) had higher day-1 CEC counts than the non-septic patients [19.6 (14.2-30.6) vs. 10.8 (5.7-13.2) cells/ml, p = 0.002]. CONCLUSION: The day-1 CEC count was significantly higher in ARDS patients than in other critically ill patients, and in moderate or severe ARDS patients compared to those with milder disease, making it a potentially useful marker of ARDS severity."
20191193,Two outbreaks of mixed etiology associated with central venous catheters inserted by phlebotomy in critical neonates.,2009,"Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci are the main cause of sepsis in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Central venous catheters (CVCs) are an important part of critical neonates' treatment and are associated with sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate two outbreaks caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis associated with CVC inserted by phlebotomy in critical neonates. The surveillance was performed from January 2001 to December 2005 at the Brazilian NICU. The genotypic analysis of oxacillin susceptible S. aureus (OSSA) and oxacillin resistant S. epidermidis (ORSE) was performed based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Staphylococcus was the most frequent pathogen (65.8%) with highest incidence of CoNS (59.9%) followed by S. aureus (40.1%). During the five years of surveillance, there were two outbreaks detected, occurred in January-February/02 and August/02 and confirmed by PFGE analysis. The predisposing factors for infection corresponding to both outbreaks were: age < or =7 days, hospitalization > or =7 days, and use of polyethylene CVC through dissection of vein (phlebotomy). This is the first relate of staphylococcal outbreaks associated with CVC inserted by phlebotomy in NICU. PFGE showed polyclonal spread of OSSA during both epidemic and endemic period, and two monoclonal outbreaks of ORSE in the same epidemic period of OSSA."
20045294,Interaction of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin with lipopolysaccharide in vitro and in an experimental mouse model of septic shock caused by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of Escherichia coli.,2010,"s-thanatin, an analogue of thanatin, was synthesised by substituting the fifteenth amino acid threonine with serine and showed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. To evaluate its antimicrobial activity against a multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolate as well as its anti-endotoxin activity, its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding and -neutralising activity in vitro and its therapeutic efficacy in an experimental model of septic shock caused by a MDR clinical isolate of Escherichia coli were studied. The ability of s-thanatin to bind or neutralise LPS from E. coli O111:B4 was determined using a quantitative assay kit. Male ICR mice were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 2x10(10) colony-forming units of E. coli E79466. Following bacterial challenge, all animals were randomised to receive i.p. administration of saline, 40mg/kg ceftazidime (CAZ), or 40mg/kg CAZ+s-thanatin (10, 20 or 40mg/kg). The results showed that s-thanatin not only completely bound to the LPS (median effective concentration of 17.5microg/mL) but also improved the survival and reduced the number of inoculated bacteria in a mouse model of septic shock. s-thanatin may be an attractive candidate to develop as an anti-MDR bacterial agent."
41457045,A new proposed approach to categorize sepsis sub-phenotypes based on combined trajectories of perfusion index and central venous oxygen saturation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Circulatory disturbances in sepsis are heterogeneous but often present clinically as a mismatch between peripheral perfusion and tissue oxygenation. Peripheral perfusion index (PI) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) have been independently validated as prognostic markers in sepsis; however, their combined utility has not been systematically explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2021. A novel index, PISO = (PI - 1.1) x ScvO(2), was calculated every 6 hours during the first 72 hours following sepsis onset. Dynamic time warping and hierarchical agglomerative clustering were applied to the 72-hour PISO trajectories to identify sub-phenotypes, with internal validation and sensitivity analysis. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the sub-phenotypes based on early clinical features. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, with particular focus on the association between 12-hour cumulative fluid balance and 28-day in-hospital survival. RESULTS: Among 12,975 patients, 5,205 (40.1%) developed sepsis. Of these, 720 patients with complete 6-hourly PI and ScvO(2) data were included. Three distinct PISO sub-phenotypes were identified. Phenotype 3, (n = 190, 33.0%), characterized by a persistently declining trajectory from a negative baseline, was associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. The random forest classifier demonstrated best performance and identified key early clinical features that differentiated each sub-phenotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a 12-hour cumulative fluid balance of </=0 mL was significantly associated with improved 28-day survival in Phenotype 1 (p = 0.038) and Phenotype 2 (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A persistently negative and declining PISO index within the first 72 hours of sepsis onset identifies a potential-risk sub-phenotype associated with adverse outcomes. Additionally, a non-positive 12-hour cumulative fluid balance post-sepsis onset is associated with improved survival in select phenotypic subgroups."
19953020,[Lung abscess due to community acquired Klebsiella pneumonia].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: In western countries, community-acquired pneumonias due to Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) are rare and associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality. The severity is in part linked to the virulence of Kp. Immuno-depression, sepsis and visceral abscesses are frequently found, constituting other classical risk factors for severity and contributing to the poor prognosis. The therapeutic strategy is based on third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and quinolones. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a young adult, with undiagnosed diabetes, hospitalized as an emergency for septic shock complicating a community-acquired pneumonia due to Kp and associated with multiple brain and lung abscesses. After several weeks of treatment, initially with empirical then specific antibiotics, a favourable outcome was obtained. CONCLUSION: This case report underlines the particular severity of infections due to Kp and their main pathophysiological mechanisms. It is also an opportunity to highlight the potential responsibility of Kp in the presence of a pneumonia with lung abscesses and finally to update the principles of antibiotic therapy."
15717510,[The specific features of lipid metabolism and changes in the plasma activity of transaminases in patients with sepsis].,2004,"A parallel study of changes in the activity of transaminases and the parameters of lipid metabolism was conducted in patients with sepsis or septic shock, receiving renal replacement therapy. The multiple baseline increase in the activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was observed in about 50% of the patients and the elevated level of triglycerides and very low density-lipoprotein cholesterol in all the examinees. In case of the baseline multiple increased activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase as compared with the normal physiological values, the probability of a good clinical outcome was some 67%, in the survivors, the activity of the enzyme significantly increasing during therapy. In the absence of the baseline multiple increased activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, there was a good clinical outcome provided that there were positive changes in triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol during therapy and its probability was about 33%. It is concluded that the activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and the concentration of triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be used to evaluate the efficiency of treatment and as predictors of the outcome of treatment in patients with sepsis and septic shock."
25674208,"Dexamethasone attenuates LPS-induced changes in expression of urea transporter and aquaporin proteins, ameliorating brain endotoxemia in mice.",2014,"AIM: AQP4 in the brain is involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of encephalopathy. AQPs family changes in kidney were accompanied by altered UTs family. The aim of this study was to observe AQP4 and UT-A3 expression in CNS and to explore their role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia encephalopathy following peripheral LPS injection in mice. METHODS: Endotoxemia was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. The expression of UT-A3 and AQP4 in brain were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, the level of cytokines were detected by ELISA, and the content of LDH, AST/ALT, BUN and CREA were detected by colorimetric method. RESULTS: As compared with the control group, in model group, the brain weight/ body weight ratio increased by 13%. Meanwhile, a 2.5 fold increase in LDH and a 1.2 fold increase in AST/ALT were found in peripheral serum (P < 0.05), and also, BUN and CREA increased 2.5 fold (P < 0.01). In addition to severe CNS injury in response to lipopolysaccharide, the contents of cytokines and the expression of AQP4 protein in hippocampal is increased (P < 0.05), while the expression of UT-A3 protein in the hippocampus and cortical astrocytes decreased (P < 0.05). And, in part, Dexa pretreatment attenuated those effects. CONCLUSIONS: In endotoxemia encephalopathy, AQPs and UTs which regulate the functions of cell membrane are both altered. We suggested that the molecular mechanisms of regulation in endotoxemia may provide a new strategy for clinical treatment of the disease and drug binding sites."
15637990,[Results of intensive therapy of meningococcal sepsis in children].,2001,"The authors report on the method, course and results of treatment of patients with meningococcal septicaemia. The two most common forms of meningococcal disease are meningococcal septicaemia (MS) and meningitis. Severe MS is a fulminant form of sepsis characterized by a rapidly spreading purpuric rash, haemodynamic instability and rapid progression to shock or death. The diganosis of MS was confirmed by isolation of NM in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and/or positive solubile bacterial antigenes. However, in some children whose symptoms were consistent in MS (temperature and extensive purpura), no bacterial or soluble antigens were detected, particularly when they had been previours antibiotic treatment. Several scoring systems have been used to predict morbidity and mortility from MS. We selected the prognostic scor developed by Malley et al. Absolute neutrophil count less than 3 x 10(3)/mm3, platelet count less than 150 x 10(3)/mm3 and poor perfusion are indicators of poor prognosis. The presence of at least two of these indicators was associated with an 82% of risk of death. We reviewed the hospital records of 36 paediatric patients with acute meningococcal infection during a 5-year period. The age of our patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean 4.4 yrs). Twenty seven (70%) of 36 children had MS and 11 (40.7%) had both MS and meningitis. Based on Malley scor, 13 (48.1%) patients had at least two predictors with > 82% of risk of lethal outcome. Four children (30.7%) died. Severe MS was diagnosed in 16 (59.2%) patients, who required mechanical ventilation (16; 59.2%), or continuous inotropic support and invasive measures of circulatory parametars (15; 55.5%). Shock treatment consisted of large volumes of crystalloid or colloid infusions thad ranged from 140 to 500 ml/kg/24 hrs (mean 215 ml/kg) Our results indicate that early controlled mechanical ventilations increase safety of large volume infusion with continuous invasive monitoring and inotropic stimulation, and may contribute to a greater survival of children with severe MS."
41430158,EBV-Tonsillitis with superinfection involving Staphylococcus aureus and Prevotella Oris leading to life-threatening bleeding in a 13-year-old girl: a case report.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections of the upper airways are common in children and adolescents, often presenting with mild symptoms and typically resolving without the need for hospitalization. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gammaherpesvirus, can cause diverse clinical syndromes and transient immune dysregulation, potentially predisposing to bacterial superinfection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 13-year-old girl with critical upper airway obstruction due to necrotizing ulcerative oropharyngitis in the context of an EBV infection, with superinfection by Prevotella oris and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from operative tissue specimens. Within a very short time, the patient developed EBV-associated nephritis and pneumonia, severe sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extensive soft-tissue necrosis precipitated life-threatening hemorrhage from the right external carotid artery followed by a second hemorrhage on the left, requiring coil embolization and ligation. Additionally, the patient experienced neurological complications due to thiamine deficiency, contributing to a complex and prolonged recovery process. Despite the severity of her illness, multidisciplinary management enabled stabilization and eventually discharge to a rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, fulminant necrotizing oropharyngitis with bilateral external carotid hemorrhage during acute EBV infection in an immunocompetent adolescent is exceedingly rare. This highlights the importance of considering anaerobic oral colonizers as potential pathogens in maxillofacial infections. Clinicians should reassess for bacterial superinfection when EBV courses are protracted or deteriorating."
20016149,Endothelial bioreactor ameliorates endotoxemia sepsis in swine.,2010,"INTRODUCTION: Severe sepsis involves a complex response including the activation of lots of cells, inflammatory mediators, and the hemostatic system. Central to this process is an alteration of endothelial cell function. Therefore, we investigated whether an endothelial bioreactor (EBR) would provide a new therapeutic approach to this clinical disorder. METHODS: EBR was constructed using a cartridge which contained with nonwoven polytetrafluoroethylene seeded with porcine iliac artery endothelial cell (PIEC). Pigs were intravenously administered with 0.25 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide and immediately placed in an extracorporeal circuit with EBR or sham controls. RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, EBR therapy resulted in significantly higher mean arterial blood pressure and significantly lower plasma von Willebrand factor, endothelin-1 and scores of lung injury. These alterations were associated with a significant survival advantage in the EBR group. CONCLUSIONS: Timely intervention with EC therapy in a tissue-engineered bioreactor may improve cardiovascular performance and alter the natural history of endotoxemia sepsis."
15719614,Molecular detection of Babesia equi in infected and carrier horses by polymerase chain reaction.,2003,"Twenty-three blood samples were used in this study; five were from five naturally infected horses with Babesia equi (B. equi), while eighteen were from asymptomatic horses with equine babesiasis from different localities in Egypt. All samples were subjected to microscopic examination, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The carrier animals were microscopically detected in 7 out of 18 samples (38.8%) and in 9 of 18 by using IFA (50%), whereas PCR revealed that 14 samples were positive (78%). Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, based on the B. equi merozoite antigen gene (EMA-1) were used. A 819 bps DNA fragment is specifically amplified from the gene encoding EMA-1 of B. equi. Our results demonstrate that PCR is a valuable technique for routine detection of B. equi in chronically infected horses, even at low parasitaemia levels."
32825857,"Demographic profile, clinical and microbiological predictors of mortality amongst admitted pediatric TB patients in a tertiary referral tuberculosis hospital.",2020,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) constitutes 8% of the total caseload of TB. Children are particularly vulnerable to dissemination of disease and mortality. AIM: To determine mortality rate, elucidate type of TB, causes and predictors of mortality, if any, in admitted pediatric TB patients. METHODS: Present retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center over last 6(1/2) year on children who died out of total TB admissions. RESULTS: Out of total 1380 pediatric (<15 years of age) TB admissions, 74 children died, a mortality rate of 5.36%. Mean age was 11.4 years with highest mortality 47 (63.51%) in patients from 11 to 14 years age group. Significant majority 58 (78.38%) patients were females (p < 0.011). Range of hospital stay was 0-113 days with 7 (9.5%), 9 (12.16%) and 27 (36.48%) children dying on day of admission, next day and 3rd-7th day respectively, therefore a total of 43 (58.11%) died within first week of admission. Most 60 (81.08%) patients belonged to poor socio-economic status. History of contact was present in 12 (16.22%) cases while none had diabetes. 31 (41.89%) patients had sepsis and severe anemia (Hb </= 6 g %) was present in 6 (8.11%) patients at admission, out of which 4 died on the same day of admission, even before blood could be arranged. Most patients 68 (91.89%) had pulmonary TB with 25 children having concomitant extrapulmonary involvement, while 4 (5.41%) had meningeal TB and 2 (2.70%) had disseminated TB with HIV. Microbiological confirmation was achieved in 51 (68.92%) (48 PTB and 3 EPTB) cases while 23 (31.08%) were clinically diagnosed. Bilateral extensive fibro-cavitary disease with infiltrations was the commonest. Drug resistance was confirmed in 21 (28.38%) with 2, 5, 8, 5 and 1 patient diagnosed with mono H, RR, MDR, pre-XDR and XDR respectively but results of 9 patients were received posthumously. Treatment given was category 1, category 2 and regimens for drug resistant TB in 24 (32.43%), 29 (39.19%) and 21 (28.37%) cases respectively based on prior history of ATT and drug sensitivity. Adverse drug reactions were noted in 12 (16.21%) cases. Noted immediate causes of mortality were cardio-respiratory failure, sudden pneumothorax, massive hemoptysis, sepsis, extensive pulmonary disease and aspiration pneumonia. The pointers towards mortality include female gender, severe malnutrition, anemia, extensive disseminated disease and drug resistant TB. Ignorance, dependency of children on parents, poor adherence and late referrals into the system lead to delayed diagnosis and initiation of proper regimen based treatment. CONCLUSION: Early referrals of non-responders and failures to centers equipped with programmatic management facilities are essential for proper, timely management of pediatric TB to reduce mortality."
41504355,Intraoperative Anaphylaxis in the Setting of Undiagnosed Alpha-Gal Syndrome: A Heart Team Clinical Conundrum.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a delayed allergic reaction to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, a carbohydrate in nonprimate mammalian tissue. Reactions can occur in individuals exposed to lone star ticks after consuming red meat and dairy products and/or exposure to mammal-derived medications or bioprosthetic materials. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old man undergoing valve and ascending aortic replacement experienced hemodynamic collapse after transfusion of heparin, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. Transfusion reaction, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis were ruled out. Recovery occurred within 6 hours of medical treatment. After an otherwise uncomplicated hospitalization, he was diagnosed with AGS and treated with diet restriction and omalizumab. DISCUSSION AND TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: In addition to anaphylaxis, AGS may also have long-term cardiovascular effects such as early bioprosthetic valve failure, accelerated atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. Understanding of clinical subtleties of AGS and its cardiovascular implications is important for clinicians who manage these patients both in the short and long terms."
31854218,Combination of 16S rRNA and procalcitonin in diagnosis of neonatal clinically suspected sepsis.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of 16S rRNA in diagnosing patients with neonatal sepsis. METHODS: We studied 60 consecutive neonatal patients with clinically suspected sepsis and 20 non-infective cases as controls. All patients were diagnosed with sepsis by clinical and experimental criteria. Clinical characteristics were recorded and 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted for all patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the detection methods were analyzed. RESULTS: The detection limit of 16S rRNA sequencing was 1 x 10(2) CFU/mL. For suspected sepsis, the positive rate of 16S rRNA detection was 93.3%, which was similar to that of procalcitonin detection (85%), and was significantly higher than that of bacterial culture (51.7%). The specificity of procalcitonin detection (74.1%) was significantly lower than that of 16S rRNA detection (100%). Moreover, the combination of 16S rRNA and procalcitonin detection showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74.1%, and accuracy of 92.0%. For proven sepsis, the sensitivity and specificity of 16S rRNA detection were both 100.0%, and those for procalcitonin were 87.1% and 87.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Detection of 16S rRNA has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing sepsis. The combination of 16S rRNA and procalcitonin has even better sensitivity with acceptable specificity."

25790622,Efficacy of nafamostat mesilate as anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass for early surgery in patients with active infective endocarditis complicated by stroke.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Recent brain complications (e.g., bleeding or infarction) in patients with active infective endocarditis (AIE) are recognized as a contraindication for early surgery. Nafamostat mesilate (NM) is a synthetic protease-inhibiting agent that has not only potent inhibitory activity against coagulation factors (Xlla, Xa) but also an anti-inflammatory action. Herein is reported the authors' successful surgical experience using NM with low-dose heparinization in patients with AIE complicated by recent cerebral complications. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 54.9 +/- 18.7 years) who had undergone surgery for AIE of the native valve (n = 21) or prosthetic valve (n = 7) were reviewed retrospectively. AIE was present in the aortic (n = 8), mitral (n = 16), aortic/mitral (n = 4) and tricuspid (n = 1) valves. Twenty-two of 28 patients had preoperative stroke, and six had active brain bleeding. Surgery was performed at a mean of 2.4 +/- 2.1 days after the onset of stroke. NM (209 +/- 152 mg) with low-dose heparin (3796 +/- 1218 IU; 67.4 +/- 20.3 IU/kg) was used for anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The activated clotting time (ACT) was maintained at 350-450 s by the precise administration of NM into a cardiotomy reservoir (0.5 mg/kg/h) and a venous reservoir (sliding controlled dose at 1.5 mg/kg/h). RESULTS: The CPB time was 181.3 +/- 92.6 min. Five patients (17.8%) died during hospitalization due to persistent sepsis (n = 3), brain death caused by massive brain embolism before CPB establishment (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). There was no further aggravation of intracranial bleeding, and no new hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSION: Nafamostat mesilate, administered in conjunction with low-dose heparinization, served as an effective anticoagulant for early surgery in patients with AIE complicated by stroke, and caused no further deterioration of the cerebral lesions."
25658559,Detection of Wolbachia genes in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,2015,"Wolbachia 16S rRNA and fbpA genes were twice detected over 5 days in the blood of a patient with high fever. The patient was given fluoroquinolones and the fever resolved. Four weeks later, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and received R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisolone) treatment resulting in complete remission. This is the first report of detection of Wolbachia genes from the blood of human patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
31898559,[Expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of septic shock with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine].,2019,"Septic shock is a pathological stage during the progress of sepsis. The mortality rate is high, and timely, standardized and comprehensive treatment is of great significance in reducing the mortality rate. At present, there are many domestic and international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock. On this basis, China Association of Integrative Medicine Emergency Medicine Committee organized experts to collect evidence-based medical evidence and expert experience in the diagnosis and treatment by integrated Chinese and Western medicine, and referred to the Expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of sepsis with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine published by China Association of Integrative Medicine Emergency Medicine Committee in 2013, developed Expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of septic shock with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The consensus provided a ""China approach"" for the resolution of this worldwide problem. In the ""China approach"", the staging of septic shock is ""longitude"", and the ""four syndromes and four methods"" treatment thought is ""latitude"". Under the framework of interlaced latitude and longitude, we recommend a series of effective integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The method embodies the wisdom of China and has certain guiding significance for the clinical treatment of septic shock."
25883428,Clinical significance of ischemia modified albumin in critically ill patients with sepsis.,2015,"The study was conducted on 38 patients admitted into the intensive care unit with a provisional diagnosis of sepsis and 25 apparently healthy volunteers as controls. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) was assayed by an electrochemiluminescence method. Serum ischemia modified albumin (IMA), expressed as absorbance units was assayed by the albumin cobalt binding test. Patients with sepsis had significantly higher IMA levels (1.087 +/- 0.786) as compared with those without sepsis (0.085 +/- 0.234) with a p value <0.0001. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot showed a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 86.2 %. The area under the curve of the ROC plot was 0.917 with a p value of <0.0001. The higher levels of IMA serve to highlight the occurrence of ischemic damage which could be a prelude to poorer prognosis. The performance characteristics of IMA warrants its inclusion along with PCT as a parameter in the diagnosis of sepsis."
41668763,Mechanistic and therapeutic dimensions of DcR3-mediated immunomodulation in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host-immune responses, progressing through hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive stages. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a soluble member of the TNF receptor superfamily, serves as an immunomodulator in sepsis. Beyond neutralizing FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A to block apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, DcR3 regulates macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and immune cell survival through its heparan sulfate proteoglycan-binding domain. Evidence from cellular, molecular, and animal studies highlights its dual role in restoring immune balance by modulating both hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases of sepsis. In this review, we summarize current evidence on DcR3 in sepsis and discuss translational challenges and future directions. Current rodent models lacking the TNFRSF6B gene are limited; however, transgenic mice expressing human DcR3 exhibit both protective and detrimental context-dependent effects. Translational challenges include the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of recombinant DcR3, although strategies such as PEGylation, nanoparticle encapsulation, and hydrogel delivery may improve its efficacy. Combining DcR3 with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or immunometabolic agents like metformin and dimethyl itaconate presents promising therapeutic potential. Future research will focus on CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in mouse models, multi-omics mapping of DcR3 signaling, and biomarker-guided dosing. Although no DcR3-targeted clinical trials in sepsis have been conducted, DcR3 remains a precision-targeted immunotherapy with mechanistic and translational pathways; this review delineates key knowledge gaps that must be addressed to enable future clinical application."
25834485,"Mean platelet volume in brucellosis: correlation between brucella standard serum agglutination test results, platelet count, and C-reactive protein.",2014,"BACKGROUND: Brucellosis, a zoonotic infection, was most widely diagnosed by the Brucella standard serum agglutination test (SAT). No previous publication has demonstrated a correlation between the degree of Brucella SAT agglutination positivity and the severity of brucellosis infection. OBJECTIVE: To contribute to the clarification of the relationship between patelets and brucellosis. It is also aimed at evaluating the usefulness of the SAT titer as a measure of brucellosis severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We compared the control (n=60) and patients (n=96) groups in terms of mean platelet volume (MPV), C-reactive protein (CRP) and platelet values. Patients were grouped according to their degree of agglutination positivity titers and compared by means of CRP, MPV and platelet values. We also investigated the relationship among logarithmic values of MPV, platelet and CRP parameters for each group. RESULTS: Although statistically meaningful difference was observed between control and patients group in terms of MPV and platelet value, there were no statistically significant differences observed among patients groups. The physiological negative correlation between MPV and platelet count was not encountered in group 2 and 3. Logarithmic values of CRP were not correlated with logarithmic values of MPV and platelet counts. CONCLUSION: The MPV could be a new parameter to evaluate hematologic abnormalities in patients with brucellosis. The SAT titer was not a useful measure for evaluation of the severity of brucellosis."
31811882,Progress and challenges of a pioneering hepatitis C elimination program in the country of Georgia.,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Georgia, with a high prevalence of HCV infection, launched the world's first national hepatitis C elimination program in April 2015. A key strategy is the identification, treatment, and cure of the estimated 150,000 HCV-infected people living in the country. We report on progress and key challenges from Georgia's experience. METHODS: We constructed a care cascade by analyzing linked data from the national hepatitis C screening registry and treatment databases during 2015-2018. We assessed the impact of reflex hepatitis C core antigen (HCVcAg) testing on rates of viremia testing and treatment initiation (i.e. linkage to care). RESULTS: As of December 31, 2018, 1,101,530 adults (39.6% of the adult population) were screened for HCV antibody, of whom 98,430 (8.9%) tested positive. Of the individuals who tested positive, 78,484 (79.7%) received viremia testing, of whom 66,916 (85.3%) tested positive for active HCV infection. A total of 52,576 people with active HCV infection initiated treatment and 48,879 completed their course of treatment. Of the 35,035 who were tested for cure (i.e., sustained virologic response [SVR]), 34,513 (98.5%) achieved SVR. Reflex HCVcAg testing, implemented in March 2018, increased rates of monthly viremia testing by 97.5% among those who screened positive for anti-HCV, however, rates of treatment initiation decreased by 60.7% among diagnosed viremic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of people living with HCV in Georgia have been detected and linked to care and treatment, however, identification and linkage to care of the remaining individuals with HCV infection is challenging. Novel interventions, such as reflex testing with HCVcAg, can improve rates of viremia testing, but may result in unintended consequences, such as decreased rates of treatment initiation. Linked data systems allow for regular review of the care cascade, allowing for identification of deficiencies and development of corrective actions. LAY SUMMARY: This report describes progress in Georgia's hepatitis C elimination program and highlights efforts to promote hepatitis C virus screening and treatment initiation on a national scale. Georgia has made progress towards eliminating hepatitis C, treating over 50,000 people, approximately one-third of the number infected, and achieving cure for 98.5% of those tested. However, identifying infected individuals and linking them to care remains challenging. Novel approaches to increase diagnostic testing can have unintended consequences further down the care cascade."
19949757,Clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality in patients with Enterobacter aerogenes bacteremia.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enterobacter aerogenes is increasingly encountered in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics and to identify the predictors of mortality in patients with E. aerogenes bacteremia. METHODS: From March 2001 to April 2007, all patients with positive blood cultures for E. aerogenes at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The medical records were reviewed for clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: Eighty eight patients were included, 9 (10.2%) of whom died of E. aerogenes bacteremia. Most of the patients had comorbidities. Seventy nine patients (89.8%) had nosocomial infections, and 43 patients (48.9%) had polymicrobial infections. Eighty four patients (95.5%) presented with fever. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was administered for 80 patients (90.9%), but was appropriate for only 55 patients (62.5%). Of the 9 patients who died, 8 had polymicrobial infection, 5 of whom had nosocomial pneumonia, and 6 did not receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Multivariate analysis indicated that high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (>16) [odds ratio (OR), 16.569; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-221.24; p = 0.034] and strains not susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (OR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.02-83.04; p = 0.048) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of E. aerogenes bacteremia, reflected by high APACHE II score and isolation of strains with no susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, were independent risk factors for mortality. Patients with severe illness and isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins should be treated with more potent antimicrobial agents."
15690970,Procalcitonin in patients with acute and chronic renal insufficiency.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections are associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate in patients with acute and chronic renal failure. Because C-reactive-protein (CRP) is elevated in many patients with renal failure, even in the absence of infection, procalcitonin (PCT) might be useful for the detection of systemic bacterial infections. This cross-sectional observation study measured PCT and CRP in several groups of patients with various types, degrees and treatments of kidney diseases, including patients with sepsis treated with renal replacement therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined PCT and CRP in 85 renal patients with different stages and treatments of renal insufficiency: chronic renal failure (CRF) n=23, patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) n=20, patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy (HD) n=42 and in a group of 40 patients with septic conditions, including 20 patients with acute renal failure (ARF). The infectious status of the patients was monitored. RESULTS: PCT in serum (reference value in healthy controls < 1 microg/l) was within the normal range in patients with CRF and in patients on both short-term HD (< 1 year) and long-term HD (> 1 year) (median of 0.25 microg/l and 0.61 microg/l). However, PCT was elevated in patients on CAPD (median of 1.18 microg/l). In patients with sepsis, PCT was massively elevated in both the presence and absence of ARF. In contrast, CRP (reference value < 5 mg/l) was markedly increased in patients undergoing short- and long-term HD (medians of 14.5 and 51.1 mg/l) but not in patients on CAPD. In patients with CRF and systemic bacterial infections, both PCT and CRP were markedly elevated (median PCT 63 microg/l, CRP 130 mg/l) but, in contrast to PCT, CRP values overlapped in infected and non-infected patients. There was no relevant decrease in plasma concentrations of PCT by hemofiltration or hemodialysis in patients with sepsis. CONCLUSION: With the exception of CAPD patients, PCT levels were not significantly affected by renal diseases or treatments but were markedly elevated in the presence of infections. Thus PCT is a valuable marker for early diagnosis of systemic bacterial infections in patients with CRF or patients undergoing HD. In contrast, CRP is elevated in several groups with renal diseases and has low specificity for the diagnosis of bacterial infections."
20301297,IPEX Syndrome.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome is characterized by systemic autoimmunity, typically beginning in the first year of life, which includes the triad of enteropathy (manifesting as malabsorption and watery diarrhea), endocrinopathy (most commonly type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), and eczematous dermatitis. In addition to these manifestations, many children have other autoimmune phenomena including cytopenias, autoimmune hepatitis, nephropathy, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, alopecia, arthritis, and interstitial lung disease related to immune dysregulation. Fetal presentation of IPEX syndrome includes hydrops, echogenic bowel, skin desquamation, intrauterine growth deficiency, and fetal akinesia. Without aggressive immunosuppression or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the majority of affected males will die within the first one to two years of life from metabolic derangements, severe malabsorption, or sepsis. Individuals with a milder phenotype have survived into the second or third decade of life, but this is uncommon. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is established in a male proband with typical clinical findings, absent regulatory T cells (Treg) in blood or tissues, decreased numbers of FOXP3-expressing T cells in peripheral blood determined by flow cytometry (although FOXP3 levels in Treg can be normal in some individuals), and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in FOXP3 identified by molecular genetic testing. Heterozygous females have not been reported to have clinical findings typical of IPEX syndrome. MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapies: HSCT offers the only potential cure for IPEX syndrome. T cell-directed immune suppression can include either an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) or calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin A or tacrolimus), alone or in combination with corticosteroids. Supportive care: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with fluids and electrolyte support is needed until intestinal function can be established with immune suppression. Treatment of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with insulin and carbohydrate management is standard, as is management of autoimmune thyroid disease. Skin conditions are managed with topical therapies, which can include steroids, tacrolimus, and emollients. Autoimmune neutropenia has been successfully treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; pemphigus nodularis has been treated with rituximab (anti-CD20), and rituximab has been used for other autoantibody-mediated disease. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be required for autoimmune neutropenia or recurrent infections with central venous access and TPN. Aggressive management of dermatitis with topical steroids and anti-inflammatory agents as needed to prevent cutaneous infections. Surveillance: Monitor growth, nutritional intake, and stooling patterns at each visit; glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c, and thyroid function tests every three to six months; skin exam at each visit; complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, and serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase every three to six months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Withhold immunizations until after HSCT, if possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk males either prenatally or immediately after birth to enable early diagnosis and HSCT and/or immune suppression treatment in affected males before significant organ damage occurs. GENETIC COUNSELING: IPEX syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has a FOXP3 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous (to date, IPEX syndrome has not been reported in females who are heterozygous for a FOXP3 pathogenic variant). Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the FOXP3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, identification of female heterozygotes and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."
32241039,[Risk factors associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis].,2019,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in neonates. OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for neonatal sepsis in a neonatal unit from March to October, 2016. METHODS: Case-control study. The factors analyzed were: a) neonatal factors such as: type of delivery, sex, birth weight, gestational age, criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, type of sepsis (early or late) and blood culture result; B) invasive methods such as: central catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, umbilical catheterization and mechanical ventilation; C) maternal factors such as: number of prenatal controls, infection during pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes, maternal age and maternal fever. Odds Ratio was used to determine association. RESULTS: For the development of early-onset sepsis, significant risk factors were: thermodynamic imbalance, tachycardia and maternal fever. With regard to late-onset sepsis, significant associations were found for thermodynamic imbalance, umbilical catheterization, mechanical ventilation and insufficient prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Thermodynamic imbalance, tachycardia, mechanical ventilation, umbilical catheterization, maternal fever, and insufficient prenatal care were the probable risk factors associated with neonatal sepsis."
41433302,Lycopene inhibits ER stress and apoptosis while modulating PI3K/AKT and enhancing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic proteins.,2025,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical clinical syndrome with limited therapeutic options. This study investigated the renoprotective effects of lycopene, a potent antioxidant, in both in vivo and in vitro AKI models. In a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis-AKI model, pretreatment with lycopene (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated renal histopathological damage (HE staining) and restored serum biomarkers (AST, ALT, BUN, CREA). Mechanistically, lycopene suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/Akt axis: it significantly reversed the CLP-induced upregulating of p-PI3K and p-Akt, and the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3), while increasing Nrf 2 and SOD1. Consistent results were observed in LPS- and H(2)O(2)-induced cellular AKI models, where lycopene attenuated cell death and restored redox homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence assays further validated these trends. Crucially, PI3K siRNA or cDNA transfection experiments confirmed that lycopene's antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects were PI3K-dependent. Our findings highlight lycopene as a promising therapeutic agent for AKI, acting via PI3K/Akt-mediated activation of Nrf 2 to counteract oxidative damage and apoptosis. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lycopene's renoprotection and supports its potential clinical translation for sepsis or oxidative stress-associated AKI."
25523077,Endocarditis by Kocuria rosea in an immunocompetent child.,2015,"Kocuria rosea belongs to genus Kocuria (Micrococcaceae family, suborder Micrococcineae, order Actinomycetales) that includes about 11 species of bacteria. Usually, Kocuria sp are commensal organisms that colonize oropharynx, skin and mucous membrane; Kocuria sp infections have been described in the last decade commonly affecting immunocompromised patients, using intravenous catheter or peritoneal dialysis. These patients had mainly bacteremia/recurrent sepsis. We hereby describe the case of a 10-year-old girl, immunocompetent, who had endocarditis/sepsis by K. rosea which was identified in five different blood cultures by Vitek 2 ID-GPC card (BioMerieux, France). Negative HIV serology, blood count within normal range of leukocytes/neutrophils and lymphocytes, normal fractions of the complement, normal level of immunoglobulins for the age; lymphocyte immunophenotyping was also within the expected values. Thymus image was normal at chest MRI. No catheters were required. Identification of K. rosea was essential to this case, allowing the differentiation of coagulase-negative staphylococci and use of an effective antibiotic treatment. Careful laboratory analysis of Gram-positive blood-born infections may reveal more cases of Kocuria sp infections in immunocompetent patients, which may collaborate for a better understanding, prevention and early treatment of these infections in pediatrics."
32148915,Copeptin levels in patients with coronary artery ectasia.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The etiology and pathophysiology of coronary artery ectasia (CAE) has not been fully elucidated. A rapid rise in plasma copeptin has been observed in cardiovascular diseases, stroke, sepsis, and shock. This increase has diagnostic and prognostic value. The aim of this study was to investigate whether copeptin has a relationship with CAE. METHODS: This observational prospective study was carried out between October 2012 and March 2013 in the cardiology catheter laboratory with the inclusion of 44 subjects with a diagnosis of CAE and 44 age- and gender-matched individuals with normal coronary arteries. Blood samples obtained from the patients were stored at -70  degrees C until analysis and copeptin levels in sera were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: This study comprised 88 study participants, among whom 44 were patients meeting ectasia criteria [mean age: 58.0 +/- 11.5 years; 59% (n = 26) male], and 44 were control subjects with angiographically normal coronary anatomy [mean age: 49.2 +/- 10.1 years; 30% (n = 13) male]. Copeptin levels were similar between the groups (p > 0.05). In addition, there was no correlation between copeptin levels and CAE. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is examined that copeptin levels were not elevated in CAE patients."
25520446,Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Eggerthella lenta bacteremia.,2015,"Eggerthella lenta is an emerging pathogen that has been underrecognized due to historical difficulties with phenotypic identification. Until now, its pathogenicity, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, and optimal treatment have been poorly characterized. In this article, we report the largest cohort of patients with E. lenta bacteremia to date and describe in detail their clinical features, microbiologic characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. We identified 33 patients; the median age was 68 years, and there was no gender predominance. Twenty-seven patients (82%) had serious intra-abdominal pathology, often requiring a medical procedure. Of those who received antibiotics (28/33, 85%), the median duration of treatment was 21.5 days. Mortality from all causes was 6% at 7 days, 12% at 30 days, and 33% at 1 year. Of 26 isolates available for further testing, all were identified as E. lenta by both commercially available matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) systems, and none were found to harbor a vanA or vanB gene. Of 23 isolates which underwent susceptibility testing, all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, and meropenem, 91% were susceptible to clindamycin, 74% were susceptible to moxifloxacin, and 39% were susceptible to penicillin."
15595387,OmpA of a septicemic Escherichia coli O78--secretion and convergent evolution.,2004,"OmpA is an important constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. OmpA is involved in a variety of host-bacteria interactions, including crossing of the blood-brain barrier by E. coli strains causing newborn meningitis, and elicits a significant response by the immune system of the host. The bactericidal effect of neutrophil elastase (NE) is also attributed to degradation of the bacterial OmpA. Here we examined the OmpA of septicemic E. coli 078 strains and show that two surface-exposed loops are conserved among invasive strains of E. coli and other pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, there is evidence for convergent evolution, implying the existence of selective pressure. Our results also indicate that large quantities of OmpA are secreted into the medium during all phases of growth, where it is present both in secreted vesicles and as a soluble secreted protein. We assume that secreted OmpA can play a role in protection of bacteria from NE by competitive inhibition. Support for this assumption was obtained from experiments indicating that addition of exogenous, purified OmpA reduces killing of bacteria by NE."
41479436,A Twist in the Tale: The Unmasking of Listeria in a PMR Case.,2026,"In general, an older patient presenting with proximal muscle pain and fatigue, with elevated inflammatory markers, would generally result in an extensive evaluation. If this is negative, it would be reasonable for a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) to be made and the patient referred to rheumatology. Our patient presented myalgia in proximal muscles and an elevated sedimentation rate. He was treated with steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica with improvement. He was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where a diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes sepsis was made and treated. With antibiotics he improved and was discharged from the hospital. This Case Report underscores the importance of considering unusual infections when entertaining a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) as the cause of systemic inflammatory response syndrome."
31885832,Machine Learning Models for Analysis of Vital Signs Dynamics: A Case for Sepsis Onset Prediction.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: Achieving accurate prediction of sepsis detection moment based on bedside monitor data in the intensive care unit (ICU). A good clinical outcome is more probable when onset is suspected and treated on time, thus early insight of sepsis onset may save lives and reduce costs. METHODOLOGY: We present a novel approach for feature extraction, which focuses on the hypothesis that unstable patients are more prone to develop sepsis during ICU stay. These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient's likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. RESULTS: Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient's probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours. The best area under the curve (AUC) was achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function, which was 88.38%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of predictive accuracy along with the simplicity and availability of input variables present great potential if applied in ICUs. Variability of a patient's vital signs proves to be a good indicator of one's chance to become septic during ICU stay."
16197848,[Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal toxic shock].,2004,"In the last years has been observed an increased incidence of invasive group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, including the toxic shock syndrome. The most common portal of entry is the skin and mucous membranes. The toxic shock syndrome can occurred as a rare complication of pharyngitis. The association between varicella and the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs with necrotizing fasciitis by Streptococcus pyogenes has been discussed without reach at consensus, but some authors disapproved the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in this viral infection. The authors reported the clinical case of a 12 year old adolescent, that 15 days after the diagnosis of mononucleosis infectious confirmed by serology and treated with ibuprofen, was internment by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome with rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis, cellulitis of the leg, arthritis of the knee and pleural effusion. Therapeutics was made with penicillin G and clindamycin. We present this case for the severity of the clinical situation and for the questions that rise."
15745290,Bentall procedure using cryopreserved valved aortic homografts: mid- to long-term results.,2004,"The Bentall procedure is the standard operation for patients who have lesions of the ascending aorta associated with aortic valve disease. In many cases, however, mechanical prosthetic conduits are not suitable. There are few reports in the English-language medical literature concerning the mid- to long-term outcome of Bentall operations with cryopreserved homografts. Therefore, we reviewed our experience with this procedure and valved homografts. From January 1997 through December 2002, 21 patients underwent a Bentall operation with cryopreserved homografts at our institution. There were 14 males and 7 females; the mean age was 36 +/- 21 years (range, 15-74 years). Eleven patients had undergone previous aortic valve surgery. All patients had aortic dilatation or aneurysms involving the ascending aorta. Indications for surgery included aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency, and aortic valve endocarditis (native valve or prosthetic). One patient had Takayasu's arteritis and 3 had Marfan syndrome. There was 1 hospital death (due to sepsis), but no other major postoperative complications. The mean hospital stay was 14 +/- 7 days. Follow-up echocardiographic and computed tomographic scans were performed yearly. The mean follow-up was 34 months (6-72 months). Follow-up imaging revealed no calcifications or degenerative processes related to the homograft. Four patients had minimal valve regurgitation. Two patients died during follow-up. The 3-year actuarial survival rate was 85.7%. Our data suggest that the Bentall procedure with a valved homograft conduit is a safe procedure with excellent mid- to long-term results, comparable to results reported with aortic valve replacement with a homograft."
41402459,Outcomes of septic shock from urinary and non-urinary sources in nonagenarians and centenarians admitted to intensive care units.,2025,"Although sepsis-related mortality has declined with advances in care, the incidence of septic shock is rising by 1-8% annually. As life expectancy increases, the >/= 90-year-old population is projected to reach 10 million in the U.S. by 2050, highlighting septic shock as a growing public health burden. Despite urinary tract infections being a common cause, non-urinary sources may carry higher mortality. However, outcome data in nonagenarians and centenarians are limited. This study compares outcomes by infection source in ICU patients aged 90 years or older with septic shock. This retrospective study, approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee (No. 253/24), used de-identified data from the ANZICS Adult Patient Database (2010-2023), including nonagenarian and centenarian ICU patients with septic shock. Variables included demographics, comorbidities, frailty, severity scores, and 24-h biomarkers. Outcomes were mortality by infection source and length of stay. Propensity score matching ensured covariate balance. Time-dependent Cox models and AUROC analysis were used. Complete case analysis was performed, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Among 1095 ICU patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher short-term mortality compared to urinary sources, even after propensity matching (300-day HR 1.348; p = 0.012). ICU mortality (15.7% vs. 8.6%) and hospital mortality (29.0% vs. 17.3%) were also higher in the non-urinary group. APACHE III score, but not age or SOFA score, predicted mortality. Urine output and arterial pH were the best mortality discriminators for non-urinary and urinary sources, respectively. Higher SOFA and APACHE III scores were linked to shorter hospital stays, but not ICU length of stay. In critically ill patients aged >/= 90 with septic shock, infection source was an independent, time-dependent predictor of mortality. Non-urinary tract infections were associated with significantly higher mortality than urinary tract infections for the first 300 days, despite comparable illness severity. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of infection source and its role in early risk stratification, triage, and end-of-life planning. Simple physiological markers, including urine output and arterial pH, demonstrated additional discriminatory value. As the very elderly ICU population grows, integrating infection source and early physiological indicators into tailored prognostic tools is essential to guide individualized, efficient care in high-resource critical care settings."
41431771,"Rare Case of Campylobacter jejuni Bacteremia in a Pediatric Patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Clinical Management, Pathophysiology, and Public Health Implications.",2025,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide; however, systemic infections such as bacteremia remain rare, particularly in immunocompetent individuals. This case report presents a rare instance of C. jejuni bacteremia in a 12-year-old girl undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), emphasizing the increased vulnerability of immunocompromised pediatric patients. The patient was admitted with febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. Blood cultures taken at admission signaled positive after 90 hours, and the isolate was identified as C. jejuni using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed sensitivity to erythromycin, which led to successful treatment and recovery following a 10-day antibiotic course. The case illustrates the pathophysiological role of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and mucosal barrier damage in facilitating bacterial translocation and systemic infection. It also highlights diagnostic challenges due to the fastidious nature and slow growth of the organism, reinforcing the importance of rapid diagnostic tools and targeted therapy based on susceptibility results. In an era of rising antimicrobial resistance and growing populations of immunocompromised patients, this report underscores the critical need for heightened clinical awareness, robust laboratory support, and preventive public health strategies to mitigate the risk of severe Campylobacter infections in vulnerable groups."
41418639,RETN stratification identifies a highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes in early stage of polytrauma.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Despite early survival, many polytrauma patients ultimately succumb to sepsis driven by trauma-induced immunosuppression. The emergence of HLA-DR(low) monocytes was recognized as a biomarker of immunosuppression, yet they are heterogeneous, and reduced HLA-DR expression does not consistently correlate with global monocyte impairment. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the heterogeneity of HLA-DR(low) monocytes and clarify their specific contributions to immunosuppression. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) were applied to delineate the temporal differentiation trajectories of monocyte subsets post-trauma, leading to the identification of a distinct RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes and characterization of its immunosuppressive functions. Finally, we established a clinical cohort and used published datasets to explore its predictive capacity for sepsis in polytrauma patients. RESULTS: ScRNA-seq and FCA revealed quantitative and functional reprogramming across monocyte subsets and identified a conserved RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) subset enriched in polytrauma patients, characterized by reduced HLA-DR and elevated RETN expression. This subset exhibited profound impairments in core monocyte functions-including antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and cytokine production-compared to other monocyte subsets. Notably, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes can predict sepsis more accurately than HLA-DR(low) monocytes at 72 h (AUC: 0.89 vs. 0.74) post-trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a distinct functional monocyte subset, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes, with markedly impaired hallmark monocyte functions. RETN expression can identify this highly immunosuppressive subset of HLA-DR(low) monocytes. In polytrauma patients, RETN(high)HLA-DR(low) monocytes provided more accurate prediction of sepsis than total HLA-DR(low) monocytes."
25548783,Flow cytometric enumeration of parasitemia in cultures of Plasmodium falciparum stained with SYBR Green I and CD235A.,2014,"A flow cytometric (FACS) detection method for Plasmodium falciparum cultures (P. falciparum) was developed using SYBR Green I and CD235A and compared against the Giemsa stained microscopic examination. The cultured P. falciparum were spiked into red blood cells (RBCs) to yield parasitemia, ranging from 0.01% to 22.0%. FACS analysis demonstrated a clear separation between P. falciparum infected and uninfected RBCs. The measured percentage of parasitemia by FACS revealed higher precision (CV of 2.2-37.2%) with the sensitivity of 0.01% parasitemia than Giemsa stained microscopic examination (CV of 7.2-66.0%). High correlation of measured parasitaemia (r=0.98, P<0.05) was observed between FACS and Giemsa stained microscopic analyses. The higher levels of parasitaemia detection were observed in all ranges by FACS in comparison to Giemsa stained microscopic analysis. The currently reported FACS method using SYBR Green I and CD235A is potentially useful for measuring parasitemia in treating patients."
19951476,[Diagnostic value of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in myocardial injury of neonatal septicemia].,2009,"OBJECTIVE: Neonatal sepsis can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, especially including myocardial injury and heart failure. In this study, the authors observed the changes and the levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in myocardial injury of neonatal sepsis at the different stages to search for the early diagnostic index of myocardial injury and heart failure in patients with neonatal septicemia. METHOD: The levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were determined in 96 newborns with neonatal septicemia according to the diagnosis and treatment program of neonatal septicemia in 2003. The 96 cases were divided into myocardial injury group and non-myocardial injury group. Every newborn was tested for the levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the second day, fifth day and tenth day of septicemia and in the different gestational age infants. Meanwhile, the results were compared to creatine kinase isoenzyme and troponin I. RESULT: The levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were significantly different between myocardial injury group and non-myocardial injury group at the fifth day (P<0.05), especially the levels of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were significantly elevated at the early stage (on the second day) between the two groups (P<0.05). On the fifth day, the values of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were (315.5 +/- 69.7) pmol/L in myocardial injury group, but the value of non-myocardial injury group was (179.3 +/- 27.5) pmol/L. On the fifth day, the results of plasma brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I were significantly different and had statistical significance between the myocardial injury group and non-myocardial injury group (P<0.05), while the results of creatine kinase isoenzyme had no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The values of plasma brain natriuretic peptide were respectively (215.5 +/- 69.6) pmol/L and (119.3 +/- 37.4) pmol/L, While N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were (315.5 +/- 69.7) pmol/L and (179.3 +/- 27.5) pmol/L in the two groups. The value of troponin I was (1.57 +/- 0.39) microg/L in the myocardial injury group and that in the non-myocardial injury group was (0.55 +/- 0.2) microg/L. The values of creatine kinase isoenzyme were (33.3 +/- 10.1) u/L in the myocardial injury group, but that of non-myocardial injury group was (17.4 +/- 8.5) u/L. In the different gestational age infants, the values of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide of premature infants were the highest in the three groups. The values of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were (159.5 +/- 39.6) pmol/L and (238.5 +/- 49.7) pmol/L in premature infants. CONCLUSION: The levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide evidently increased in myocardial injury of neonatal sepsis, especially in premature infants. The increase of plasma brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may be helpful in early diagnosis of the myocardial injury of neonatal sepsis associated with cTnI. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may become a useful index to diagnose the myocardial injury and should be widely used in the neonatal intensive care unit."
25509707,Clinical outcomes of children with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia.,2014,"BACKGROUND: A relentless increase in the rate of carbapenem-resistant among Acinetobacter baumannii has substantially reduced the access to effective antimicrobial regimens. Currently limited information is available regarding the prognosis or outcomes of children with blood stream infection caused by carbapenem resistant A. baumanii. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical outcomes and predictors for fatality among children with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) bloodstream infection (BSI). MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted among children hospitalized at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health (Children's Hospital), Bangkok, Thailand. Those who had CRAB isolated from blood cultures during theperiod between October 2005 and September 2010 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 89 cases of BSI caused by CRAB were identified. The incidence was 1.2 cases per 1,000 hospitalized patients. The median age at onset of bacteremia was 62 days and 88% had at least one underlying comorbidity. The 2-week and 30-day case fatality rates were 39% and 42%, respectively. A large proportion of deaths (63%) occurred before blood culture results became available. Extended spectrum resistance, defined as resistance to all other first line antibiotics at the hospital, i.e., all cephalosporins, aminoglycoside, quinolone and carbapenems, was significantly associated with a higher 2-week case fatality rate (CFR) (48% compared with 23% among their counterpart, p = 0.028) and death at an earlier stage of the bacteremia (Kaplan-Meierp = 0.016). In univariate analysis, factors associated with 2-week case fatality include malignancy-associated febrile neutropenia, fever >/=2 days before the initiation of appropriate antibiotic, presence of septic shock, organ dysfunction, and being infected by extended spectrum resistant strains. Correspondingly, CFR of cases who received >/=1 appropriate empiric antibiotics within 24 hours of clinical suspicion appears to be lower albeit not reaching statistical significance, than their counterpart, i.e., the CFRs between the two groups were 10% vs. 23%, respectively (p = 0.675). Colistin susceptibility based on disc diffusion test remained high (100%) in this sample. Nevertheless, those who received colistin treatment had a 2-week CFR of 20%. On the other hand, none of the cases infected with sulbactam susceptible strain, who received sulbactam containing regimen (n = 15), died. No significant renal toxicity was observed among children receiving colistin treatment in our sample. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistant A. baumannii bacteremia exhibited a high fatality rate, which mainly occurred before the pathogen was known to the clinicians. Extended spectrum resistance was associated with high fatality rate. Early administration of effective empirical antibiotics such as colistin and sulbactam in this sample was associated with lower fatality rate among children affected by this condition."
31881849,Septic pulmonary embolism in China: clinical features and analysis of prognostic factors for mortality in 98 cases.,2019,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical features of septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) cases and prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality in China. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of SPE patients hospitalized between January 2007 and June 2018 in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with SPE were identified. All patients had bilateral multiple peripheral nodules on chest computed tomography. The most common pathogen found in blood culture was Staphylococcus aureus (10/33, 30.3%). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 39 patients and 20 showed vegetations. Bronchoscopy was performed in 24 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 15 patients (62.5%) and showed predominantly polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (52%, range of 48%~ 63%). Four patients received transbronchial lung biopsy, and histopathological examinations revealed suppurative pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.4%. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.100; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.169), hypotension (OR 7.260; 95% CI 1.126-46.804) and ineffective or delay of empirical antimicrobial therapy (OR 7.341; 95% CI 1.145-47.045) were found to be independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality, whereas drainage treatment was found to be a protective factor (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.002-0.677). CONCLUSIONS: SPE cases presented with nonspecific clinical manifestations and radiologic features. Blood cultures and bronchoscopy are important measures for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis. There is relationship between primary infection sites and the type of pathogen. Maintaining normal blood pressure and providing timely and appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for effective control of the infection could improve prognosis."
25672873,The early antibiotic therapy in septic patients--milestone or sticking point?,2014,"Sepsis is one of the oldest and most elusive syndromes in medicine. Every effort should be made to treat these patients with the best available evidence. As a milestone, empiric antimicrobial therapy is essential in order to reduce morbidity and mortality of septic patients. As a sticking point, the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be associated with induction of resistance among common pathogens."
15631849,[Monitoring serum levels of gentamicin in neonates].,2003,"Newborn infants in intensive care units demonstrated a higher incidence of gestational age below 31 week. Obstetrical and neonatal diseases procedures required for the management of critically ill neonates are associated with an increased risk of infections. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic often used to treat gram-negative bacillary infections and suspected sepsis in neonates. The risk of toxicity or poor efficacy is further increased due to the recognised wide intra and interpatient variability of the newborn. The present work involved 49 infants of 31.3 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- SD) weeks of gestational age, weighing 1.7 +/- 0.8 kg and were treated with standard doses of gentamicin (3.8 +/- 0.9 mg/kg/day). Routine clinical care data were retrospectively collected from the medical records in the neonatal intensive-care unit at Coimbra University Hospital. Data analysis demonstrated that potentially toxic serum levels were observed in 49% of newborn infants (trough > 2 mg/L). Additionally, the obtained results also showed that 7.5% of peak concentrations were found to be higher than 10 mg/L. Potentially sub-therapeutic concentrations were observed in 15% of the patients (peak > 6 mg/L)."
41449806,Risk and prognosis of colorectal cancer following bacteraemia with Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus complex: A Swedish nationwide retrospective cohort study.,2025,"There is a positive association between bacteraemia with Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the relationship between the timing of SBSEC bacteraemia and CRC is not well-established. Associations with other gastrointestinal cancers have also been suggested. Using national registries, we retrospectively examined the incidence of CRC and other gastrointestinal cancers after SBSEC-bacteraemia in Sweden 2010-2019, and analysed the timing, characteristics, and prognosis of diagnosed CRC. Individuals with SBSEC-bacteraemia were matched to randomly selected controls from the general population at a 1:10 ratio. Cox-regression determined CRC hazard ratios (HR). In total, 908 individuals with SBSEC-bacteraemia were identified and 9,080 controls, of whom 75/908 (8.3%) and 168/9080 (1.9%) respectively had previously diagnosed CRC (p < 0.01). During follow-up of individuals without previous CRC, CRC was diagnosed in 45/833 (5.4%) individuals with SBSEC and 114/8912 (1.3%) controls (p < 0.01). The HR of CRC diagnosis for SBSEC was 10.3 (95% CI 6.7-15.8) overall and 19.8 (95% CI 11.1-35.3) during the first year of follow-up. In conclusion, there was an increased incidence of CRC, and most were diagnosed within the first year. Neither the tumour location, -stage, or -grade of diagnosed CRC nor the rates of other gastrointestinal cancers differed significantly."
15640650,Increased percentage of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells during septic shock is due to the decrease of CD4+CD25- lymphocytes.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: The elevation of the percentage of regulatory CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes (Treg) has been recently described during septic shock. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether this increased percentage was due to Treg proliferation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Adult intensive care units in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Patients with septic shock (n = 54) and healthy individuals (n = 30). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients, we first confirmed the increased percentage of Treg among CD4+ lymphocytes in comparison with healthy individuals. Surprisingly, regarding absolute counting, we demonstrated that both T CD4+ lineages (CD25+ and CD25-) were diminished immediately after the onset of shock. Then, whereas Treg returned rapidly to healthy donors values, CD4+CD25- T lymphocytes remained dramatically reduced. Finally, Foxp3 (Treg-related gene) messenger RNA quantification enabled us to definitively rule out a lack of proliferation since it was not increased during shock. CONCLUSION: The increased percentage of Treg after shock is due not to their proliferation but to a decrease in CD4+CD25- T lymphocyte number. We hypothesize that it might be due to a resistance of Treg to apoptosis processes occurring during septic shock."
20099765,Occult pneumonia: an unusual but perilous entity presenting with severe malnutrition and dehydrating diarrhoea.,2009,"A three-month old boy was admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the problems of acute watery diarrhoea with some dehydration and suspected dyseletrolytaemia, severe malnutrition, and reduced activity. Occult pneumonia was added to the problem list after demonstration of radiologic consolidation in right upper lung, despite the lack of clinical signs, both on admission and after correction of dehydration. The problem list was further expanded to include bacteraemia due to Staphylococcus aureus when the blood culture report was available. Severely-malnourished children may not exhibit typical clinical signs of pneumonia, and the possibility of existence of such problems should be remembered in the assessment and provision of care to hospitalized young children with severe malnutrition."
15592996,Effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype on HCV and HIV-1 disease.,2005,"The relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 disease is not well defined. The present study analyzed data from a cohort of 207 HIV-1-infected and 126 HIV-1-uninfected children and adolescents with hemophilia who enrolled in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study and were followed for 7 years. The mean HCV RNA level was higher in the participants in the HCV genotype 1 group than in the participants the HCV non-genotype 1 group, among both the HIV-1-infected (difference, +0.33 log(10) copies/mL; P=.038) and HIV-1-uninfected (difference, +0.59 log(10) copies/mL; P=.008) participants. Although HCV genotype was not associated with differences in HIV-1 RNA level, a significantly lower mean CD4(+) T cell count (difference, -127 cells/ microL; P=.026) and percentage of CD4(+) T cells (difference, -4.3%; P=.027) were observed in the participants in the HCV genotype 1 group, compared with those in the participants in the HCV non-genotype 1 group. In addition, the participants in the HCV genotype 1 group were at increased risk for progression to AIDS-related mortality (hazard ratio, 2.44; P=.037). The present study suggests that HCV infection and genotype may influence the natural history of HCV and HIV-1 disease."
31855709,C-reactive protein as a prognostic factor in intensive care admissions for sepsis: A Swedish multicenter study.,2020,"PURPOSE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is not included in the major intensive care unit (ICU) prognostic tools such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS). We assessed CRP on ICU admission as a SAPS-3 independent risk marker for short-term mortality and length of stay (LOS) in ICU patients with sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult ICU admissions satisfying the Sepsis-3 criteria to four southern Swedish hospitals were retrospectively identified and divided into a low CRP group (<100 mg/L) and a high CRP group (>100 mg/L) based on the admission CRP level. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 851 admissions were included. The SMR was higher in the high CRP group (0.85 vs. 0.67, P = .001 in the whole sepsis group and 0.85 vs. 0.59, P = .003 in the culture-positive subgroup). The CRP levels also correlated with ICU and hospital LOS in survivors (P < .001 and P = .002), again independent of SAPS-3. CONCLUSION: An admission CRP level >100 mg/L is associated with an increased risk of ICU and 30-day mortality as well as prolonged LOS in survivors, irrespective of morbidity measured with SAPS-3. Thus, CRP may be a simple, early marker for prognosis in ICU admissions for sepsis."
25611273,Identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.,2014,"Chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. It is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. A number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. The isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Proteus mirabilis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), group G beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). In comparison to the other isolates, P. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by S. aureus, with insignificant differences between MRSA and non-methicillin resistant isolates. The Enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. The isolation of MRSA, ESBL-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. This study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. However, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed."

25541918,The fate of suboptimal anastomosis after colon resection: An experimental study.,2014,"BACKGROUND: The fate of suboptimal anastomosis is unknown and early detection of anastomotic leakage after colon resection is crucial for the proper management of patients. METHODS: Twenty-six rats were assigned to ""Control"", ""Leakage"" and ""Suboptimal anastomosis"" groups where they underwent either sham laparotomy, cecal ligation, and puncture or anastomosis with four sutures following colon resection, respectively. At the fifth hour and on the third and ninth days; peripheral blood and peritoneal washing samples through relaparotomy were obtained. The abdomen was inspected macroscopically for anastomotic healing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 16s rRNA and E.coli-specific primers were run on all samples along with aerobic and anaerobic cultures. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of PCR on different bodily fluids with 16s rRNA and E.coli-specific primers were 100% and 78%, respectively. All samples of peritoneal washing fluids on the third and ninth days showed presence of bacteria in both PCR and culture. The inspection of the abdomen revealed signs of anastomotic leakage in eight rats (80%), whereas mortality related with anastomosis was detected in two (20%). CONCLUSION: Anastomotic leakage with suboptimal anastomosis after colon resection is high and the early detection is possible by running PCR on peritoneal samples as early as 72 hours."
19961873,Vancomycin MIC creep in MRSA isolates from 1997 to 2008 in a healthcare region in Hong Kong.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether vancomycin MIC creeps among blood methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from 5 hospitals in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2008. METHODS: Blood cultures MRSA isolates from 1997 to 1999 (period 1), 2004 (period 2) and 2006-2008 (period 3) were retrieved. Etest method was used to determine their vancomycin MIC. The genotypic features were determined by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: 247 blood MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MIC were 0.375, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for 15 (6.1%), 68 (27.5%), 89 (36%) and 75 (30.4%) isolates, respectively. There was an increase in the percentage of isolates with an MIC=1mg/L from 10.4% (5/48) during period 1 to 21.6% (8/37) during period 2 and 38.3% (62/162) during period 3 (period 1 vs. period 3, P<0.001). Molecular typing showed that this was due to increased percentages of clonal cluster (CC) 8/SCCmec III/IIIA (agr group I), CC45/SCCmec IV/V (agr group IV) and other minor clones with elevated MIC over time. CONCLUSION: This study found vancomycin MIC creep among blood MRSA isolates over time. As elevated MIC within the susceptible range may reduce vancomycin efficacy, clinical laboratories should adopt methods with the required precision to accurately determine MICs."
25299040,Barth Syndrome.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Barth syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized in affected males by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and prepubertal growth delay; however, not all features may be present in an affected male. Cardiomyopathy, which is almost always present before age five years, is typically dilated cardiomyopathy with or without endocardial fibroelastosis or left ventricular noncompaction; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also occur. Heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; risk of arrhythmia and sudden death is increased. Neutropenia is most often associated with bacterial infections and aphthous ulcers, pneumonia, and sepsis. Skeletal myopathy predominantly affects the proximal muscles, and results in delays in development of early motor skills. Prepubertal growth delay is followed by a postpubertal growth spurt with remarkable ""catch-up"" growth. Heterozygous females who have a normal karyotype are asymptomatic and have normal biochemical studies. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Barth syndrome is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and either an increased monolysocardiolipin-to-cardiolipin ratio (if available) or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in TAFAZZIN (formerly TAZ) identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of Barth syndrome is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Elamipretide is indicated for the improvement of muscle strength in individuals with Barth syndrome. Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of cardiac issues include: (1) for cardiac arrhythmia, consideration of antiarrhythmic medications or implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD); (2) for heart failure, careful fluid and volume management and avoidance of overdiuresis and dehydration, standard heart failure medications, and cardiac transplantation when heart failure is severe and intractable. Interventions for other findings include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for neutropenia; physical therapy for skeletal muscle weakness; standard treatment for talipes equinovarus and/or scoliosis; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement for persistent feeding issues; uncooked cornstarch prior to bedtime for hypoglycemia; standard management of developmental delay / intellectual disability. Prevention of secondary complications: Aspirin therapy to prevent clot formation in those with severe cardiac dysfunction and/or marked left ventricular noncompaction; antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent infections; limit fasting or provide intravenous glucose infusion prior to planned medical procedures; regularly monitor blood potassium concentrations during administration of IV fluids that contain potassium and during episodes of diarrhea; consult with nutritionist and/or gastroenterologist to determine optimal caloric delivery. Surveillance: Monitoring existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations requires at least annual electrocardiography with Holter monitor and echocardiography; as-needed electrophysiologic studies to assess for potentially serious cardiac arrhythmia; at least semiannual complete blood count with differential as well as with all febrile episodes; at each visit, measurement of height and weight, clinical assessment of strength, and clinical assessment for scoliosis; every three to five years during childhood, formal assessments of developmental progress and educational needs. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting, use of rectal thermometers in those with neutropenia, and use of succinylcholine. Although growth hormone is typically not indicated as most affected males will attain normal stature by adulthood, recommendations about use of human growth hormone may vary based on endocrinology testing and recommendations. The muscular involvement in Barth syndrome may increase the risk for malignant hyperthermia compared to the general population. Evaluations of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing (if the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant in the family is known) or monolysocardiolipin-to-cardiolipin ratio testing (if the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant in the family is not known) of male sibs of a proband and male relatives in the maternal lineage is appropriate to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. GENETIC COUNSELING: Barth syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes. Heterozygous females typically do not manifest the disease. Affected males transmit the TAFAZZIN pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons.

She was started on nifedipine for tocolysis and to facilitate administration of steroids. Two and a half hours later, the patient developed tachycardia and hypotension. Sepsis from chorioamnionitis, acute cardiac event and pulmonary embolism were considered as differential diagnoses. Laboratory and radiological investigations, however, ruled out these possible causes of haemodynamic instability. Her clinical condition deteriorated and hypotension remained intractable despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. An emergency caesarean section at 24 weeks of gestation was carried out in the interest of saving the mother's life. The haemodynamic status of the patient recovered rapidly postcaesarean section. This case report highlights the rare but potentially serious adverse effects of hypotension in administration of nifedipine; and thus reminds us of the importance of judicious prescription and careful titration of nifedipine as a tocolytic."
31855152,D-dimer corrected for thrombin and plasmin generation is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with sepsis.,2020,"BACKGROUND: D-dimer (DD) is the most used fibrin-related marker and has been proposed, either alone or in combination with other variables, as prognostic factor in patients with sepsis. However, DD generation depends on both coagulation and fibrinolysis, meaning that it may give false negative results in conditions associated with marked fibrinolytic inhibition such as sepsis. In this study, we tested whether correction of DD for thrombin and plasmin generation could improve its prognostic significance in septic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a nested study in 269 septic patients from the ALBIOS trial. DD, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP) were assayed at day 1. Corrected DD (DD(corr)) was calculated by the formula DDxPAP/F1+2, such that the lower the DD(corr) the greater the imbalance in favour of fibrin formation over fibrin lysis, and vice-versa. Primary outcome was 90-day mortality. RESULTS: DD(corr) showed a J-shaped relationship with mortality, which was highest in the first DD(corr) tertile (low fibrinolysis), intermediate in the 3(rd) (high fibrinolysis), and lowest in the 2(nd) (balanced fibrinolysis), suggesting an increased risk whenever the coagulation-fibrinolysis balance is tilted (p<0.0001). Neither DD, nor PAP or F1+2 showed a comparable association with mortality. DD(corr) was an independent prognostic factor in multivariable Cox models and significantly improved risk stratification (cNRI>/=0.28). Finally, by combining DD(corr) and SOFA tertiles, we developed a score with high discriminatory power. DISCUSSION: DD(corr) is a good marker of the in vivo coagulation-fibrinolysis balance and displays a prognostic value in sepsis much higher than DD."

The most frequent late complications after gastric bypass are ulcer, internal hernia and stenosis. Two cases of stenosis of the bileopancreatic limb with gastric blow-out are described. Urgent diagnosis with computed tomography and acute surgical treatment is vital as the complication can lead to gastric necrosis, pancreatitis, biliary stasis, sepsis and multi-organ failure within a very short time. Prompt contact to specialized surgeons is advocated."
33087012,Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis with gangrene: an autopsy case.,2020,"We describe an autopsy case of a 75-year-old female with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) and gangrene due to macrovascular involvement. She was diagnosed with lcSSc complicated with pulmonary arterial hypertension and digital ulcers 9 years before admission. She had recurrent and refractory lower limb ulcers (LLUs), and died because of sepsis caused by gangrene infection. Autopsy findings revealed severely thickened arterial walls of the visceral organs, consistent with vascular involvement of SSc. Systemic vascular involvement in lcSSc may progress in patients with LLUs who harbour several risk factors for vascular involvement."
41432366,Association of serum calcium levels within the first hour of ER admission with 28-day mortality in sepsis: A retrospective ICU analysis.,2025,"Sepsis poses a global health challenge, necessitating effective predictors for risk stratification and timely intervention. Serum calcium, involved in vital physiological processes, has shown potential associations with sepsis outcomes, but the evidence remains limited and conflicting. This retrospective study included 1000 sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Serum calcium levels were measured within 1 hour of emergency room (ER) admission. Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and severity scores, were collected. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to assess the association between serum calcium levels and 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed the effect of serum calcium on 28-day survival. Lower serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission were significantly associated with higher 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.1097, 95% CI: 0.04024-0.2912, P < .0001), even after adjusting for confounders. The area under the curve for serum calcium in predicting 28-day mortality was 0.5885 (P < .0001). Combining serum calcium with other predictors, such as the Charlson comorbidity index, red cell distribution width, lactic acid levels, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, improved predictive accuracy (area under the curve: 0.7245, P < .0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant association between lower serum calcium levels and reduced 28-day survival (P < .0001). Low serum calcium levels within 1 hour of ER admission are significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. It complements existing predictors, showcasing its potential role in a comprehensive prognostic framework."
31899133,Necessity to identify candida species accurately with minimum inhibitory concentration determination in each case of bloodstream infections.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C. krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were; Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C. auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C. lusitaniae and C. auris strains have >/=1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION: Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections."
31890839,Outcome of children with systemic rheumatic diseases admitted to pediatric intensive care unit: An experience of a tertiary hospital.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To report the outcome of children with rheumatic diseases admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Database from PICU and pediatric rheumatology section used to retrieve all candidate patients admitted to PICU from June 2000 to December 2017. Medical records of all enrolled patients reviewed for diagnosis, organ involvement, reason of PICU admission, the length of stay, and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (17 female, 8 male) with total of 41 admissions identified. The median PICU stay was 13.5 days (range, 3-24). The most frequent diagnoses were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (48%), followed by systemic vasculitis (16%). Most admissions were from the medical ward (68.3%), while 24.4% from the emergency room. The main reason of PICU admission was a disease flare or related complications (48.8%), followed by infection (34.2%). Fifty one percent of the admissions were due to respiratory dysfunction, 46% required non-invasive respiratory support while 38% was in need for mechanical ventilation. During PICU stay, anti-microbial agents used 90.3%, immunosuppressive treatment adjustment 75.6%, anti-hypertensive 24.4% and vasopressors 12.2%. Twelve patients (48%) fully recovered and 40% partially recovered while three patients died during their PICU stay. The causes of death were macrophage activation syndrome complicated by sepsis in two patients and advanced pulmonary hypertension in one patient. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that children with rheumatic diseases, particularly SLE, are mostly admitted to PICU with serious disease exacerbation or severe infection. To improve the outcome, early diagnosis of critical condition and proper intervention are fundamental in reducing mortality."
25500361,Predictors of outpatient kidney function recovery among patients who initiate hemodialysis in the hospital.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Recent policy clarifications by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have changed access to outpatient dialysis care at end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities for individuals with acute kidney injury in the United States. Tools to predict ""ESRD"" and ""acute"" status in terms of kidney function recovery among patients who previously initiated dialysis therapy in the hospital could help inform patient management decisions. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident hemodialysis patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System who initiated in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT) and continued outpatient dialysis following hospital dismissal (2006 through 2009). PREDICTOR: Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), acute tubular necrosis from sepsis or surgery, heart failure, intensive care unit, and dialysis access. OUTCOMES: Kidney function recovery defined as sufficient kidney function for outpatient hemodialysis therapy discontinuation. RESULTS: Cohort consisted of 281 patients with a mean age of 64 years, 63% men, 45% with heart failure, and baseline eGFR>/=30mL/min/1.73m(2) in 46%. During a median of 8 months, 52 (19%) recovered, most (94%) within 6 months. Higher baseline eGFR (HR per 10-mL/min/1.73m(2) increase eGFR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.39; P<0.001), acute tubular necrosis from sepsis or surgery (HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.83-6.24; P<0.001), and heart failure (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.78, P=0.007) were independent predictors of recovery within 6 months, whereas first RRT in the intensive care unit and catheter dialysis access were not. There was a positive interaction between absence of heart failure and eGFR>/=30mL/min/1.73m(2) for predicting kidney function recovery (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: Sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney function recovery in the outpatient hemodialysis unit following in-hospital RRT initiation is not rare. As expected, higher baseline eGFR is an important determinant of recovery. However, patients with heart failure are less likely to recover even with a higher baseline eGFR. Consideration of these factors at hospital discharge informs decisions on ESRD status designation and long-term hemodialysis care."
15724656,"[Ebstein syndrome--various forms, clinical view and treatment results in children].",2004,"Ebstein's anomaly is an uncommon lesion of the tricuspid valve characterized by downward displacement of the tricuspid valve. The aim of the study was an analysis of the form, clinical outcome and treatment results in patients (pts) diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly. METHODS: 28 pts were analysed. Material has been divided into 3 groups, depending on clinical symptoms. The group A was formed with mild shape of the defect, group B all pts presenting significant clinical symptoms requiring treatment, and group C made of pts having severe symptoms requiring intensive treatment including surgical intervention. RESULTS: Anomaly had been detected in 13 boys and in 15 girls. Group A consisted of 6 children, including one boy diagnosed with defect prenatally. Described patient currently is followed-up in pulmonology outpatient clinic due to asthma. Other children are doing well and require no treatment. Group B was represented by 8 children requiring treatment of: sepsis, arrhythmia due to WPW syndrome and in one case ASD 2. Group C consisted of 14 patients. In 7 pts Ebstein anomaly was part of a complex congenital heart defect. In 5 cases dominating symptoms were severe heart failure with cyanosis and arrhythmia and in two cases sepsis. 10 pts had been treated surgically (7 pts had Blalock-Taussig shunt, 1 pt artificial valve replacement, 1 pt Fontan op. and 1 pt ASD 2 suture) where 8 died. The causes of death were: right ventricle failure and arrhythmia in 4, sepsis in 2, and pulmonary artery hypoplasia and metabolic acidosis also in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Ebstein anomaly includes wide spectrum of anatomical and clinical findings. The most severe forms require surgical intervention, however it can be a high risk procedure."
31822372,"Association of Ang-2, vWF, and EVLWI with risk of mortality in sepsis patients with concomitant ARDS: A retrospective study.",2020,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the potential effects of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) on the risk of mortality in sepsis patients with concomitant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This retrospective study recruited 41 sepsis patients with concomitant ARDS from January 2015 to June 2018. Data of Ang-2 and vWF levels, EVLWI, and sequential organ failure assessment scores were collected at 0, 24, and 48 h after admission to the hospital. RESULTS: The length of intensive care unit stay (P = 0.041) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-2 (APACHE II) score (P = 0.003) were associated with the risk of mortality. Furthermore, increased Ang-2 levels and EVLWI at 24 h and 48 h were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Moreover, the APACHE II score at hospital admission significantly predicted the risk of mortality (area under the curve [AUC], 0.834; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.665-0.983). Finally, the models containing a combination of Ang-2 level and EVLWI at 24 h (AUC, 0.908; 95% CI, 0.774-0.996) and Ang-2 level and EVLWI at 48 h (AUC, 0.981; 95% CI, 0.817-1.000) had high diagnostic values for predicting risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate that Ang-2 levels and EVLWI at 24 h and 48 h after admission are significantly associated with the risk of mortality."
41430129,Risk stratification for CMV reactivation in sepsis patients: development of an interpretable machine learning model.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in critically ill populations is associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model to predict CMV reactivation within 28 days of ICU admission in sepsis patients, providing a risk stratification tool to optimize clinical management. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from intensive care unit (ICU) patients meeting SEPSIS-3 criteria. Key clinical variables, including acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ(APACHE Ⅱscore), CMV IgG titer, CD4(+) lymphocyte count, and corticosteroid use duration, were selected through univariate logistic regression. Seven machine learning models were developed, with the gradient boosting machine (GBM) demonstrating superior performance. Model interpretability was enhanced using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to identify critical predictors and visualize feature contributions. RESULTS: Among 221 patients, 19.0% experienced CMV reactivation. The test set AUC values for GBM, logistic regression (LR), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were recorded as 0.761, 0.684, 0.673, 0.659, 0.65, 0.624, and 0.623, respectively. GBM model achieved the highest AUC in the test set, with robust calibration and net benefit of the GBM model in the test set exceeded that of the other models at threshold probabilities ranging from 10% to 60%. SHAP analysis identified the APACHE II score, corticosteroid use, CMV IgG levels, and CD4 + lymphocyte count as the top four important predictors. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated significant stratification between high- and low-risk groups (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This interpretable machine learning model provides accurate CMV reactivation prediction and clear insights into contributing factors. It has the potential to enhance early risk stratification and guide targeted management strategies for sepsis patients in ICU settings.

15633093,Low-level viremia and proviral DNA impede immune reconstitution in HIV-1-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.,2005,"BACKGROUND: Immunological and virological consequences of low-level viremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) remain to be determined. METHODS: For 24 months, 101 HAART-treated, HIV-1-infected patients with HIV RNA levels </=200 copies/mL were followed prospectively: HIV RNA level and CD4 and CD8 cell counts were investigated every 3 months, and proviral DNA and T cell subsets were investigated every 6 months. RESULTS: During follow-up, 33 patients had HIV RNA levels </=20 copies/mL at all visits (uVL patients), whereas 68 patients had HIV RNA levels >20 copies/mL at >/=1 visit (dVL patients) (median increase, 81 copies/mL [interquartile range, 37-480 copies/mL]). dVL patients had higher concentrations of CD8 cells, activated and memory T cells, and proviral DNA, compared with uVL patients (P<.05). A higher HIV RNA level was independently associated with reduced CD4 gain (P<.001). A higher HIV RNA level also was associated with increases in activated CD8(+)CD38(+) and CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) cells (P<.05), and a higher level of activated CD8(+)CD38(+) cells was independently associated with reduced CD4 gain (P<.05). A higher proviral DNA level was associated with increases in CD4(+)CD45RA(-)CD28(-) effector cells and reductions in naive CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CD62L(+) and CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CD62L(+) cells (P<.05). Higher levels of activated CD4(+)HLA-DR(+) and early differentiated CD4(+)CD45RA(-)CD28(+) cells predicted increased risk of subsequent detectable viremia in patients with undetectable HIV RNA (P<.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that low-level viremia and proviral DNA are intimately associated with the immunological and virological equilibrium in patients receiving HAART."
19945482,Prospective cohort study of acute pyelonephritis in adults: safety of triage towards home based oral antimicrobial treatment.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Home-based treatment of acute pyelonephritis (AP) is generally reserved for young non-pregnant women who lack co-morbidity. This study, focusing on the elderly and patients with co-morbidity, evaluates the Dutch primary care guideline that recommends referral to hospital only in case of suspected deterioration to severe sepsis or failure of antibiotic treatment, irrespective of patient's age, sex or co-morbidity. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study including consecutive non-pregnant adults with AP. Clinical and microbiological outcome measures of non-referred patients from 35 primary health care centres (PHC) were compared to patients referred to two affiliating emergency departments (EDs). RESULTS: Of 395 evaluable patients, 153 were treated by PHCs and 242 referred to EDs. The median age was 63years [IQR 43-77], 34% were male, 58% had co-morbidity; all comparable between the PHC and ED group. Referred ED patients were more likely to have signs of sepsis and to have been pre-treated with antibiotics. Bacteraemia was present in 10% of patients in the PHC group and 27% in the ED group (RR 2.83; 95% CI: 1.64-4.86, p<0.001). Eight (5%) PHC patients were admitted during outpatient treatment but otherwise no major complications occurred. Clinical failure rates at 30days were similar between PHC patients and ED patients; 9% and 10% respectively. Mortality rates of PHC patients versus ED patients were 1% versus 5% at 30days (p=0.058) and 1% versus 7% at 90days (p=0.007). Complicated outcome occurred in 6% of the PHC patients versus 12% in the patients referred to ED (p=0.067). CONCLUSION: In a health care system with a well-organized primary care system and clear guideline, the outcome of adults with acute pyelonephritis, including men, the elderly and patients with co-morbidity, selected for oral antibiotic treatment at home did not lead to major complications."
41614879,"Circulating miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p in Post-Mortem Whole Blood: An Exploratory Study of the Association with Sepsis-Related Death.",2025,"Accurate post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis remains a critical challenge in forensic pathology, as conventional morphological findings often lack specificity. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as stable molecular biomarkers, yet their diagnostic value in cadaveric samples is still unclear. This exploratory study investigated the expression of three candidate miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a-3p) in post-mortem peripheral whole blood to assess their association with sepsis-related death versus non-infective controls. Out of 58 cases, 45 met quality-control criteria (26 sepsis-related deaths and 19 controls). miRNA expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, normalized to miR-320, and analyzed using DeltaCt values. Group differences were evaluated using linear regression models with adjustment for age, sex, and post-mortem interval, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. In adjusted models, miR-125b-5p and miR-27a-3p showed evidence of association with sepsis status, whereas miR-122-5p did not. These results support the feasibility of miRNA quantification in post-mortem samples and motivate validation in larger, independent cohorts and within multimodal post-mortem diagnostic frameworks."
25551975,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in obstetric patients. Report of three cases with literature review.,2014,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a serious clinico-neuroradiological maternal complication in pregnancy. Although it has various etiologies such as hypertensive encephalopathy, renal failure, autoimmune disorders, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and treatment with immunosuppressant or cytotoxic agents, pregnancy and postpartum complicated by hypertensive disorders more frequently lead to this condition. PRES is clinically characterized by headache, confusion, seizures, vomiting, and visual disturbances with radiographic vasogenic edema especially affecting symmetrical parietal and occipital lobes. The underlying pathophysiology is still a matter of debate. Prompt recognition and early intervention greatly improve the prognosis, so that obstetricians should be well aware of this rare entity. Timely imaging is of crucial importance especially in patients with an uncertain diagnosis for determining the appropriate treatment and preventing the possible development of neurologic deficits. In the present report, three cases of PRES are presented with clinical and radiological findings in pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The latest literature in the field is also carefully reviewed."
25931940,Risk factors influencing morbidity and mortality in perforated peptic ulcer disease.,2015,"OBJECTIVE: Peptic ulcer perforation continues to be a major surgical problem. In this study, risk factors that influence morbidity and mortality in perforated peptic ulcer disease were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Files of 148 patients who were included in the study due to peptic ulcer perforation between January 2006 and December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Data regarding age, gender, complaints, time elapsed between onset of symptoms and hospital admission, physical examination findings, co-morbid diseases, laboratory and imaging findings, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: The study group included 129 (87.2%) male and 19 (12.8%) female patients. The mean age was 51.7+/-20 (15-88) years. Forty five patients (30.4%) had at least one co-morbid disease. In the postoperative period, 30 patients (20.3%) had complications. The most common complication was wound infection. Mortality was observed in 27 patients (18.2%). The most common cause of mortality was sepsis. Multivariate analysis revealed age over 60 years, presence of co-morbidities and Mannheim peritonitis index as independent risk factors for morbidity. Age over 60 years, time to admission and Mannheim peritonitis index were detected as independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and proper treatment are important in patients presenting with peptic ulcer perforation."
41614723,Use of Ondansetron for Pediatric Gastroenteritis in the Pediatric Emergency Department: An Evaluation of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry.,2026,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of emergency department (ED) ondansetron with hospitalization with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the PECARN Registry of children with AGE. Within a sample matched on vital signs, demographics, clinical severity, imaging performance, and intravenous fluids provision, we used conditional logistic regression to assess associations between administration of ondansetron and hospitalization. We compared rates of 7-day return visits with significant diagnoses between children who did and who did not receive ondansetron on their initial encounter. RESULTS: We included 543,541 encounters, of which ondansetron was administered in 39.7%. After matching, hospital admission occurred in 11.8% and 17.7% of children who did and did not receive ondansetron, respectively, with standardized mean differences <0.1. Ondansetron was negatively associated with hospitalization (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.60-0.63). Children given ondansetron on their index visit had a higher percentage of 7-day return visits with appendicitis (absolute percentage difference, +0.05%, 95% CI: +0.03%, +0.07%), but a lower percentage of return visits with sepsis or bacteremia (-0.03%, 95% CI: -0.05%, -0.01%) compared with children not given ondansetron on their index visit. CONCLUSIONS: Children receiving ondansetron for AGE in the ED had an  approximately 40% lower odds of hospitalization. While appendicitis was diagnosed more frequently within 7 days among children given ondansetron compared with those not given ondansetron, sepsis or bacteremia were less frequently diagnosed. These findings align with prospective studies demonstrating the beneficial impact of ondansetron use in pediatric AGE."
15689129,"[The functional status of circulating lymphoid and phagocytic cells in patients with tropical malaria, living in the endemic areas of Guinea].",2004,"The paper presents the results of a study of immunological parameters in the indigenous adult population of an endemic area of Guinea in tropical malaria of varying severity and the time course of changes in these parameters in different phases of the disease during delagil treatment. Examination of 101 patients has established that tropical malaria in re-infected patients is not accompanied by severe immunosuppression though there is a clear tendency towards lymphocytic immunodeficiency in patients with higher parasitemia and a severe course of the disease. The greatest manifestations of immunosuppression coincide with the high oxygen metabolism of phagocytes, which confirms their important role in the pathogenesis of immune disorders and common syndrome in malaria."
19943468,Comparison of umbilical cord interlukin-8 in low birth weight infants with premature rupture of membranes and intact membranes.,2009,"Some studies showed increased levels ofproinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha in the blood samples of pregnant women with PROM (Premature rupture of membranes) and their neonates. The aim of this study was to find a relationship between increased level of IL-8 and PROM, a cost benefit method for early diagnosis and reduction of hospitalization period of neonatal sepsis. This case control study was conducted in Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Al-Zahra Hospital at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran from 10th April 2001 to 20th June 2003. We studied 50 LBW (Low birth weight) neonates born from mothers with PROM as the case group and fifty LBW neonates born from mothers without PROM as our control group Neonates born from pregnant women with PROM underwent sepsis workup and blood samples from their umbilical cord were sent for blood culture and IL-8 level measurement. Mean levels of IL-8 in study and control groups were 128.12 and 39.2 pg mL(-1), respectively. We had no positive blood culture and no bacteria could be isolated. Significantly elevated values (p<0.0003) were showed in cases with PROM compared to cases without PROM (medians 67.5 pg mL(-1) vs. 29.5 pg mL(-1), respectively). This study showed a strong relationship between IL-8 elevation and PROM. Increased levels of IL-8 can be used as indicator for early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis."
32775655,Fungal Balls Mimicking Renal Calculi: A Zebra Among Horses.,2019,"Background: Fungal masses (fungal ball or bezoars) rarely present as renal calculus. More so, Trichosporon species are even more uncommon among the noncandidial fungal infections affecting urinary tract. We report two such interesting cases that are not yet reported in the current literature. Case Reports: Our first case is a 48-year-old gentleman with diabetes presented with fever and flank pain. He was found to have bilateral obstructing radiolucent renal calculi with azotemia. Initially managed with bilateral Double-J stenting after one session of hemodialysis, and subsequently bilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was accomplished. Our second patient is a 37-year-old lady presented with bilateral flank pain with no comorbidity or sepsis. On evaluation, she was found to have bilateral radiolucent staghorn calculi and for which bilateral PCNL was performed. In view of high suspicion of fungal infection, extracted soft floppy materials were sent for fungal culture and were treated with antifungal agents after Trichosporon species was detected. Conclusion: Although renal fungal infections are rare, a strong suspicion and timely definitive management of such entities in patients with radiolucent renal calculus can prevent devastating invasive disease."
25697247,[Meconium evacuation to improve feeding tolerance in very low birth weight preterm infants (Emita Protocol)].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: It has been reported that feeding tolerance in preterm infants is associated with an early passage of meconium. Prospective, randomized or historical control studies that stimulate meconium evacuation have reported varied results. This study was intented to evaluate the use of enemas to speed up meconium evacuation, facilitating feeding tolerance. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A controlled multicenter randomized trial that evaluated the use of physiological saline enemas with glycerol (0.8 ml glycerol + 3 ml saline or 1 ml glycerol + 5 ml saline depending on babies weighing less or more than 800 g at birth, respectively) versus simulation. This procedure was performed in the first 96 hours of life in infants with birth weight between 500 and 1,250 g. Maternal (preterm delivery, clinical chorioamnionitis, gestational hypertension, administration of magnesium sulfate and prenatal corticosteroids, fetal Doppler altered, type of delivery, gender, weight and gestational age, assessment of Apgar and need for assisted ventilation and oxygenotherapy) and nutritional history (age when feeding volumes of 100 ml/kg/day and full enteral feeding were reached, age to remove meconium, number of days on parenteral nutrition, weight at 28 days, weekly volumes of breast milk and preterm formula) were described. RESULTS: No significant differences were obtained regarding the age to reach full enteral intake or 100 ml/kg/day were found among the 101 patients in the study. Also, no differences in the following secondary variables are observed: number of episodes of late sepsis with or without positive blood culture, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of saline enemas and glycerin in this study does not alter the enteral feeding tolerance in very low birth weight preterm infants."
25540397,Comparison of the next-generation Xpert MRSA/SA BC assay and the GeneOhm StaphSR assay to routine culture for identification of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in positive-blood-culture broths.,2015,"A bloodstream infection with Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is a serious condition that carries a high mortality rate and is also associated with significant hospital costs. The rapid and accurate identification and differentiation of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA directly from positive blood cultures has demonstrated benefits in both patient outcome and cost-of-care metrics. We compare the next-generation Xpert MRSA/SA BC (Xpert) assay to the GeneOhm StaphSR (GeneOhm) assay for the identification and detection of S. aureus and methicillin resistance in prospectively collected blood culture broths containing Gram-positive cocci. All results were compared to routine bacterial culture as the gold standard. Across 8 collection and test sites, the Xpert assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.6% (range, 96.4% to 100%) and a specificity of 99.5% (range, 98.0% to 100%) for identifying S. aureus, as well as a sensitivity of 98.1% (range, 87.5% to 100%) and a specificity of 99.6% (range, 98.3% to 100%) for identifying MRSA. In comparison, the GeneOhm assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.2% (range, 95.2% to 100%) and a specificity of 96.5% (range, 89.2% to 100%) for identifying S. aureus, as well as a sensitivity of 94.3% (range, 87.5% to 100%) and a specificity of 97.8% (range, 96.1% to 100%) for identifying MRSA. Five of six cultures falsely reported as negative for MRSA by the GeneOhm assay were correctly identified as positive by the Xpert assay, while one culture falsely reported as negative for MRSA by the Xpert assay was correctly reported as positive by the GeneOhm assay."

Symptoms are hoarseness, dysphagia, neck/throat pain, subcutaneous emphysema and fever. Imaging and endoscopic diagnosis can give false negative results. We present a case of a 74-year-old male, who was readmitted with sepsis and abscess in the operation area three weeks after anterior cervical surgery. Veillonella parvula was found in the abscess material and computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of oesophageal perforation."
31865323,"Sequential Extracorporeal Therapy Collaborative Device and Timely Support for Endotoxic, Septic, and Cardiac Shock: A Case Report.",2020,"We report a 49-year-old man, without prior medical history, consulted in the emergency department with a 5 day history of cough, fever, and dysuria. He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to septic shock. Critical care management was initiated, including mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Endotoxic shock was suspected (endotoxin activity assay [EAA] 0.75), and 2 treatments with Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (Toraymyxin(R), Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were performed in 48 h, alternate with high-volume hemofiltration sessions. Initial blood cultures were positive for Neisseria meningitidis (serogroup B), and a lumbar puncture was deferred because of the coagulopathy and a bleeding risk. The circulatory efficiency significantly improved after the second procedure of hemoperfusion, and the treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the serum endotoxin level (EAA <0.4). However, after 48 h, tachycardia did not improve, left ventricular ejection fraction was 20%, and circulatory insufficiency progressed. Therefore, considering the involvement of septic cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated for circulation assistance on day 3 from admission. Continuous cytokine hemoadsorption (Cytosorb(R), Cytosorbent Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) was incorporated into a VA-ECMO circuit for 48 h without a considerable improvement. For this reason, a 72-h continuous veno-venous hemodialysis session was started in which a high cutoff filter was used. Tachycardia and myocardial dysfunction improved by day 6, and VA-ECMO was withdrawn on the tenth day. Subsequently, nutrition management and rehabilitation were performed, and the patient was transferred to the department of respiratory medicine on day 80, he was discharged from our hospital on day 113. Sequential extracorporeal therapy may be beneficial when concomitant with circulatory assistance in uncontrollable cases of septic shock using catecholamines and blockers."

41412306,"Characteristics of invasive group B streptococcal infections in adults and older individuals in a super-aging society in Japan, 2016-2023.",2026,"BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract, can cause invasive GBS (iGBS) infections, particularly in older adults with underlying comorbidities. We determined the relationship between mortality and host-related or virulence factors in older adults with iGBS infections. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 105 cases of iGBS infection treated between January 2016 and October 2023 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and two affiliated hospitals. The association between patient outcomes and demographics, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, medical treatment, biomarkers, antimicrobial agents used at admission, and capsular type of GBS isolates was examined. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 78 years (interquartile range, 64-85 years), and 89.5 % had underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and malignancies. Common clinical manifestations include skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and urosepsis. The overall mortality rate was 11.4 %. White blood cell (WBC) counts (breakpoint,10 x 10(3)/muL) on admission were significantly lower in fatal cases (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 9.6), but no significant differences were observed for other biomarkers. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 28-day survival was associated with WBC count (P < 0.001). The most common capsular type was Ib, followed by type V. Levofloxacin resistance was predominantly identified in type Ib. No significant association was found between capsular type and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Effective prevention of iGBS infections in older individuals requires large-scale surveillance, including environmental factors, and the development of comprehensive and multifaceted prevention strategies for high-risk older populations."
41660626,GDF15 orchestrates mitochondrial-immune crosstalk via SMAD7-HIF-1alpha-PKM2 cascade to attenuate septic liver injury.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure involves pathological crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperinflammation, yet endogenous protective mechanisms remain incompletely defined. This study investigates Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) as a potential regulator of sepsis tolerance. METHODS: Using LPS-challenged mouse endotoxemia and a murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell line model, we assessed GDF15's functional role through: (1) recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 8 (rAAV8)-mediated tissue-specific overexpression, (2) siRNA knockdown, (3) pharmacological modulation (BAY 87-2243/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) inhibitor, Shikonin/PKM2 inhibitor, Asiaticoside/SMAD7 activator), and (4) comprehensive metabolic-inflammatory phenotyping including mitochondrial complex integrity (assessed via UQCRC1, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Core Protein 1), cytokine dynamics (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and lactate metabolism. RESULTS: LPS challenge induced time-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction concurrent with cytokine storms and compensatory GDF15 upregulation in both liver and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific GDF15 overexpression attenuated injury through restored mitochondrial integrity, diminished macrophage infiltration, and reduced systemic inflammation, as evidenced by significantly lower levels of circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6. Mechanistically, GDF15 preserved mitochondrial homeostasis by inducing SMAD7 expression while suppressing HIF-1alpha accumulation and PKM2 nuclear translocation. Pharmacological HIF-1alpha/PKM2 inhibition recapitulated GDF15's protective effects, restoring mitochondrial function and reducing inflammation even in GDF15-deficient models. Clinical analysis of a sepsis patient cohort (n=119) confirmed a significant elevation of circulating GDF15, with its levels strongly correlating with disease severity scores. Critically, SMAD7 activation attenuated HIF-1alpha accumulation and rescued mitochondrial failure independently of GDF15 status. CONCLUSION: GDF15 orchestrates sepsis tolerance through the SMAD7-HIF-1alpha axis, preserving mitochondrial integrity while resolving metabolic-inflammatory dysregulation, notably by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. This study identifies GDF15 as a central guardian of mitochondrial-immune homeostasis in sepsis, positioning it as both a robust severity biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for mitochondrial resuscitation."
31868053,An easy-to-use scoring system for predicting bacteraemia with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales in a low-resistance setting.,2020,"Background: The incidence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCR-E) is increasing and a growing number of patients risk receiving inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment. Published scoring systems for predicting 3GCR-E bacteraemia are mostly based on studies from countries with a high incidence. In this study, we aimed to create an easy-to-use scoring system for predicting bacteraemia with these bacteria in a low-resistance setting.Materials and methods: Factors associated with 3GCR-E were studied retrospectively in a cohort of patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia using uni- and multivariate analysis. A scoring system was constructed and was validated in a separate cohort of patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia.Results: The derivation cohort comprised 625 cases of Enterobacterales bacteraemia. Three variables (previous hospital care abroad, 3GCR-E in a previous blood or urine culture and 3GCR-E in a previous rectal swab culture) were significantly associated with 3GCR-E bacteraemia. A scoring system, where at least one positive parameter equalled a positive score, was studied in the validation cohort, which comprised 675 cases of Enterobacterales bacteraemia. The sensitivity and specificity of the score were 53% and 95%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 38% and 97%, respectively.Conclusions: This study presents an easy-to-use scoring system for predicting bacteraemia with 3GCR-E. The performance of the score is similar to that of several other, more complicated, scoring systems, developed in countries with higher rates of resistance. The minimal extra effort required to use this new score could facilitate its introduction into clinical routine."
15700545,Effects of intratracheal tumor necrosis factor-alpha plasmid vector on lipopolysaccharide lethality and lung injury in mice.,2004,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes acute lung injury (ALI) and contributes to inflammation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, making mechanisms of resistance to LPS critically important in clinical settings. The authors postulated that intratracheal administration of a plasmid (pcDNA3. 0-rTNFalpha) encoding rat tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) would increase resistance of mice to LPS-induced ALI or mortality. They investigated the time course and dose-response for development of LPS-induced ALI in C57/BL6 mice and sought possible protective effects of 100 microg pcDNA3.0-rTNFalpha intratracheally 1, 2, or 3 weeks before LPS challenge. Lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts increased significantly 48 hours after intraperitoneal (IP) LPS challenges. After pcDNA3.0-rTNFalpha pretreatment, mice challenged with LPS had lower lung/body weight ratios than mice treated with pcDNA3.0; however, other indices of lung injury did not differ. Survival of mice challenged with lethal IP LPS 2 weeks after intratracheal pcDNA3.0-rTNFalpha vector improved significantly, compared to mice pretreated with the control vector, pcDNA3.0. However, pcDNA3.0-pretreated mice tolerated LPS challenge less well than saline-pretreated controls. LPS causes neutrophilic lung injury and mortality, but pcDNA3.0-TNFalpha does not prevent ALI due to LPS. Intratracheal pcDNA3.0-rTNFalpha pretreatment significantly improves survival of mice after LPS challenge, compared to those pretreated with pcDNA3.0."
25618639,Detection of biomarkers for inflammatory diseases by an electrochemical immunoassay: the case of neopterin.,2015,"An electrochemical immunoassay for neopterin was developed using recently produced specific antibodies immobilized to protein A-coated magnetic beads in combination with differential pulse voltammetry and screen-printed array of electrodes. Neopterin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as label in a competitive assay format. Multiplexed analysis of neopterin was demonstrated by replacing the traditional ELISA with electrochemical detection and the traditional plastic wells with screen-printed array of electrodes. The optimized electrochemical method, based on polyclonal antibodies, reached a limit of detection of 0.008 ng/mL with an average RSD %=10. Serum samples collected from patients with sepsis, healthy volunteers and other patients without a confirmed clinical diagnosis were also analyzed. The obtained results, compared with those of a commercial ELISA kit, had a significant correlation, showing the possibility to distinguish among the serum samples from ill or healthy subjects."
15756805,[Coagulation tests in septic surgical patients].,2004,"AIM: To determine whether sequential change in coagulation parameters such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelets count and fibrinogen level may predict the outcome of patients in sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort longitudinal study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with positive two or more clinical criteria for sepsis were eligible for the study. Thirty patients were included, 24 male and 6 female. Eight patients survived, while 22 deceased. Median age of survivors was 66 years (range 23-77), and in non-survivors it was 69 years (range 48-79), p=0.37. In 9 patients malignancy was an underlying disease. APACHE II score was calculated at admittance, median value for survivors was 10 (range 7-15) and for non-survivors it was 26 (range 6-35), p=0.001. Calculated MODS score at the time blood cultures was 2 (range 0-9) for survivor and 6.5 (range 2-13) for non-survivors, p=0.007. Blood cultures were taken at the onset of sepsis, and in 29 patients they were positive. Coagulation parameters were measured at admittance, at the onset of sepsis and 48 hours after the introduction of the specific antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Analysis of variance for repeated measurements between survivors and non-survivors has shown that there were no differences in values of coagulation parameters. The only significant difference between these groups of patients was APACHE II and MODS score. In 7 patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<33,000 x 10(9)/L) as a result of irreversible septic shock a clinically visible bleeding was present in only one patient. DISCUSSION: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical-pathological syndrome in which wide-spread intravascular coagulation is induced by procoagulants that are introduced or produced in the blood circulation and overcome the natural anticoagulant mechanisms. DIC causes tissue ischemia from occlusive microthrombi as well as bleeding from both the consumption of platelets and coagulation factors and the anticoagulant effect of products of secondary fibrinolysis. In sepsis, tissue factor which is the most common trigger of DIC can be generated and expressed on membranes of monocytes and endothelial cells during the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The wide-spread generation of thrombi in sepsis induces deposition of fibrin which leads to vessels obstruction and consumption of substantial amounts of haemostatic factors i.e. platelets, fibrinogen, factors V, VIII and others, protein C and antithrombin III (AT III). Intravascular thrombi trigger secretion of tissue plasmin activator (tPA) from endothelial cells which sets of compensatory thrombolysis which may reopen the occluded blood vessels. But byproducts of thrombolysis such as fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products may enhance bleeding by interfering with platelet aggregation, fibrin polymerization and thrombin activity. The typical feature of sepsis is depression of three powerful anticoagulant systems: protein C pathway, AT III pathway and tissue pathway factor inhibitor (TPFI). This sequence of events led us to hypothesize that alterations in coagulation parameters such as PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, platelets count may predict the outcome of disease, as it is well documented that the development of DIC confers prognosis of sepsis. The failure to distinguish survivors from non-survivors by the alteration in the coagulation parameters in this study may be due to a relatively low sample size or to the clinical necessity of an attending physician to substitute the deficient blood or coagulation product. CONCLUSION: The coagulation parameters PT, aPTT, platelet count and fibrinogen level can not serve as predictors of outcome in patients with sepsis. Further studies including more discerning coagulation parameters: AT III, D-dimer, soluble fibrin monomer, thrombin/antithrombin complex, plasmin/antiplasmin complex, fibrinopeptid A, fibrinopeptid B are necessary to evaluate whether these procoagulant and anticoagulant factors may help in predicting outcome and severity of sepsis."
20009673,Acute respiratory distress syndrome in nontrauma surgical patients: a 6-year study.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to increase morbidity but not mortality in trauma patients; however, little is known about the effects of ARDS in nontrauma surgical patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk factors for and outcomes of ARDS in nontrauma surgical patients. STUDY: A prospective observational study was performed in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of an academic tertiary care center. From 2000 to 2005, all nontrauma surgical admissions to the surgical ICU were evaluated daily for ARDS based on predefined diagnostic criteria. Logistic regression analysis identified independent predictors for ARDS and ICU mortality. RESULTS: Of 2,046 patient identified, 125 (6.1%) met criteria for ARDS. The incidence of ARDS declined annually from 12.2% to 2.1% during the study period (p < 0.001). ARDS patients were significantly older (55.4 years vs. 51.8 years, p = 0.014) and more likely to be obese (32% vs. 22%, p = 0.007) than the non-ARDS population. Independent predictors of ARDS included use of pressors (relative risk, RR = 3.30), sepsis (RR = 1.72), and body mass index >or=30 kg/m (RR = 1.57). Independent predictors of ICU mortality included ARDS (RR = 6.88), pressors (RR = 2.85), positive fluid balance (RR = 2.27), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (RR = 1.04), and age (RR = 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike trauma patients, ARDS was an independent predictor of ICU mortality in nontrauma surgical patients, independent of age and disease severity. Nontrauma surgical patients who developed ARDS were older, sicker, and had a longer ICU stay. Independent predictors of ARDS included use of pressors, sepsis, and obesity."

25524453,Evaluation of urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in acute kidney injury: a prospective observational study.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) is an emerging acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarker. We evaluated the performance of urinary TIMP-2 in an adult mixed ICU by comparison with other biomarkers that reflect several different pathways of AKI. METHODS: In this study, we prospectively enrolled 98 adult critically ill patients who had been admitted to the adult mixed ICU. Urinary TIMP-2 and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and erythropoietin (EPO) were measured on ICU admission. We evaluated these biomarkers' capability of detecting AKI and its severity as determined by using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria, as well as its capacity to predict in-hospital mortality. The impact of sepsis, the leading cause of AKI in ICUs, was also evaluated. RESULTS: We found AKI in 42 patients (42.9%). All biomarkers were significantly higher in AKI than in non-AKI. In total, 27 patients (27.6%) developed severe AKI. Urinary TIMP-2 was able to distinguish severe AKI from non-severe AKI with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.90). A total of 41 cases (41.8%) were complicated with sepsis. Although plasma NGAL and IL-6 were increased by sepsis, urinary TIMP-2 and NAG were increased not by sepsis, but by the presence of severe AKI. Plasma EPO was increased only by septic AKI. In-hospital mortality was 15.3% in this cohort. Urinary TIMP-2 and NAG, and plasma NGAL, were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors, although plasma IL-6 and EPO were not. Among the biomarkers, only urinary TIMP-2 was able to predict in-hospital mortality significantly better than serum creatinine. CONCLUSION: Urinary TIMP-2 can detect severe AKI with performance equivalent to plasma NGAL and urinary NAG, with an AUC-ROC value higher than 0.80. Furthermore, urinary TIMP-2 was associated with mortality. Sepsis appeared to have only a limited impact on urinary TIMP-2, in contrast to plasma NGAL."
31855051,Lycopene has a protective effect on septic shock‑induced cardiac injury in rats.,2019,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the cardioprotective effect of lycopene, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect, in a rat sepsis model induced by lypopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: The oxidative stress parameters, antioxidant parameters and cytokine levels with or without lycopene treatment in LPS‑induced septic rats as well as in controls were measured in serum and tissue. Histologic examinations of the cardiac tissues were also performed. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-Whitney U Test was used for analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The data of this study showed that lycopene pretreatment reduced the oxidative stres parametersand , proinflammatory cytokines as well as increased the antoxidant enzyme activities in both serum and cardiac tissues in LPS‑induced septic rats.. Moreover, hyperaemia and haemorrhage in the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium were lower in the lycopene pretreated group as compared to the LPS alone group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lycopene could be beneficial for the prevention of cardiac injury caused by sepsis through reducing the cytokine levels and oxidative stress parameters (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 35)."
15585505,"Anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.",2004,"Owing to the difficulties in identifying anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli in clinical microbiology laboratories, the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of many of these bacteria have been poorly understood. The application of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in characterizing bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating Gram-positive bacilli during a 4-year period is described. The first case of Olsenella uli bacteraemia, in a patient with acute cholangitis, is also reported. Among 165 blood culture isolates of anaerobic, Gram-positive bacilli, 75 were identified as Propionibacterium acnes by phenotypic tests and 21 as members of other anaerobic, non-sporulating Gram-positive bacilli by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of these 96 isolates, 16 (17 %) were associated with cases of clinically significant bacteraemia, among which 10 (63 %) were caused by Eggerthella, four (25 %) by Lactobacillus and one (6 %) by each of Eubacterium tenue and O. uli. Five of the 10 Eggerthella isolates were Eggerthella lenta, whereas the other five belonged to two novel Eggerthella species, with Eggerthella hongkongensis being almost as prevalent as Eggerthella lenta. Underlying disease in the gastrointestinal tract, isolation of Eggerthella and Lactobacillus, and monomicrobial bacteraemia were associated with clinically significant bacteraemia, whereas isolation of P. acnes and polymicrobial bacteraemia were associated with pseudobacteraemia. Most patients with clinically significant bacteraemia had underlying diseases, with diseases in the gastrointestinal tract being most common. The overall mortality rate was 31 %. Immunocompromised patients with clinically significant bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli other than P. acnes should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. The unexpected frequency of isolation of Eggerthella from blood cultures and its association with clinically significant disease suggest that this genus is probably of high pathogenicity. Further studies to look for specific virulence factors are warranted."
19944213,Partial splenectomy prevents splenic sequestration crises in sickle cell disease.,2009,"PURPOSE: Acute splenic sequestrations (SSs) are potentially fatal complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). Total splenectomies in young patients may predispose them to a higher risk of overwhelming infections, whereas partial splenectomy may maintain immunocompetence. We present our series of partial splenectomies in patients with multiple SS episodes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 6 patients who underwent open partial splenectomies for SS. Data on their clinical courses were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: None of the 6 patients had SS postprocedure, down from 2.1 +/- 1.0 (P = .003) sequestrations per year and 3.5 +/- 1.4 (P = .002) total sequestrations per patient. The transfusion requirements were significantly reduced postoperatively (10.2 +/- 5.6 vs 2.0 +/- 3.1 per year; P = .002). There was no increase in the infection-related hospital admissions during the period of follow-up (1.5 +/- 1.8 vs 0.8 +/- 0.8 per year after partial splenectomy; P = .363). The upper pole was preserved in all cases with blood supply off the main splenic artery. CONCLUSIONS: Partial splenectomy decreases the risk of SS in SCD and reduces the need for blood transfusions. Infection rates did not increase after the procedure during the follow-up period. Partial splenectomy should be considered for patients who experience multiple acute SS crises or have long-term transfusion requirements."
20025760,Duration of red blood cell storage and outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery: an association found for pump prime blood.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass in newborns, infants and small children often requires intraoperative red blood cell transfusions to prime the circuit and oxygenator and to replace blood lost during surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of red blood cell storage time prior to transfusion on postoperative morbidity in pediatric cardiac operations. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two consecutive children aged five years or less who underwent cardiac operations using cardiopulmonary bypass and who received red blood cells for priming the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit comprised the blood-prime group. Forty-seven patients receiving red blood cell transfusions after cardiopulmonary bypass were separately analyzed. Patients in the blood-prime group were divided into two groups based on the duration of storage of the red blood cells they received. The newer blood group included patients who received only red blood cells stored for less than or equal to four days and the older blood group included patients who received red blood cells stored for more than four days. RESULTS: Patients in the newer blood group had a significantly lower rate of pulmonary complications (3.5% versus 14.4%; P = 0.011) as well as a lower rate of acute renal failure (0.8% versus 5.2%; P = 0.154) than patients in the older blood group. Major complications (calculated as a composite score based on pulmonary, neurological, and gastroenterological complications, sepsis and acute renal failure) were found in 6.9% of the patients receiving newer blood and 17.1% of the patients receiving older blood (P = 0.027). After adjusting for other possible confounding variables, red blood cell storage time remained an independent predictor of major morbidity. The same association was not found for patients receiving red blood cell transfusions after cardiopulmonary bypass. CONCLUSIONS: The storage time of the red blood cells used for priming the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit in cardiac operations on newborns and young infants is an independent risk factor for major postoperative morbidity. Pulmonary complications, acute renal failure, and infections are the main complications associated with increased red blood cell storage time."
32030040,Superior vena caval thrombosis after a neonatal arterial switch procedure.,2020,"Superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava obstructions were once well-documented complications from the Mustard repair for D-transposition of the great arteries (TGA), occurring in 10%-40% patients; however, they are rarely documented with the current, more common arterial switch operation (ASO). Similarly, SVC thrombosis is an uncommon, severe complication following neonatal cardiac surgery. We report a case of persistent SVC thrombosis, SVC syndrome, and chylothorax arising after ASO, refractory to thrombolysis and stent placement. A 6-day-old neonate with prenatally known TGA underwent an arterial switch procedure. Despite an initially unremarkable postoperative course, he developed respiratory difficulty after starting enteral feeding. Soft-tissue swelling was noted in the neck, chest, and upper face. An SVC thrombus was identified with cardiac catheterization. Multiple thrombolytic modalities were attempted. His postoperative course was further complicated by recurrent chylothoraces, respiratory failure, sepsis, anasarca, and renal failure. He was eventually transferred to a larger center for a special lymphatics evaluation, where two lymphovenous anastomoses were unsuccessful. He was sent to his home hospital, where he died from extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella sepsis. Early diagnosis of SVC syndrome and prompt thrombolysis may prevent the complications encountered in this patient. More research is needed in neonatal thrombolysis and anticoagulation."
31851562,Intrauterine infection caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella: a literature review.,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although nontyphoidal Salmonella infections have a prevalence of 0.2-1.8%. It is mostly described in veterinary medicine; it could be responsible for severe intra-amniotic infections in humans. The objective of this review is to describe the clinical and microbiological aspects of intrauterine infection (IUI) caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella. METHODS: We reported a case analysis and subsequently conducted a systematic literature review of IUI caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella between 1966 and 2018. RESULTS: In literature nine cases have been reported, and were confirmed by the identification of a nontyphoidal Salmonella in the biological samples. Our review reveals severe clinical presentations in pregnant women. Indeed, sepsis, spontaneous abortions, and fatal outcomes for fetuses were described in 90, 60, and 80% of the cases, respectively. The major clinical symptoms were in majority acute, with high fever, abdominal pain, metrorrhagia, and premature membranes ruptures. Nulliparity is a risk factor and the prognosis depends on the pregnancy stage. All mothers received antibiotics and their outcomes were favorable. CONCLUSIONS: Nontyphoidal Salmonella infections can be responsible for severe pregnancy complications. Considering the severe neonatal prognosis, in case of a history of diarrhea and/or sepsis, a search for this pathogen should be considered, and a preventive strategy could be discussed during pregnancy."
19933305,Atypical presentation of an apical pseudoaneurysm in a patient on prolonged left ventricular mechanical support.,2010,"Prolonged support with left ventricular assist system (LVAS) increases the risk of device-related infection. We experienced a rare complication of LVAS: an infectious aneurysm at the apical cannula, which appeared with atypical presentation. A 27-year-old male, who developed acute aggravation of dilated cardiomyopathy, was placed on extra-corporeal type LVAS. Six months later, the patient suffered from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis that lasted for as long as three months despite intensive antibiotic therapy. At 17 months after the implantation, he presented with obstructive ileus. Monthly assessment with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) did not document any abnormalities around the ventricle. A contrast computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a huge apical aneurysm protruding into the preperitoneal space. The aneurysm oppressed the transverse colon, resulting in obstructive ileus. Aneurysmectomy was carried out and MRSA was identified from the resected tissue. We reached the precise diagnosis with a CT-scan, although routine assessment with TTE failed to reveal abnormalities. Knowledge of this complication is essential in LVAS management. This is certainly rare, but possibly occurs in all the patients on prolonged LVAS support. Early and accurate diagnosis together with aggressive intervention would bring favorable outcome in such serious cases."
20032961,Acute kidney injury in non-severe pneumonia is associated with an increased immune response and lower survival.,2010,"While sepsis is a leading cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients, the relationship between immune response and acute kidney injury in less severely ill patients with infection is not known. Here we studied the epidemiology, 1-year mortality, and immune response associated with acute kidney injury in 1836 hospitalized patients with community-acquired severe and non-severe pneumonia. Acute kidney injury developed in 631 patients of whom 329 had severe and 302 had non-severe sepsis. Depending on the subgroup classification, 16-25% of the patients with non-severe pneumonia also developed acute kidney injury. In general, patients with acute kidney injury were older, had more comorbidity, and had higher biomarker concentrations (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, D-dimer) even among patients without severe sepsis. The risk of death associated with acute kidney injury varied when assessed by Gray's survival model and after adjusting for differences in age, gender, ethnicity, and comorbidity. This risk was significantly higher immediately after hospitalization but gradually fell over time in the overall cohort and in those with non-severe pneumonia. A significantly higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.29) was also present in those never admitted to an intensive care unit. Hence acute kidney injury is common even among patients with non-severe pneumonia and is associated with higher immune response and an increased risk of death."
25729865,[Is effective a shortened surveillance system of bloodstream infection?].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Surveillance is necessary for bloodstream infection control. Daily monitoring of the central venous catheter (CVC) use, a time-demanding process, is the standard denominator to calculate the infection rate; surveillance of only one day per week has been proposed as alternative. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether surveillance of one day per week is similar to daily monitoring in a second-level hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Daily monitoring of CVC utilization ratio was done during nine weeks in four locations of a second-level hospital. For each day, proportional differences respect to the global CVC utilization ratio was estimated. An ANOVA test was done to find differences between each weekday. RESULTS: CVC usage surveillance was performed for 9 weeks, so nine determinations were obtained for each weekday. No significant differences were found between each day (F = 2.20, p = 0.056). The lowest sampling discrepancy was found on Wednesdays. CONCLUSIONS: According to previous studies, and our own data, monitoring the CVC use one day per week is a reasonable alternative to the daily surveillance."
31836349,Prehospital shock index to assess 28-day mortality for septic shock.,2020,"CONTEXT: In the prehospital setting, early identification of septic shock (SS) with high risk of mortality aims to initiate early treatments and to decide delivery unit (emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU)). In this context, there is a need for a prognostic measure of severity and death in order to early detect patients with a higher risk of pejorative evolution. In this study, we describe the association between prehospital shock index (SI) and mortality at day 28 of patients with SS initially cared for in the prehospital setting by a mobile intensive care unit (MICU). METHODS: Patients with SS cared for by a MICU between January 2016 and May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Using propensity score, the association between SI and mortality was assessed by Odd Ratio (OR) with 95 percent confidence interval [95 CI]. RESULTS: One-hundred and fourteen patients among which 78 males (68%) were analysed. The mean age was 71 +/- 14 years old. SS was mainly associated with pulmonary (55%), digestive (20%) or urinary (11%) infection. Overall mortality reached 33% (n = 38) at day 28. Median SI [interquartile range] differed between alive and deceased patients: 0.73 [0.61-1.00] vs 0.80 [0.66-1.10], p < 0.001*). After adjusting for confounding factors, the OR of SI > 0.9 was 1.17 [1.03-1.32]. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report an association between prehospital SI and mortality of patients with prehospital SS. A SI > 0.9 is a readily available tool correlated with increased mortality of patients with SS initially cared for in the prehospital setting."
20464329,Bloodstream infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae: risk factors for multidrug-resistance.,2009,"This prospective case-control study was conducted from October 2003 to June 2007 to evaluate risk factors for multidrug resistance among extended-spectrum-b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. (ESBL-EK) isolates in blood cultures. All adult patients (>18 years old) whose blood cultures grew ESBL-EK during the study period were included. An ESBL-EK isolate was defined as MDR if it was resistant to at least one member of following two classes of antibiotics: aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, or netilmycin) and fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin). Case patients were those with a MDR ESBL-EK isolate, and control patients were those with a non-MDR ESBL-EK isolate. A total of 94 bloodstream infections, including 37 (39,4%) bloodstream infections with ESBL-producing E. coli and 57 (60,6%) with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae,in 86 patients were enrolled. Thirty episodes (31.9%) were due to MDR ESBL-EK. The only independent risk factor for MDR ESBL-EK was duration of hospitalization before bacteraemia (OR 3.88; 95% CI 1.55-9.71; p=0.004). The rate of multidrug resistance among ESBL-EK bloodstream isolates was high, and duration of hospitalization before bacteraemia was the only indeepended risk factor for the MDR ESBL-EK bloodstream infections."
25607269,sRAGE in septic shock: a potential biomarker of mortality.,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and understand the clinical implications of the plasma levels of a soluble isoform of a receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) in different stages of sepsis. METHODS: Serum sRAGE values in patients who were divided into intensive care unit control, severe sepsis, septic shock and recovery from septic shock groups were statistically analyzed to assess quantity (Kruskal-Wallis), variability (Levine test) and correlation (Spearman rank test) with certain inflammatory mediators (IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, MCP-1, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha). RESULTS: No changes in sRAGE levels were observed among the groups; however, the septic shock group showed differences in the variability of sRAGE compared to the other groups. A positive correlation with all the inflammatory mediators was reported in the septic shock group. CONCLUSION: sRAGE levels are associated with worse outcomes in patients with septic shock. However, a statistical correlation analysis with other proinflammatory cytokines indicated that the pathways leading to those outcomes are different depending on the sRAGE levels. Future studies to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms involving sRAGE in models of sepsis are of great clinical importance for the safe handling of this biomarker."
31850123,Giant Squamous Cell Carcinoma on Chronic Lichen Planus on the Ankle - A Case Report and Short Literature Review.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common malignancy of skin. Although a major risk factor is a chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation, preexistent chronic inflammatory disorders may also possess an increased risk for SCC. That is not the case for cutaneous lichen planus in contrast to oral lichen planus and oral SCC. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an 87-year-old Caucasian woman presenting with a giant verrucous tumour on the left ankle. She suffered from long-standing disseminated lichen planus. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of SCC on partly verrucous lichen planus. The course was complicated due to sepsis. An emergency transfemoral amputation became necessary. The patients survived and could be released into her nursery. A literature review underlined the rarity of SCC on lichen planus of the skin. Most of these rare cases were in patients in their second half of life on the lower legs. Hypertrophic lichen planus was overrepresented. CONCLUSIONS: Although very rare by number, SCC can complicate lichen planus and lead to the life-threatening situation. Atypical verrucous lesions on lichen planus warrant a histologic analysis. Surgery is the treatment of choice for cutaneous SCC."
41422100,Machine learning-based prediction of mortality and multidrug-resistant infection risks in ICU patients with suspected infection: a prospective national multicenter cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Suspected infection can progress to sepsis or septic shock, contributing to a high mortality rate among patients admitted to ICU. However, the characteristics of suspected infection remain incompletely defined. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models to identify independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection in patients with suspected infection upon ICU admission in mainland China. METHODS: We prospectively collected medical data from patients with suspected infection admitted to ICUs across mainland China between July 2021 and December 2022. Patients were randomly allocated to a training cohort and a validation cohort at a 7:3 ratio. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified risk factors and constructed predictive models for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection. The performance of models developed by logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and gradient boosting machine was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), Brier score, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), the Youden index, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: A total of 2963 patients from 67 hospitals in mainland China were enrolled. The most common infection sites were the lung (79.28%), bloodstream (17.11%) and abdomen (16.54%). The overall mortality rate was 10.90%. The logistic regression model demonstrated the best performance for mortality prediction (AUC 0.87) and identified the following risk factors: surgery (2.39, 95CI% 1.60-3.56, p < 0.01), APACHE II score (1.51, 95CI% 1.44-1.58, p < 0.01), and bloodstream infection (2.08, 95CI% 1.40-3.10, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors of mortality. For multidrug resistant infection prediction, the logistic regression model also showed the highest discriminative ability (AUC 0.86). Independent risk factors included APACHE II score (1.06, 95%CI 1.03-1.1, p < 0.01), bloodstream infection (1.82, 95%CI 1.26-2.61, p < 0.01), urinary infection (3.42, 95%CI 2.20-5.30, p < 0.01), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.67, 95%CI 7.91-17.21, p < 0.01), Acinetobacter baumannii (85.22, 95%CI 50.03-145.18, p < 0.01), and Enterococcus faecium (22.10, 95%CI 8.58-56.93, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was the most common infection among ICU patients in mainland China. Using machine learning techniques, we developed and validated predictive models that identified independent risk factors for mortality and multidrug-resistant infection upon ICU admission.

25592810,Evaluation of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome caused by group B streptococcus in adults in Japan between 2009 and 2013.,2015,"Infection with Streptococcus agalactiae has long been recognized in infants. In recent years, S. agalactiae is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among adults and among those with underlying medical condition. Several cases of GBS infection and more fulminant disease similar to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome have recently been reported. We report here that 19 S. agalactiae strains were isolated from streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome cases involving adult patients in Japan between 2009 and 2013. The average age of the patients was 66.3 years. At least one underlying disease was present in 47.4% (9/19) of the patients. The most prevalent serotype among these strains was Ib. All serotype Ib strains belonged to clonal complex 10 and were ciprofloxacin resistant. In contrast, all strains were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, panipenem, and linezolid. The characteristic type distributions of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome isolates differed between isolates obtained from vaginal swabs of women and infants with invasive infections."
15592951,Cardiac troponin-I as a marker of myocardial dysfunction in children with septic shock.,2004,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiac depression is well known in severe sepsis and septic shock. Our aim was to investigate the incidence of myocardial ischaemia as shown by cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels in patients with septic shock and to evaluate the correlation with myocardial dysfunction measured by echocardiography. METHODS: The study was performed in the paediatric intensive care unit in Dicle University Hospital, Turkey, between January 2001 and December 2002. Patients in septic shock, with a mean age of 6.4 +/- 2.8 months, were simultaneously submitted to a two-dimensional echocardiogram and biochemical investigation on admission. RESULTS: The mean serum cTnI level of the patients was 3.1 +/- 2.6 ng/ml (0.01-9.80 ng/ml) and the mean LVEF value was calculated as 48% +/- 11%. 21 patients (75%) had a cTnI level >/=0.6 ng/ml, and 15 patients (54%) had a LVEF <0.5. For cTnI levels >/=0.6 ng/ml, sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 46.2%, and positive and negative predictive values were 66.7% and 85.7% respectively. For cTnI values >/=2.0 ng/ml, sensitivity and specificity were 86.7% and 76.9%, and positive and negative predictive values were 81.3% and 83.3%, respectively. There was a statistically significant relationship between LV dysfunction and cTnI positivity (r2 = 0.316, p = 0.002). No significant difference was found for the cTnI levels >/=0.6 ng/ml between non-survivors and survivors (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: Myocardial ischaemia and cell injury seem to be common in patients with septic shock and correlate with left ventricular dysfunction. Measurement of cTnI may be an easy and practical tool for monitoring cardiac damage in critically ill septic patients."
41602763,Dysbiosis and metabolic pathway shifts in the gut microbiome of children with sepsis: a comparative analysis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The newly published Phoenix Sepsis Score in 2024 for assessing sepsis in children mainly focuses on respiratory, cardiological, coagulation and neurological indicators, whereas the gut microbiome also plays key roles in the occurrence and progression of sepsis. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific biomarkers in gut microbiome are associated with disease progression. This study aimed to explore the differences in gut microbiome diversity, composition and function between septic and healthy children, and to establish correlations with clinical indicators and outcomes, providing new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. RESULTS: Analysis of gut microbiome was performed in 20 sepsis children and 9 healthy controls aged between 3 and 18 years old. The anal swab samples were analyzed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Significant differences were observed in alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiome between sepsis group and healthy controls groups. Especially, Shannon diversity was significantly correlated with white blood cell count, serum lactate, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay and length of hospital stay (all R > 0, p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were both dominant in most of children in SG and HC groups, while three in SG showed extremely low combined abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (<10%), which might be associated with chemistry therapy and death outcome. Bacteria associated with nosocomial infections, including genus taxa Acinetobacter, Prevotella, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and Corynebacterium, can be dominant (relative abundance>70%) in sepsis group, which were absent in healthy control group. Enterococcus abundance not only predicted sepsis risk (AUC = 0.85) but also was correlated with 28-day mortality (R > 0, p = 0.004). Gene function prediction based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated significant differences profile in SG and sepsis-deaths groups. The enriched gut microbiome genes were related to cellular proliferation, energy metabolism, signal transduction, the oxidative stress response and arginine metabolism. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in diversity, taxa composition and gene function in the gut microbiome existed between septic and healthy children. The associations between gut microbiome dysbiosis and clinical indicators were identified. Enterococcus could be a biomarker to predict sepsis risk."
15616813,Pseudoeosinophilia associated with malaria infection determined in the Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer.,2005,"Hemozoin is known to be an end product of hemoglobin digestion by the malaria parasite. Hemozoin is a birefringent crystal, and thus hemozoin-containing white blood cells (WBCs) may show the atypical light scattering pattern. The purpose of this study was to investigate pseudoeosinophilia associated with malaria infection using a Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). The study group included 16 patients with malaria infection. Of these, 38% showed erroneously high eosinophil counts and atypical eosinophil distributions in the WBCs scattergram, which was due to the presence of hemozoin-containing neutrophils. In two patients, their erroneously high eosinophil counts declined as the parasitemia decreased with treatment. In conclusion, hematologists should consider the possibility of pseudoeosinophilia as a result of hemozoin-containing WBCs and confirm the WBC differential count by microscopy in cases of malaria infection."
31926640,Validation of the Larissa Heart Failure Risk Score for risk stratification in acute heart failure.,2020,"BACKGROUND: The LHFRS is a simple score derived from three factors (history of hypertension, history of coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, and red blood cell distribution width) deployed for the risk stratification of AHF in Greek population. This study aimed to validate the Larissa Heart Failure Risk Score (LHFRS) in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) in a Japanese population. METHODS: We performed post-hoc analysis of 1670 consecutive patients enrolled in the REALITY-AHF. In all, 964 patients were finally enrolled. Exclusion criteria included patients with anemia, malignancies and sepsis. The primary outcome was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality and/or heart failure readmission, and the secondary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The median admission LHFRS value was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0-2). During a median follow-up of 365 (IQR: 161-365) days, the primary and secondary outcomes were observed in 321 and 157 patients, respectively. LHFRS was an independent predictor of both the primary (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-point increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 [1.04-1.32], p = 0.011), and the secondary outcomes (1.31 [1.12-1.55], p = 0.001). Patients with higher LHFRS scores (>/=2) exhibited significantly worse outcomes than those with lower scores (<2) both for the primary outcome (1.40 [1.07-1.83], p = 0.014) and the secondary outcome (1.60 [1.09-2.34], p = 0.015). Additionally, LHFRS revealed an excellent goodness of fit (observed versus predicted outcomes) for predicting both the primary and the secondary outcomes (p > 0.99 and p = 0.99, respectively). CONCLUSION: The simple LHFRS was proved as a reliable predictor of outcomes in patients with AHF."
41466668,Acute kidney injury in chronic liver disease: Causes and prevalence in a cross-sectional study.,2025,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a prevalent condition with significant systemic complications and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication that worsens prognosis. This prospective observational study, conducted from November 2019 to June 2021 at G.R. Medical College, Gwalior, included 100 CLD patients. The study found that 30% of patients developed AKI, with sepsis as the most common precipitating factor. Severe renal impairment (Stage 3 AKI) was present in 46.6% of AKI cases. Alcohol was the leading etiology of CLD and the timely diagnosis and management of AKI in CLD patients are essential to improving outcomes and reducing mortality."
41416657,Megacystis-Megacolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome with Intestinal Neuronal Dysplasia: Expanding the Phenotypic Spectrum.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Megacystitis-megacolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome is a phenotypic variant of visceral neuromuscular dysfunction. Megacystitis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome is a recognized entity. However, presentation with megacolon is rarely reported, with only one case documented in association with intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) and malrotation. CASE REPORT: We report such a case of Megacystitis-megacolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis coexisting with IND type B and atypical malrotation in a 2-year-old male, presented with intestinal obstruction. Despite multiple surgical interventions, the patient remained TPN-dependent and eventually succumbed to sepsis. Histopathology evaluation revealed hyperganglionosis, including the presence of immature and giant ganglion cells, which supported the diagnosis of IND type B, alongside the features of visceral myopathy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity posed by overlapping features of megacolon and MMIHS, especially when hyperganglionosis was present. Our case highlights the need for clinico-pathological correlation and genetic analysis in diagnosing complex pediatric motility disorders."
15700847,Incidence and management of proven and probable fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia: a single center experience.,2004,"The incidence of fungal infections and the role of liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) in proven and probable infections were evaluated in acute leukemic patients, intolerant to conventional amphotericin B. During 1999-2002, 307 febrile episodes occurred in 231 patients. Fungi were responsible for 3% of bloodstream infections. Ambisome was employed in 5 fungal sepsis (1 Candida albicans, 1 C. famata, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. krusei, 1 Geotrichum capitatum) 2 Aspergillosis, 2 probable fungal pneumonia cases. A favorable response was achieved in 78% of patients (4 fungemia, 2 aspergillosis, 1 probable), an unfavorable response in 1 C. krusei fungemia and in 1 probable pneumonia. Our antimicrobial pattern documented a high resistance rate to azoles. We concluded that Ambisome is an effective and well tolerated agent and its introduction has changed the outcome for many patients, although in some refractory diseases other strategies must be considered."
41483497,Elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling correlates with myocardial PANoptosis in septic rats.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction driven by dysregulated host responses to infection. While PANoptosis-a coordinated cell death pathway-has emerged as a critical process in inflammatory diseases, its role in sepsis and regulatory interactions with the miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis remains unexplored. This study aimed to determine PANoptosis activation in sepsis, elucidate the mechanistic involvement of miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB in PANoptosis regulation, and assess associated pathological outcomes. METHODS: Cross-dataset analyses revealed functional linkages between miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling and PANoptotic pathways. Clinical validation included serum collection from sepsis patients and healthy controls, with miR-145 quantified via qPCR and PANoptosis-related proteins measured by ELISA. A rat sepsis model was established via cecal ligation and puncture, followed by miR-145 expression profiling, PANoptotic factor detection, and myocardial histopathological evaluation using HE/TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Results demonstrated significant upregulation of miR-145, TLR4, NF-kappaB, PANoptotic markers, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis patients versus controls. CLP rats exhibited parallel increases in these biomarkers alongside pronounced myocardial injury, including histopathological disruption and elevated apoptosis. Correlation analyses confirmed miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB axis activation as a key modulator of PANoptosis and tissue damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of PANoptosis activation in sepsis, indicating a correlative link with elevated miR-145/TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling. These findings propose a novel pathogenic framework for sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and highlight therapeutic targets for modulating inflammatory cell death pathways."
41668768,Role of DNA methylation in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression in neonates with late-onset sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major health issue, particularly in resource-poor areas. This study aimed to assess the role of DNA methylation in regulating the inflammatory cytokine expression in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing neonates with LOS (n=42) before and after 72 hours of antibiotic treatment (n=25) to healthy controls (HC) (n=42). We analysed DNA methylation patterns and inflammatory cytokine expression levels in both groups. RESULTS: DNA methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation in pro-inflammatory genes and hypermethylation in anti-inflammatory genes in LOS neonates. These patterns were shifted in follow-up group, with significant changes in inflammatory marker levels, including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta. The gene expression results aligned with the DNA methylation findings, indicating that changes in the expression of inflammatory genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) are influenced by DNA methylation. The results were further validated through an analysis of plasma cytokine levels. LOS cases showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, except IL-10. In the follow-up group, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Understanding these molecular changes could lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing neonatal sepsis."
19959544,"Bacteraemia due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) in cancer patients: clinical features, risk factors, molecular epidemiology and outcome.",2010,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical features, risk factors, molecular epidemiology and outcome of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) bacteraemia in hospitalized cancer patients. METHODS: Episodes of ESBL-EC bacteraemia were compared with a susceptible control group in a 3 year prospective study. ESBL-EC strains were studied by PCR and isoelectric focusing, and molecular typing was performed by PFGE. RESULTS: Out of 531 episodes of bacteraemia, 135 were caused by E. coli. Seventeen of these cases involved ESBL-EC-producing strains (12.6%). In the multivariate analysis, female gender [odds ratio (OR) 3.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-11.4] and previous antibiotic therapy (OR 3.22; 95% CI 1.00-10.3) were found to be independent risk factors for ESBL acquisition. An analysis of ESBL-EC isolates revealed a polyclonal distribution with CTX-M predominance (59%). Patients with ESBL-EC bacteraemia were more likely to have received an inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy (65% versus 6%; P = 0.000), and the time to adequate therapy was longer in this group (0 versus 1.50 days; P = 0.000). The overall mortality rate was 22%, ranging from 20% to 35% (P = 0.20). Risk factors for mortality were solid tumour (OR 19.41; 95% CI 4.66-80.83), corticosteroid therapy (OR 3.04 95% CI 1.05-8.81) and intensive care unit admission (OR 248.24, 95% CI 18.49-3332.14). In neutropenic patients, ESBL-EC bacteraemia was associated with poorer outcome and a higher overall mortality rate (37.5% versus 6.5%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, ESBL-EC bacteraemia is frequent among cancer patients, especially in those exposed to antibiotic pressure. All ESBL-EC strains were unrelated and most of them carried a CTX-M group enzyme. Patients with ESBL-EC bacteraemia received inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy more frequently than patients carrying a susceptible strain, but significant differences in mortality could not be demonstrated."
31863173,Genetic variant rs16944 in IL1B gene is a risk factor for early-onset sepsis susceptibility and outcome in preterm infants.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-1-B (IL1B) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between IL1B-511G/A polymorphism and susceptibility and outcome of early-onset sepsis (EOS) in preterm infants. METHODS: DNA was extracted from the buccal swabs of 471 (285 with EOS and 186 control) preterm infants. Genotypes of rs16944 polymorphism were determined with real-time PCR method. RESULTS: We found statistically significant higher frequency of IL1B-511AA genotype in EOS group than in control group (p = 0.012). Also, IL1B-511AA genotype is statistically significantly more frequent in patients with lethal EOS outcome (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Genotype IL1B-511AA was associated with susceptibility to EOS and it is a significant predictor of lethal outcome in preterm infants with EOS."
41647308,Infective endocarditis in children with chronic intestinal failure.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but serious complication in pediatric patients with chronic intestinal failure (IF) dependent on long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) via central venous access devices (CVADs). This study aimed to investigate the incidence, clinical features and outcomes of IE in children with chronic IF at a single institution. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in pediatric patients (0-18 years) with chronic IF requiring PN for > 60 days during 2013-2024. IE was diagnosed using modified Duke criteria. RESULTS: Five IE episodes occurred in 4 patients out of 29 with chronic IF (median follow-up 9 years). The overall incidence was 0.144 per 1000 catheter days (5155.2 per 100,000 person-years). Compared with patients without IE, those with IE had longer catheter durations (median 2941.5 vs. 443.0 days, p = 0.006); more central line-associated bloodstream infections (median 8 vs. 1, p = 0.0015); higher prevalence of catheter-related venous thrombosis (100 % vs. 12 %, p = 0.001); and were more likely to have dysmotility (75 % vs. 16 %, p = 0.02). IE resolved with antimicrobial therapy in all cases. During a median follow-up of 2.2 years, one patient died from superior vena cava obstruction, sepsis and multiorgan failure while awaiting transplantation; one achieved enteral autonomy and was weaned off PN; and two underwent successful intestinal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Though uncommon, IE poses significant risks in pediatric IF; early cardiac surveillance in high-risk patients may facilitate timely diagnosis and intervention."
41399335,Lactate/Albumin Ratio vs. NEWS-Lactate in Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury Prognosis; Comment on Le Xuan at al. Study.,2025,"A study by Le Xuan et al. suggested that the lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) may aid in predicting sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. However, overlapping receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve confidence intervals, creatinine-only acute kidney injury (AKI) definitions, and single-point biomarker assessments limit interpretation. Given its single-centre retrospective design, broader validation with dynamic biomarkers and kidney-specific comparators is needed before the LAR can be integrated into sepsis risk stratification."
15646094,[Burn injuries--contemporary and previous findings].,2004,"The study compares findings in fatal burn injuries with respect to age, sex, cause of death, survival period, and complications leading to death. These findings were collected at Department of Forensic Medicine, 3rd Faculty of Medicine in Prague during the periods 1966-1974, 1976-1979, 1981-1989 and 1993-2002. The number of occupational and domestic burn injuries has decreased in recent years. The following reflect some of the current trends and situations: Women are prevalent in the group of patients older than 65. Occupational injuries occurred a most exclusively in men with the average age of 42.6 (median 38 years). Suicide rates have increased to 5.4% (with two thirds of them committed by men). The most common cause of injury was due to combustibles and explosives. Injuries caused by improper use of gas and electrical appliances have increased recently. Survival periods have been extended significantly. They have risen to 20.1 days in the age group 15-64 years with burns of 57.3% of body surface area of 2nd ad 3rd degree in comparison with 16 days in patients with burns of 48.4% of body surface area in 1976-1979. In patients over 65 years with burns of 33.9% of body surface area, the survival period has been extended to 16.8 days in comparison with 13.2 days in cases with total burn skin area of 24.8%. In 224 victims who died between 1993-2002, burn shock was diagnosed in 25.8% of the cases, sepsis in 30.3%, pneumonia in 54.4%, cardiac failure in 28.1%, and pulmonary embolism in 7.5%. Multiple organ failure occurred predominantly in the age group 45-64 years representing 27.5% and myocardial infarction in victims above 65 was 13.9%. Thrombo-embolic complications in cases where the victim was less than 44 years of age were extremely rare."
41456283,[Cerebral and extrancerebral complications combined with otogenic meningitis with various outcomes].,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To increase the effectiveness of treatment of patients with otogenic meningitis based on the analysis of the frequency and structure of cerebral complications (CC) and extracerebral complications (ECC) with different outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis of variants of the clinical course of otogenic purulent meningitis OPM in 51 patients with the isolation of combined CC and ECC, the immediate causes of death, was carried out. RESULTS: OPM in 66.7+/-6.6% of cases was accompanied by combined central nervous system diseases, which in descending order included encephalitis, epidural empyema, thrombophlebitis of the cerebral sinuses and intracerebral abscess. In case of fatal outcomes of OPM, compared with favorable ones, the frequency of CC increased significantly in association with acute purulent otitis media (APOM) - from 50.0+/-10.7% to 92.9+/-8.5 (p</=0.02), to a lesser extent with exacerbation of chronic purulent otitis media (CPOM) - from 71.4+/-12.1% to 80.0+/-17.9. Sepsis was detected in all fatal cases, with favorable cases - in 54.5+/-10.6% in association with APOM and 21.4+/-11.0% with CPOM (p</=0.05). Infectious-toxic shock (40%), bilateral focal-drain pneumonia (33.3%) and cerebral edema (26.7%) were noted as the direct causes of death. CONCLUSION: An analysis of the clinical course and thanatogenesis of OPM allows us to state that combined CC and ECC significantly increase the risk of fatal complications."
20444470,Nitric oxide and redox regulation in the liver: Part I. General considerations and redox biology in hepatitis.,2010,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are created in normal hepatocytes and are critical for normal physiologic processes, including oxidative respiration, growth, regeneration, apoptosis, and microsomal defense. When the levels of oxidation products exceed the capacity of normal antioxidant systems, oxidative stress occurs. This type of stress, in the form of ROS and RNS, can be damaging to all liver cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells, through induction of inflammation, ischemia, fibrosis, necrosis, apoptosis, or through malignant transformation by damaging lipids, proteins, and/or DNA. In Part I of this review, we will discuss basic redox biology in the liver, including a review of ROS, RNS, and antioxidants, with a focus on nitric oxide as a common source of RNS. We will then review the evidence for oxidative stress as a mechanism of liver injury in hepatitis (alcoholic, viral, nonalcoholic). In Part II of this review, we will review oxidative stress in common pathophysiologic conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, iron overload, Wilson's disease, sepsis, and acetaminophen overdose. Finally, biomarkers, proteomic, and antioxidant therapies will be discussed as areas for future therapeutic interventions."
27140801,Population pharmacokinetic analysis of thrombomodulin alfa to support dosing rationale in patients with renal impairment.,2015,"Thrombomodulin alfa is a soluble recombinant human thrombomodulin that was reported to enhance the reversal of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in subjects with sepsis or hematologic malignancy and reduce mortality in subjects with sepsis and DIC. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of thrombomodulin alfa was performed based on rich samples collected in 24 healthy subjects (0.02 and 0.06 mg/kg) and sparse samples collected in 368 subjects with sepsis and DIC (0.06 mg/kg). Sources of variability (baseline characteristics, markers of renal/liver function, hematocrit, and disease severity) were explored using non-linear mixed effect modeling to support dosing rationale in patients with sepsis and DIC. Plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin alfa were best fitted with a one-compartment model. Body weight and creatinine clearance were important covariates describing the PK of thrombomodulin alfa. Typical CL values in patients with normal renal function, or mild, moderate and severe renal impairment were 0.158, 0.145, 0.128, and 0.105 L/h, respectively. Based on simulations, a 0.06 mg/kg dosing of thrombomodulin alfa is expected to result in drug exposure within the therapeutic range of the product (300-5,400 ng/mL), with minimum risks of bleeding in patient with normal and impaired renal functions."
25527026,Gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome in Gottingen minipigs (Sus scrofa domestica).,2014,"In the absence of supportive care, exposing Gottingen minipigs to gamma-radiation doses of less than 2 Gy achieves lethality due to hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome. Doses of 2 to 5 Gy are associated with an accelerated hematopoietic syndrome, characterized by villus blunting and fusion, the beginning of sepsis, and a mild transient reduction in plasma citrulline concentration. We exposed male Gottingen minipigs (age, 5 mo; weight, 9 to 11 kg) to gamma-radiation doses of 5 to 12 Gy (total body; (60)Co, 0.6 Gy/min) to test whether these animals exhibit classic gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS). After exposure, the minipigs were monitored for 10 d by using clinical signs, CBC counts, and parameters associated with the development of the gastrointestinal syndrome. Gottingen minipigs exposed to gamma radiation of 5 to 12 Gy demonstrate a dose-dependent occurrence of all parameters classically associated with acute GI-ARS. These results suggest that Gottingen minipigs may be a suitable model for studying GI-ARS after total body irradiation, but the use of supportive care to extend survival beyond 10 d is recommended. This study is the first step toward determining the feasibility of using Gottingen minipigs in testing the efficacy of candidate drugs for the treatment of GI-ARS after total body irradiation."
20035019,Decline of EMRSA-16 amongst methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus causing bacteraemias in the UK between 2001 and 2007.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: Between 1998 and 2000, 95.6% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemias in the UK were due to two epidemic strains, namely EMRSA-15 or EMRSA-16 (60.2% and 35.4%, respectively). We sought to determine the proportions of these strains before and after the general decline in MRSA bacteraemia that began around 2004. METHODS: Consecutive MRSA isolates collected in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007 by the BSAC Bacteraemia Surveillance Programme were categorized to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) clonal complex and to SCCmec type by PCR. MICs were determined by the BSAC method. Data trends were tested for significance using a generalized linear regression model. RESULTS: Collectively, EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 consistently accounted for approximately 95% of MRSA studied between 2001 and 2007, but the proportions of EMRSA-16 declined from 21.4% in 2001 to 9% in 2007 (P < 0.05), whilst the proportion of EMRSA-15 rose commensurately, accounting for 85% of MRSA in 2007. Ciprofloxacin and erythromycin resistance were common amongst both EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16. CONCLUSIONS: EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 remain the main MRSA strains in bacteraemia in the UK, but the proportion of EMRSA-16 declined from the late 1990 s, thus preceding the general decline in MRSA bacteraemias that began in the middle of the present decade."
20099725,Eustachian valve endocarditis: a rare complication of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement.,2009,"Eustachian valve (EV) endocarditis is extremely rare and often difficult to diagnose. An extensive review of the English literature has shown no report of EV endocarditis as a complication of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD). A rare case is reported following AICD placement that was diagnosed by clinical findings of sepsis and positive blood cultures, and supported (using transesophageal echocardiography) by the presence of vegetations attached to the EV. Previously reported cases of EV endocarditis are reviewed, and its significance discussed in the setting of an increased use of AICD."
41432367,Bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis from asymptomatic Aspergillus niger fungal infective endocarditis in the immunosuppressed patient: A case report.,2025,"RATIONALE: Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis (EFE) is a rare but sight- and life-threatening condition that often arises in immunocompromised patients. While Aspergillus fumigatus is the predominant pathogen, Aspergillus niger-associated endocarditis leading to bilateral EFE has not been previously reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old woman with a history of two renal transplants over the past 30 years, along with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, presented with rapidly progressive bilateral visual impairment, beginning with acute vision loss and ocular pain in the right eye, followed by involvement of the left eye within two days. She had no systemic symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: Initial aqueous humor analysis, including Gram staining, fungal culture, and viral PCR, yielded negative results. As the disease progressed to bilateral involvement within 2 days, a diagnostic vitrectomy was performed. Vitreous sampling demonstrated fungal hyphae, and culture confirmed Aspergillus niger. Transesophageal echocardiography further revealed mitral valve vegetation, establishing the diagnosis of fungal infective endocarditis with bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received empiric intravitreal antibiotics and antivirals initially, followed by diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and systemic antifungal therapy after identification of Aspergillus. Mitral valve replacement surgery was subsequently performed. OUTCOMES: Despite surgical intervention and systemic antifungal treatment, the patient developed disseminated fungal sepsis and died 2 weeks after valve replacement. LESSONS: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of EFE and emphasizes the importance of considering fungal endocarditis as a source of infection in immunosuppressed patients presenting with severe vitritis, even in the absence of systemic symptoms. Early recognition, prompt vitrectomy with intravitreal antifungal therapy, and thorough systemic evaluation are essential to improve visual and systemic outcomes."
15641397,Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis 10 years after return out of Africa in an immunocompetent host.,2004,"We report on a patient without immunologic dysfunction who developed a reactivation of a latent histoplasma infection, acquired during a previous stay in Africa more than 10 years before. The current reactivation resulted in a subacute progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. He developed progressive weight loss, prostration and different oropharyngeal lesions together with bilateral adrenal masses on CT scan. The diagnosis was made on histology of biopsies of the oropharyngeal lesions. All systemic symptoms normalised, the oropharyngeal lesions disappeared and the adrenal masses regressed under amphotericin B therapy followed by itraconazole consolidation therapy."
25641478,Prolonged antibiotic therapy increases risk of infection after transrectal prostate biopsy: a case report after pancreasectomy and review of the literature.,2014,Infection due to prostate biopsy afflicted more than 5% of patients and is the most common reason for hospitalization. A large series from US SEER-Medicare reported that men undergoing biopsy were 2.26 times more likely to be hospitalized for infectious complications within 30 days compared with randomly selected controls. The factors predicting a higher susceptibility to infection remain largely unknown but some authors have higlighted in the etiopathogenesis the importance of the augmented prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistant variant of bacteria in the rectum flora. We present one case of sepsis after transrectal prostate biopsy in a patient with history of pancreatic surgery. Based on our experience patients candidated to prostate biopsy with transrectal technique with history of recent major surgery represent an high risk category for infective complication. Also major pancreatic surgery should be consider an high risk category for infection. A transperineal approach and preventive measures (such as rectal swab) should be adopted to reduce biopsy driven infection.
25626932,Evaluation of urgent esophagectomy in esophageal perforation.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal trauma is considered one of the most severe lesions of the digestive tract. There is still much controversy in choosing the best treatment for cases of esophageal perforation since that decision involves many variables. The readiness of medical care, the patient's clinical status, the local conditions of the perforated segment, and the severity of the associated injuries must be considered for the most adequate therapeutic choice. AIM: To demonstrate and to analyze the results of urgent esophagectomy in a series of patients with esophageal perforation. METHODS: A retrospective study of 31 patients with confirmed esophageal perforation. Most injuries were due to endoscopic dilatation of benign esophageal disorders, which had evolved with stenosis. The diagnosis of perforation was based on clinical parameters, laboratory tests, and endoscopic images. ‪The main surgical technique used was transmediastinal esophagectomy followed by reconstruction of the digestive tract in a second surgical procedure. Patients were evaluated for the development of systemic and local complications, especially for the dehiscence or stricture of the anastomosis of the cervical esophagus with either the stomach or the transposed colon. RESULTS: Early postoperative evaluation showed a survival rate of 77.1% in relation to the proposed surgery, and 45% of these patients presented no further complications. The other patients had one or more complications, being pulmonary infection and anastomotic fistula the most frequent. The seven patients (22.9%) who underwent esophageal resection 48 hours after the diagnosis died of sepsis. At medium and long-term assessments, most patients reported a good quality of life and full satisfaction regarding the surgery outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the morbidity, emergency esophagectomy has its validity, especially in well indicated cases of esophageal perforation subsequent to endoscopic dilation for benign strictures."
25499901,Continuous tissue glucose monitoring correlates with measurement of intermittent capillary glucose in patients with distributive shock.,2015,"BACKGROUND: Intermittent glycemic measurements in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) can result in episodes of severe hypoglycemia or in a poor control of glycemia range. We designed a study to assess accuracy and reliability of continuous monitoring of tissue glucose for patients with distributive shock. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of distributive shock and the need of insulin infusion for glycemic control were included in the study. These patients were implanted a Continuous Glucose Control Monitoring System (CGMS) with the sensor inserted subcutaneously into the abdominal wall. CGMS values were recorded every 5min. Capillary glucose (CG) was monitored for adjusting insulin perfusion according to the ICU protocol. Correlation between both methods was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 11,673 CGMS and 348 CG values were recorded. In five patients, CGMS failed to detect tissue glucose. A glucose value <3.33mmol/l (<60mg/dl) was observed in 3.6% of CGMS and in 0.29% CG values. 295 pairs of measurements were included in the statistical analysis for correlation assessment. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.706. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.71 (p<0.0001, 95% CI 0.65-0.76). The mean of differences between both measurement methods was 0.22mmol/l (3.98mg/dl) (95% CI 0.66-7.31). CONCLUSIONS: When the Continuous Glucose Control Monitoring System (CGMS) is able to obtain data (75% of the patients), there is correlation between the values obtained by this method and capillary blood glucose in patients with distributive shock. CGMS can detect more episodes of glycemic excursions outside the normal range than intermittent capillary glucose monitoring. Variables that may impair glucose metabolism and peripheral soft tissues perfusion could impair CGMS measurements."
19968993,Investigations into human serum sensitivity expressed by stocks of Trypanosoma brucei evansi.,2010,"Trypanosoma brucei evansi, a widely distributed species of trypanosome infecting different livestock species in many countries in Africa, Asia and South America, has recently been reported as a pathogen causing a case of human trypanosomiasis in India. To date, there is little information regarding the natural resistance of animal-infective stocks of T. b. evansi to normal human serum (NHS). In this study, we investigated the degree of sensitivity to NHS of 15 stocks of T. b. evansi from different geographical origins and found that 10 of the stocks were completely susceptible to the action of NHS; parasites disappeared from the blood of infected mice within a few hours and the mice remained free from infection for more than 1 month. The remaining five stocks were partially resistant to NHS; although parasites initially disappeared from the circulation more than 50% of the mice showed relapse infection 10-18 days later. Studies on one stock, T. b. evansi STIB 810, showed that the changes in parasitaemia in the infected mice were correlated with the amount of NHS inoculated (correlation factor -0.584 and P=0.001). When this stock was passaged 25 times in mice in the presence of NHS it was found that the trypanosomes' serum resistance increased compared with the parent stock from which they were derived; 40% of the passaged parasites survived after in vitro incubation with 50% NHS for 7h, while only 1% of individual trypanosomes of the parent stock survived under the same conditions. These findings show, to our knowledge for the first time, that human serum sensitivity varies amongst stocks of T. b. evansi, that some of them naturally display resistance to NHS and that, furthermore, T. b. evansi serum resistance can be increased by sub-passage in the presence of NHS."
31938608,Giant Mucocele of the Remnant Esophagus: Case Report of a Rare Complication Following a Bipolar Esophageal Exclusion Procedure.,2019,"We describe a case of a symptomatic mucocele of the esophagus following surgical isolation of the diseased esophagus, which needed surgical resection. A 33-year-old male presented to us with shock, high-grade fever, and breathlessness five days after the onset of sudden, severe lower chest and upper abdominal pain preceded by an episode of retching and vomiting. He was initially managed elsewhere by right intercostal drainage for right-sided pleural effusion, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition. CT chest showed a right loculated pleural effusion and distal oesophageal perforation with active contrast leak into the right pleural space. He was subsequently referred to us in view of suspected Boerhaave's syndrome and clinical worsening. In view of hemodynamic instability with uncontrolled sepsis, he was planned for surgery. Intraoperatively, there was a 4 cm long distal oesophageal perforation, 4 cm above the esophagogastric junction on the right, with an unhealthy apex, communicating with a large abscess cavity in the right pleural space with thick purulent contents. End cervical esophagostomy with esophagogastric junction stapling and feeding jejunostomy was performed in addition to transhiatal drainage of the abscess at the lower end of the esophagus and the placement of an additional intercostal drain. The postoperative period was uneventful, and he was discharged. After two months, he was assessed for possible esophagectomy and gastric pullup. Dense adhesions at thoracoscopy precluded any esophageal delineation and dissection. Attempted transhiatal dissection of the esophagus was unsuccessful in view of cicatrization, and it was decided to forego esophagectomy and proceed with bypass alone by a retrosternal gastric pull-up and cervical esophagogastrostomy. He was discharged following an uneventful postoperative period of recovery. Three months later, the patient presented with complaints of pain in the chest for three weeks, associated with hiccups. He was diagnosed to have a mucocele of the remnant esophagus based on a CT scan. The esophageal mucocele was excised by a transthoracic approach and, he was relieved of the pressure symptoms. Following the esophageal exclusion procedure, a mucocele of the remnant esophagus can develop due to the accumulation of secretions leading to subsequent dilatation. Small mucoceles are usually asymptomatic and often go unnoticed. However, in rare cases, it may enlarge to cause compression symptoms such as respiratory distress, chest pain, cough, hiccups, and an inability to swallow. Cross-sectional imaging clinches the diagnosis, and definitive surgery consists of surgical resection by a transthoracic approach."

31852035,Prospective Analysis of Hemorrhagic Cystitis and BK Viremia in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: BK virus (BKV) infection has been shown to be related to hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). There are conflicting data regarding the association between BKV titers in plasma and clinical disease as well as the risk factors for BKV-related HC. Our aim is to study the risk factors and relationship with plasma BK viral load for development of HC in a prospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 59 patients who received allo-HSCT between 2014 and 2016 by quantitative BK virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Altona Diagnostics, Germany) from blood samples at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 after allo-HSCT. The patients were monitored for signs and symptoms of HC. RESULTS: HC was diagnosed in 22 patients (37%) at a mean of 100 days (range: 0-367 days). In multivariate analysis, the usage of cyclophosphamide (sub-distribution hazard ratio [sdHR]: 7.82, confidence interval [CI]: 1.375-39.645, p=0.02), reactivated CMV (sdHR: 6.105, CI: 1.614-23.094, p=0.008), and positive BKV viremia (sdHR: 2.15, CI: 1.456-22.065, p=0.01) significantly increased the risk of developing HC. Patients with higher viral loads at day 30 and day 60 were diagnosed with more severe HC (p<0.001). Median BK viral loads of >101.5 copies/mL at day 0 (sensitivity 0.727, specificity 0.875), >98.5 copies/mL at day 30 (sensitivity 0.909, specificity 0.875), and >90.0 copies/mL at day 60 (sensitivity 0.909, specificity 0.875) were indicative of HC. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that administration of cyclophosphamide, CMV reactivation, and BK virus positivity were associated with HC. Plasma BK virus PCR titers at days 0, 30, and 60 after transplant were sensitive tools for predicting clinically proven HC."
41448354,"One-year outcomes by index treatment in older patients with acute cholecystitis. Protocol of the international, prospective, observational GOLDENEYE study.",2025,"BACKGROUND: This research project is motivated by the increasing prevalence of gallstones and biliary tract diseases in patients of advanced age, while also recognizing that the comorbidity burden of this population may necessitate a tailored treatment approach. Acute cholecystitis can rapidly progress to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis and even death. Age per se has no bearing on the severity of acute cholecystitis, but the burden of comorbidity in older patients may lead to rapid disease progression. METHODS: The GOLDENEYE study is an international, multicenter, prospective, observational research project designed to compare the outcomes of different management strategies for acute cholecystitis in seniors. The primary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments-supportive care, percutaneous gallbladder drainage, early or delayed cholecystectomy, and EUS-guided gallbladder drainage-on one-year additional treatment modalities, hospital readmissions, and outpatient care. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and survival rates. The study implements propensity score matching analysis to account for the non-randomized allocation of treatment modalities. Patients >/= 70 years diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, as per the Tokyo guidelines, are included. Exclusion criteria include prior episodes of cholecystitis or pancreatitis, terminal illness, and concurrent diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile duct disease, or digestive malignancy. Data collection is performed with the REDCap platform for data entry and monitoring. DISCUSSION: The GOLDENEYE study aims to generate evidence-based insights that will significantly influence the management of acute cholecystitis in elderly patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare practices in this growing demographic population. CLINICALTRIALS: gov, NCT07006298."
31855707,Fluctuations of consciousness after stroke: Associations with the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and potential undetected delirium.,2020,"PURPOSE: To examine associations between fluctuating consciousness and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) assessments in stroke patients compared to non-neurological patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We linked all recorded CAM-ICU assessments with corresponding Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) measurements in patients with stroke or sepsis from a single-center ICU database. Fluctuating consciousness was defined by RASS variability using standard deviations (SD) over 24-h periods; regression analyses were performed to determine associations with RASS variability and CAM-ICU rating. RESULTS: We identified 16,509 paired daily summaries of CAM-ICU and RASS measurements in 546 stroke patients and 1586 sepsis patients. Stroke patients had higher odds of positive (OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.3-5.5) and ""unable to assess"" (UTA; OR 5.2, 95% CI 4.0-6.8) CAM-ICU ratings compared to sepsis patients, and CAM-ICU-positive and UTA assessment-days had higher RASS variability than CAM-ICU-negative assessment-days, especially in stroke patients. Based on model-implied associations of RASS variability (OR 2.0 per semi-IQR-difference in RASS-SD, 95% CI 1.7-2.2) and stroke diagnosis (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.7) with CAM-ICU-positive assessments, over one-third of probable delirium cases among stroke patients were potentially missed by the CAM-ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke delirium may frequently go undetected by the CAM-ICU, even in the setting of fluctuating consciousness."
25625057,Broadening of the red blood cell distribution width is associated with increased severity of illness in patients with sepsis.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a pro-inflammatory state caused by systemic infection. As sepsis progresses, multiple organ systems become affected with subsequent increase in mortality. Elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) has been seen with changes of other inflammatory markers and thus could potentially serve as a means of assessing sepsis severity. In this study, we examine the association of RDW with APACHE II score and in-hospital mortality. METERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving a cohort of patients with sepsis. The study period spanned 2 years with a cohort of 349 patients. Data were collected to determine if RDW is associated with APACHE II scores and in-hospital mortality in this cohort. RESULTS: RDW correlated weakly (r s = 0.27), but significantly (P < 0.0001) with APACHE II scores; coefficient of determination (r (2) = 0.09). The odds ratios for the association of RDW with APACHE II were calculated over the RDW range 12-20% at a dichotomized level of APACHE II, i.e., <15 and >/=15. At a RDW >/=16%, multivariate analysis including all potential confounders indicated that RDW was independently associated with an APACHE II score of >/=15. Similarly, mortality was associated with RDW >/=16%. CONCLUSION: A prognostic biomarker for sepsis in the form of a routine blood test may be of considerable clinical utility. The results of our study suggest that RDW may have value in differentiating between more severe and less severe cases of sepsis. Future studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings."
41488103,Diagnostic potential of extended inflammation parameters for sepsis identification: a retrospective case-control study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: An early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is critical for improving patient outcomes. Extended inflammation parameters (EIPs), derived from routine complete blood count (CBC) analysis, have emerged as promising biomarkers for inflammatory response. This study aimed to explore the diagnostic potential of a model combining several EIPs for identifying sepsis in a case-control setting. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center, case-control study was conducted at Tawam Hospital, AlAin, United Arab Emirates involving 157 participants; 53 patients with confirmed sepsis per Sepsis-3 criteria admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 104 control participants from outpatient clinics with no obvious evidence of infection. EIPs, including immature granulocyte count (IG#), neutrophil reactivity intensity (NEUT-RI), and reactive lymphocyte percentage per lymphocyte (RE-LYMP%/L), were retrieved from initial CBCs performed on a Sysmex XN-1000 analyzer. A three-parameter logarithmic model was developed, and its performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap iterations to estimate bias-corrected performance. RESULTS: The logarithmic model, i.e., log(IG# + 1) + log(NEUT-RI/100 + 1) + log(RE-LYMP%/L/50 + 1), combining IG#, NEUT-RI, and RE-LYMP%/L demonstrated high apparent discrimination for identifying sepsis, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.902-0.980), a sensitivity of 88.5% (95% CI: 77.0-95.8%), and a specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 84.2-96.0%). Bootstrap internal validation yielded an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.874-0.966), with minimal optimism (0.018), suggesting model stability within this dataset. CONCLUSION: A prediction model combining three different EIPs demonstrated high discrimination in a case-control setting, however this design of comparing ICU sepsis patients to healthy outpatient controls introduces severe spectrum bias characteristic of two-gate studies, which can inflate discrimination metrics significantly when compared with single-gate Emergency Department populations where diagnostic uncertainty is genuine. These results should be considered preliminary exploratory findings only. The extreme spectrum bias inherent to our case-control design means reported performance reflects statistical discrimination in an artificial scenario rather than real-world diagnostic accuracy, with expected ED performance substantially lower (estimated AUC 0.70-0.79). Rigorous prospective validation in consecutive ED patients with suspected infection, including head-to-head comparison with established biomarkers procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, is essential before any clinical consideration."
25829703,Severe Colonic Complications requiring Sub-Total Colectomy in Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis-A Retrospective Study of 8 Patients.,2015,"Colonic involvement in acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Diagnosis of colonic pathology complicating acute pancreatitis is difficult. The treatment of choice is resection of the affected segment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of aggressive surgical approach when colonic complication is suspected. Retrospectively, 8 patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and colonic complications (2006-2010) were reviewed. Eight patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis requiring colonic resection were evaluated. Presentation was varied, including rectal bleeding (2), clinical deterioration during severe pancreatitis (4), colonic contrast leak on CT scan (1) and large bowel obstruction (1). Typically, patients with severe acute pancreatitis had colonic pathology obscured and unrecognized initially because of the ongoing, fulminant inflammatory process. All eight patients underwent Sub-total colectomy & ileostomy for suspected imminent or overt ischemia/perforation, based on the outer aspect of the colon. There was one mortality due to severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. All other patients recovered well and later underwent closure of the stoma. Recognition of large bowel involvement may be difficult because of nonspecific symptoms or be masked by the systemic features of a critical illness. Clinicians should be aware that acute pancreatitis may erode or inflame the large bowel, resulting in lifethreatening colonic necrosis, bleeding or perforation. In our series of eight patients, we observed that mortality can be reduced by this aggressive surgical approach. We recommend a low threshold for colonic resection due to unreliable detection of ischemia or imminent perforation by outside inspection during surgery for acute necrotizing pancreatitis."
41420218,"Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological differences between early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis in preterm infants: a cross-sectional study in Vietnam.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Although neonatal sepsis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, few studies in Vietnam have compared the characteristics of early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical, laboratory, and microbiological characteristics of EOS and LOS in preterm neonates at a tertiary obstetric hospital in Vietnam. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 106 preterm infants with culture-confirmed sepsis admitted from August 2022 to May 2024. Clinical data, laboratory results and blood cultures were analyzed. Statistical tests and univariate logistic regression were used to explore differences between EOS and LOS. RESULTS: Of 106 neonates, 24 (22.6%) had EOS, and 82 (77.4%) had LOS. LOS predominated in extremely preterm, very low birth weight infants and was associated with more severe symptoms, including respiratory distress and abnormal heart rate. EOS cases were more likely to have birth weight >/= 1500 g and maternal conditions such as intrapartum fever, genital infections, contaminated amniotic fluid and prolonged amniotic fluid leakage (> 18 h). Laboratory analysis revealed higher levels of leukopenia, platelet and cerebrospinal fluid protein in EOS, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and blood protein in LOS. Gram-negative bacteria were predominant in both groups. Escherichia coli was most common in EOS (46%), whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in LOS (38%). CONCLUSION: EOS and LOS in preterm neonates exhibit distinct patterns in perinatal factors, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and microbiological profiles. Differentiating these two entities may aid in timely diagnosis and guide empirical treatment in settings with limited resources."
25542059,beta-Lactam pharmacokinetics during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy: A case-control study.,2015,"Most adult patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) require antibiotic therapy, however the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactams have not been well studied in these conditions. In this study, data from all patients receiving ECMO support and meropenem (MEM) or piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) were reviewed. Drug concentrations were measured 2h after the start of a 30-min infusion and just before the subsequent dose. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) results in ECMO patients were matched with those in non-ECMO patients for (i) drug regimen, (ii) renal function, (iii) total body weight, (iv) severity of organ dysfunction and (v) age. Drug concentrations were considered adequate if they remained 4-8x the clinical MIC breakpoint for Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 50% (TZP) or 40% (MEM) of the dosing interval. A total of 41 TDM results (27 MEM; 14 TZP) were obtained in 26 ECMO patients, with 41 matched controls. There were no significant differences in serum concentrations or pharmacokinetic parameters between ECMO and non-ECMO patients, including Vd [0.38 (0.27-0.68) vs. 0.46 (0.33-0.79)L/kg; P=0.37], half-life [2.6 (1.8-4.4) vs. 2.9 (1.7-3.7)h; P=0.96] and clearance [132 (66-200) vs. 141 (93-197)mL/min; P=0.52]. The proportion of insufficient (13/41 vs. 12/41), adequate (15/41 vs. 19/41) and excessive (13/41 vs. 10/41) drug concentrations was similar in ECMO and non-ECMO patients. Achievement of target concentrations of these beta-lactams was poor in ECMO and non-ECMO patients. The influence of ECMO on MEM and TZP pharmacokinetics does not appear to be significant."
41613378,"Case Report: Complete remission in a neonate with high-risk neuroblastoma harboring MYCN amplification and 1p deletion: a case for aggressive early intervention, and literature review.",2025,"Neuroblastoma is the most prevalent extracranial solid tumor in infancy and early childhood, accounting for 8%-10% of all pediatric malignancies and contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality. Its clinical spectrum ranges from spontaneous regression to aggressive metastatic disease, often influenced by underlying genetic aberrations such as MYCN amplification and chromosomal deletions (1p, 11q, and 17q). We present a rare case of a full-term male neonate diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma originating from the left adrenal gland, exhibiting both MYCN amplification and 1p deletion. The patient had extensive liver metastases and supradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy at diagnosis. Multimodal treatment, including intensive chemotherapy per the NB2004 protocol, surgical resection, high-dose consolidation chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), led to complete remission by 11 months of age. Despite severe post-transplant complications such as sepsis and enteropathy, the patient remained disease-free with normal developmental milestones at follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neonatal neuroblastoma with concurrent MYCN amplification and 1p deletion achieving favorable outcome through comprehensive multimodal therapy. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, genetic profiling, and aggressive treatment in managing high-risk neuroblastoma in neonates."
32335654,Biofilm Formation and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producer among Acinetobacter Species Isolated in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter species are short, stout, gram-negative coccobacilli, generally considered to be a relatively low-grade pathogen. However, its resistance towards multiple classes of antibiotics through an array of resistance mechanisms including its ability to form biofilm has led to its emergence as an important pathogen in hospital settings. This study was done to determine the prevalence of biofilm former and Extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamase producer among Acinetobacter species. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was done in the clinical microbiology laboratory, Kathmandu Medical College from January to June 2019. Convenient sampling method was used. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee, Ref no. 2812201805. Preliminary identification followed by characterization of Acinetobacter species was done. Antibiotic susceptibility test was done using the Kirby-Bauer method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamase was detected by combined disc method and Biofilm detection was done using congo red agar method. Statistical Package for Social Sciences 16.0 version statistical software package was used for statistical analysis. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequencyand proportion for binarydata. RESULTS: Among 108 Acinetobacter species, 86 (79.7%) Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex was seen. Seventy-eight (72%) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant, 34 (31%) of the isolates were Extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamase producer and only 10 (9.3%) of the isolates, were biofilm producers. CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. with the ability to produce Extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamase is prevalent in our hospital settings. Strict compliance with infection control practices is necessary to curb its spread."
25834520,Lassa fever - full recovery without ribavarin treatment: a case report.,2014,"BACKGROUND: Lassa fever is a rodent-borne zoonosis that clinically manifests as an acute hemorrhagic fever. It is treated using ribavarin. Surviving Lassa fever without receiving the antiviral drug ribavarin is rare. Only few cases have been documented to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 59-year old female with fever who was initially thought to have acute pyelonephritis and sepsis syndrome with background malaria. Further changes in her clinical state and laboratory tests led to a suspicion of Lassa fever. However at the time her laboratory confirmatory test for Lassa fever returned, her clinical state had improved and she made full recovery without receiving ribavarin. Her close contacts showed no evidence of Lassa virus infection. CONCLUSION: This report adds to the literature on the natural history of Lassa fever; and that individuals may survive Lassa fever with conservative management of symptoms of the disease and its complications."
18521398,A Phase II Study of Docetaxel for the Treatment of Recurrent Osteosarcoma.,2004,"PURPOSE: To determine the response and toxicity of docetaxel in recurrent osteosarcoma and related spindle cell tumours of bone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients, 10 males and four females, were enrolled, median age 30.5 years (range, 17-46). Diagnosis was: conventional osteosarcoma, 12 patients; periosteal osteosarcoma, one patient; and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone, one patient. Initial chemotherapy had been with doxorubicin and cisplatin in 10 patients, and multiagent regimens in four. Nine had been treated with second line chemotherapy before receiving docetaxel. Thirteen patients had lung metastases and one intra-abdominal disease. Docetaxel 100 mg/malpha(2) was given as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks. Response was assessed every two cycles to a maximum of six. RESULTS: A total of 43 cycles were given, median of two per patient (range 1-6). Thirteen patients were evaluable for response. A single partial remission was seen, for a response rate of 8%. Two patients had stable disease, and one patient a mixed response. Forty cycles were evaluable for toxicity. The principle toxicity was haematological, with a median neutrophil count of 0.9 (range 0-9.6). There were four episodes of neutropenic sepsis (10%). The only non-haematological toxicity >/=grade 3 was stomatitis, occurring in just one patient. There were no toxic deaths. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel at this dose and schedule is well tolerated, but is not associated with significant activity in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma."
41578749,Clinical Analysis of Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder After Liver Transplant.,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a severe and potentially fatal complication after liver transplant, resulting from immunosuppression-driven uncontrolled lymphoid proliferation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the incidence, clinico-pathological characteristics, management, and outco-mes of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in liver transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1288 patients who underwent liver transplant between January 2015 and December 2024. Among them, 8 recipients (0.62%) were diagnosed with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder based on histopathological and clinical criteria. Baseline characteristics, clinicopathological characteristics, management, and outcome data were collected and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Age at time of transplant was 55.5 years (range, 44-62 years), and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was diagnosed at 10.5 months posttransplant (interquartile range, 7.5-28.5 mo; range, 5-44 mo). Clinical manifestations were diverse and nonspecific, with 6 having allograft involvement (75%) and 7 having detectable Epstein-Barr virus positivity (87.5%). Monomorphic B-cell posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (B-cell lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) was the most common subtype (87.5%). All recipients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder received immunosuppression reduction or withdrawal. Three patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-type received chemotherapy, 1 with central nervous system-type received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, and 1 received rituximab combined with radiofrequency ablation for liver lesions. Of the 8 recipients, 3 had remission and 5 died due to sepsis complications and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Median time from diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder to death was 2 months (range, 1.5-5.5 mo). CONCLUSIONS: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disor-der, characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, remains a serious complication after liver transplant. Early diagnosis requires a combination of Epstein-Barr virus DNA monitoring and imaging. Definitive patho-logical diagnosis and classification are essential for guiding treatment strategies, including reduction of immunosuppression and rituximab-based chemotherapy."
25520442,Proposing an empirically justified reference threshold for blood culture sampling rates in intensive care units.,2015,"Early and appropriate blood culture sampling is recommended as a standard of care for patients with suspected bloodstream infections (BSI) but is rarely taken into account when quality indicators for BSI are evaluated. To date, sampling of about 100 to 200 blood culture sets per 1,000 patient-days is recommended as the target range for blood culture rates. However, the empirical basis of this recommendation is not clear. The aim of the current study was to analyze the association between blood culture rates and observed BSI rates and to derive a reference threshold for blood culture rates in intensive care units (ICUs). This study is based on data from 223 ICUs taking part in the German hospital infection surveillance system. We applied locally weighted regression and segmented Poisson regression to assess the association between blood culture rates and BSI rates. Below 80 to 90 blood culture sets per 1,000 patient-days, observed BSI rates increased with increasing blood culture rates, while there was no further increase above this threshold. Segmented Poisson regression located the threshold at 87 (95% confidence interval, 54 to 120) blood culture sets per 1,000 patient-days. Only one-third of the investigated ICUs displayed blood culture rates above this threshold. We provided empirical justification for a blood culture target threshold in ICUs. In the majority of the studied ICUs, blood culture sampling rates were below this threshold. This suggests that a substantial fraction of BSI cases might remain undetected; reporting observed BSI rates as a quality indicator without sufficiently high blood culture rates might be misleading."
20017415,[Acute renal failure in premature neonates].,2009,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Hemodynamic stress is the leading cause of acute renal failure (ARF) in premature neonates. Incidence of ARF in this population is between 8 and 24%. The aim of this study was to determine the frequence of presence of ARF in premature neonates, as well as its impact on their survival. METHODS: A retrospective study of 114 premature neonates [(gestational age, GA less than 37 gestation weeks (gw)] admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Pediatric Clinic, Institute of Child and Youth Healthcare of Vojvodina in 2007 was conducted. Serum creatinine, urea and bilirubine were determined on the 3rd day of life in 65 newborns who met inclusion criteria. ARF was diagnosed in 16 newborns (n = 16/65; 25%). RESULTS: The premature neonates with ARF had significantly lower GA [<28 gw - 8/16 (50%) vs. 5/49 (10%); p < 0.05], birth weight (BW) (1265 g vs. 1615 g; p < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (43.37 mm Hg vs. 52.7 mmHg; p < 0.05) than ones without ARF. Non-olyguric ARF was diagnosed in 62% of newborns with ARF (n = 10/16), while the rest had the olyguric type (n = 6/16; 38%). Twenty-five percent of premature neonates with ARF (n = 4/16) died in contrast to 10% of premature neonates without ARF (n = 5/49). ARF was treated conservatively in all but 3 cases when peritoneal dialysis was performed. Renal function has recovered completely in all of the survivors. In order to determine their predictivity in relation to ARF, following parameters were analyzed: GA, BW < 1500 g, presence of concomitant sepsis and intracranial hemorrhage grade III/IV. BW < 1500 g demonstrated the highest sensitivity (se 0.75), while GA < 28 gw, sepsis and intracranial hemorrhage grade III/IV showed high specificity (sp = 0.90, 0.89 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSION: Acute renal failure frequently occurs in population of premature neonates and requires meticulous fluid and electrolyte balance, especially in the case of low birth weight and extreme immaturity."
15744129,Sepsis-induced changes in macrophage co-stimulatory molecule expression: CD86 as a regulator of anti-inflammatory IL-10 response.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a substantial risk after surgery or other trauma. Macrophage dysfunction, as a component of immune suppression seen during trauma and sepsis, appears to be one of the contributing factors to morbidity and mortality. However, whereas it is known that the ability of macrophages to present antigen and express major histocompatibility complex MHC class II molecules is decreased during sepsis, it is not known to what extent this is associated with the loss of co-stimulatory receptor expression. Our objectives in this study were, therefore, to determine if the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD40, CD80, or CD86, on peritoneal/splenic/liver macrophages were altered by sepsis (cecal ligation [CL] and puncture [CLP] or necrotic tissue injury (CL) alone; and to establish the contribution of such changes to the response to septic challenge using mice that are deficient in these receptors. METHODS: To address our first objective, male C3H/HeN mice were subjected to CLP, CL, or sham (n = four to six mice/group), and the adherent macrophages were isolated from the peritoneum, spleen, or liver at 24 h post-insult. The macrophages were then analyzed by flow cytometry for their ex vivo expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, and/or MHC II. RESULTS: The expression of CD86 and MHC II, but not CD40 or CD80, were significantly decreased on peritoneal macrophages after the onset of sepsis or CL alone. In addition, CD40 expression was significantly increased in Kupffer cells after sepsis. Alternatively, splenic macrophages from septic or CL mice did not show changes in the expression of CD80, CD86, or CD40. To the degree that the loss of CD86 expression might contribute to the changes reported in macrophage function in septic mice, we subsequently examined the effects of CLP on CD86 -/- mice. Interestingly, we found that, unlike the background controls, neither the serum IL-10 concentrations nor the IL-10 release capacity of peritoneal macrophages from septic CD86 -/- mice were increased. CONCLUSION: Together, these data suggest a potential role for the co-stimulatory receptor CD86/B7-2 beyond that of simply promoting competent antigen presentation to T-cells, but also as a regulator of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 response. Such a role may implicate the latter response in the development of sepsis-induced immune dysfunction."
15601815,Frequency of infective endocarditis among infants and children with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.,2005,"PURPOSE: The prevalence of infective endocarditis (IE) among children with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine prospectively the prevalence of IE among pediatric patients with SAB in a large tertiary care center. METHODS: Between July 1998 and June 2001, all children who developed SAB whose parent/guardian signed informed consent underwent echocardiography. Clinical and follow-up results were collected prospectively. Endocarditis was classified according to the modified Duke criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-one children developed SAB during the study interval. Definite (6 patients [11.8%]) or possible (4 patients [7.8%]) IE was present in 10 of 51 (20%) children with SAB. Most children (73%) developed bacteremia as a consequence of an infected intravascular device. Children with underlying congenital heart disease had a significantly higher prevalence of definite or possible IE, compared with those with structurally normal hearts (53% vs 3%). All patients with definite IE had multiple positive blood cultures. Mortality was high among patients with and without IE (40% vs 12%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the prevalence of definite IE among children with SAB was approximately 12% and was frequently associated with congenital heart disease and multiple positive blood cultures. The mortality for children with SAB and definite or possible S aureus IE is high."
19996327,Intrapartum antibiotics and risk factors for early onset sepsis.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the independent risk factors for early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) in a setting where the policy is to use intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for known risk factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Level III neonatal unit in a developing country. PATIENTS: Consecutive mother-infant dyads (gestation < or =34 weeks) with no major neonatal malformations. INTERVENTIONS: Thirteen putative maternal and neonatal risk factors and use of IAP were assessed. Neonates were followed until 72 h of life for signs of EONS. Blood cultures were drawn on clinical suspicion of EONS and/or prior to starting prophylactic antibiotics for high risk asymptomatic neonates. MAIN OUTCOME: Culture-proven EONS (onset at <72 h). RESULTS: 601 mother-infant dyads were enrolled (mean (SD) gestation=31.8 (2) weeks; mean (SD) birth weight 1559.4 (452) g). The best fitted multivariable logistic regression model had six independent risk factors (adjusted OR (95% CI)): vaginal examinations > or =3 (9.5 (3 to 31)), clinical chorioamnionitis (8.8 (2 to 43)), birth weight <1500 g (2.8 (2 to 5)), male sex (2.7 (2 to 5)), gestation <30 weeks (2 (1 to 4)) and no IAP (2 (1.04 to 4)). Regression coefficients were converted into scores of 6, 6, 3, 3, 2 and 2, respectively. Internal prediction accuracy was 86.5% and c statistic was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal examinations > or =3, clinical chorioamnionitis, birth weight <1500 g, male sex, gestation <30 weeks and no intrapartum antibiotics were independent risk factors for EONS among preterm infants of < or =34 weeks' gestation."
41676801,Fatal Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Presenting as Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus Syndrome with Gastrointestinal Perforation: An Autopsy Case Report.,2026,"We report a rare and fatal case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) initially presenting as medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) syndrome. A 64-year-old man with a history of duodenal ulcer and hypertension presented with diplopia. Neurological examination revealed impaired adduction of the left eye with preserved convergence, consistent with MLF syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple high-intensity lesions, including one in the left dorsal pons. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated PR3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody level of 205 IU/mL. A kidney biopsy on day 18 revealed crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis, confirming the diagnosis of GPA. Corticosteroid pulse therapy was initiated, but gastrointestinal perforation occurred on day 26, requiring extensive gastrectomy. Pathology revealed ulcerative changes and neutrophil infiltration, but no vasculitic lesions. Because of hepatic dysfunction from hepatitis C virus infection, escalation of immunosuppressive therapy was not feasible. On day 111, the patient developed a second gastrointestinal perforation, leading to sepsis and death on day 136. Autopsy revealed duodenal perforation and multiple cerebral infarctions corresponding to prior magnetic resonance imaging findings. No definitive vasculitic lesions were identified. This case highlights an unusual central nervous system onset of GPA as MLF syndrome. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis should be considered even in patients with atypical neurological manifestations, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential."
41412939,Novel association between true surgical pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforations in a newborn and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,2025,"A late preterm male baby with antenatally diagnosed left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) was delivered electively at 36 weeks of gestation. He remained stable until day 2 of life, when he developed severe persistent pulmonary hypertension secondary to sepsis, including persistent Candida sepsis, delaying CDH repair. On day 13, he developed sudden abdominal distension, and radiography confirmed pneumoperitoneum without pneumothorax. Primary peritoneal drainage released a gush of air, following which exploratory surgery was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed two separate small bowel perforations that were resected and anastomosed along with CDH repair. This case highlights one of the first reported instances of true surgical pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforations in a neonate with CDH, unlike previously described cases where pneumoperitoneum was attributed to pulmonary air leaks or gastric perforation."
41407463,[The clinical study of azacitidine and lenalidomide combination in myelodysplastic neoplasm patients with TP53 mutations].,2025,"Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of azacitidine combined with lenalidomide in MDS patients and explore potential mechanisms of therapeutic response. Methods: Sixteen MDS patients with TP53 mutations received azacitidine plus lenalidomide at ZhongDa Hospital, Southeast University (January 2021-June 2025). Efficacy and safety were assessed, and TP53 mutation status was correlated with treatment response. Whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics were used to explore molecular biomarkers associated with therapeutic efficacy. Results: Sixteen patients (median age 69.5 years, range 52-82; 8 males, 8 females) were enrolled. According to the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M), 1, 2, and 13 patients were classified as median low, high, and very high risk, respectively. Among 16 TP53-mutated patients, 11 had biallelic mutations and 5 had monoallelic mutations. Overall response rate was 56.3% (9/16), composite complete remission rate (CRc) was 31.3% (5/16), and hematology improvement rate was 25% (4/16). Among TP53-mutated patients, the response rate was 56.3% (9/16), with variant allele frequency dropping from 65.6% to 16.5% in responders (P=0.017). In patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotype, response rate was 53.8% (7/13), with 57.1% (4/7) showing disappearance of CK post-treatment. The most common grade 3-4 nonhematologic adverse events were infections (9/16, 56.3% ), including pneumonia (4/16, 25.0% ), gastrointestinal infections (3/16, 18.8% ), perianal infections (1/16, 6.3% ) and sepsis (1/16, 6.3% ). High CBX8 expression may be linked to treatment response. Conclusion: Azacitidine plus lenalidomide is an effective and safe therapy for MDS, including patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotypes. Treatment markedly reduces TP53 variant allele frequency in responders, and high CBX8 expression may predict therapeutic response."
41626985,Optimal large language models to screen citations for systematic reviews.,2025,"Recent studies highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) in citation screening for systematic reviews; however, the efficiency of individual LLMs for this application remains unclear. This study aimed to compare accuracy, time-related efficiency, cost, and consistency across four LLMs-GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.3 70B-for literature screening tasks. The models screened for clinical questions from the Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2024. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each model based on conventional citation screening results for qualitative assessment. We also recorded the time and cost of screening and assessed consistency to verify reproducibility. A post hoc analysis explored whether integrating outputs from multiple models could enhance screening accuracy. GPT-4o and Llama 3.3 70B achieved high specificity but lower sensitivity, while Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited higher sensitivity at the cost of lower specificity. Citation screening times and costs varied, with GPT-4o being the fastest and Llama 3.3 70B the most cost-effective. Consistency was comparable among the models. An ensemble approach combining model outputs improved sensitivity but increased the number of false positives, requiring additional review effort. Each model demonstrated distinct strengths, effectively streamlining citation screening by saving time and reducing workload. However, reviewing false positives remains a challenge. Combining models may enhance sensitivity, indicating the potential of LLMs to optimize systematic review workflows."
25588861,Change of hemopexin level is associated with the severity of sepsis in endotoxemic rat model and the outcome of septic patients.,2015,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to uncover the role of hemopexin (HPX) as anti-inflammatory mediator in animals and humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We injected rats with 5 and 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide to induce low- and high-grade endotoxemia (LGE and HGE), respectively, and we measured serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and HPX at 0, 1, 3, and 6 hours after the injection. In a clinical study, we measured the initial serum HPX concentrations of septic shock patients. We evaluated the correlation between HPX levels and sepsis severity in rats and the predictive value of the HPX level for 28-day mortality of patients. RESULTS: In rats, serum interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations were lower in LGE than in HGE, whereas the HPX level in HGE at 6 hours was significantly lower than in LGE (0.88, interquartile range [0.79-1.00] vs 1.33, interquartile range [1.29-1.49] mg/mL, P= .002). In patients, the initial serum HPX level in nonsurvivors was significantly lower than in survivors (0.75 vs 1.02 mg/mL, P< .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HPX exhibited independent prognostic value for 28-day mortality, and its levels were closely related to Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum HPX levels are related to sepsis severity and could indicate poor prognosis for septic shock patients."
16596561,Incidence of sepsis in central venous catheter-bearing patients with hematologic malignancies: preliminary results.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential devices in the management of patients with hematological disorders treated with chemotherapy. However, their nature predisposes patients to unwanted complications. METHODS: CVC-related complications were retrospectively analyzed in 227 hematologic patients who were consecutively admitted to our hematology department between May 2002 and April 2004. Patients' diagnoses comprised acute myeloid leukemia (36.8%), acute lymphoid leukemia (7.3%), lymphoproliferative disorders (28.3%), multiple myeloma (19.5%), myeloproliferative syndromes (5%) and others (3.1%). The CVCs used were polyurethane three lumen 7-Fr (111 patients) for chemotherapy and 12-Fr (114 patients) for chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell apheresis, plus two tunneled catheters. RESULTS: The pathological events were: bacteriaemias (n=46); occlusions (n=10); exit tunnel infections (n=8); thrombosis (n=6); lung emboli (n=2). Among febrile patients the bacteriemia frequency was 20%, of which 13.6% were CVC-related (with a higher incidence in leukemia patients (p=0.027). Among the isolates, gram-positive bacteria were found in 29 cases (23 CVC-related cases), and gram-negative bacteria in 16 cases (8 CVC-related cases). Only one patient had Candida albicans sepsis. At univariate and multivariate analysis significant risk factors for infection (p<0.0001) were only the number of days/catheters and neutropenia duration. CONCLUSIONS: In our hematologic patients, the CVC complications were mainly septic, with only 10.1% of CVC-related bacteriemias, despite prolonged catheterization duration. Acute leukemia patients were at major risk for sepsis, probably due to a more severe neutropenia and prolonged catheterization duration."
41531628,"Sequential Folliculitis, Paraspinal Myositis, and Septic Arthritis Due to Hematogenous Staphylococcus aureus Infection in a Patient Receiving Adalimumab Therapy.",2025,"Skin infections are a well-recognized source of bacteremia and can serve as foci for hematogenous spread leading to sepsis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. Immunosuppressive therapies, particularly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors such as adalimumab, predispose patients to severe infections and are associated with increased infectious morbidity and mortality. These agents impair innate immune signaling and may attenuate the clinical manifestations of infection. Specifically, TNF-alpha blockade disrupts downstream interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathways that mediate leukocyte recruitment and the febrile response. Consequently, patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors may present with bacteremia or early sepsis in the absence of typical findings such as fever or leukocytosis, potentially delaying diagnosis and treatment. We report a middle-aged Caucasian male patient receiving adalimumab therapy who initially presented to the emergency department with presumed paraspinal muscle strain and degenerative spondylosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was interpreted as consistent with muscular strain and degenerative spondylosis. Subsequent orthopedic evaluation revealed a septic-appearing left knee, with synovial and blood cultures positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Further review of his history revealed that he had been treated for folliculitis over the occipital scalp one week prior to presentation, suggesting hematogenous dissemination from a cutaneous source. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and atypical presentation, we conclude that bacteremia secondary to folliculitis resulted in occult paraspinal myositis mimicking a muscle strain, and ultimately progressed to septic arthritis. This case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion for hematogenous infection in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors who present with musculoskeletal pain and minimal systemic findings."
15599571,A mycotic aneurysm of the ascending aorta and aortic arch induced by Salmonella Enteritidis.,2004,"In very rare cases, salmonella infection may be associated with extra-intestinal manifestations. Of these, a mycotic aneurysm represents a life-threatening complication that is characterised by a high mortality rate. Prompt treatment with a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention is urgently required. We report on the case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with salmonella bacteraemia and the rare complication of an infected aneurysm of the ascending aorta and aortic arch."
20187479,[Temporary total fecal diversion--ultimate solution for complex recurrent anal fistula].,2009,"Anal fistula is a frequent disease, but complex fistulae are relatively uncommon. The treatment for this pathology remains debated all over the world, and in cases of complex fistulae represents a challenge. We present a 55 years old male, operated more than 40 times in the last 15 years for perianal recurrent fistulas and abscesses. The fistula has had a progressive evolution despite all kind of surgery and has extended finally to entire perineal and gluteal region; more than 30 orifices were founded on skin surface and many internal anorectal orifices as well. The patient is weakened, anemic, in chronic sepsis. As a last resort, we decided to perform a terminal fecal diverting stoma at the level of sigmoid colon, with closure of distal end. There were subsequent operations necessary to resolve perineal and gluteal disease: extensive excisions of altered tissues, various full-thickness skin grafts and covering flaps. After 12 months the perineal region was clean, so remaking of colic continuity was possible. Continuous follow-up until 12 months revealed no sign of recurrence. We conclude that temporary total fecal diversion followed by wide excisions of perianal fistulous tissues represents an ultimate solution to complex recurrent perianal fistula, with good results at least in our case."
19941004,Local and remote tissue injury upon intestinal ischemia and reperfusion depends on the TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway.,2010,"Innate immune responses against microorganisms may be mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (i-I/R) leads to the translocation of bacteria and/or bacterial products such as endotoxin, which activate TLRs leading to acute intestinal and lung injury and inflammation observed upon gut trauma. Here, we investigated the role of TLR activation by using mice deficient for the common TLR adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) on local and remote inflammation following intestinal ischemia. Balb/c and MyD88(-/-) mice were subjected to occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (45 min) followed by intestinal reperfusion (4 h). Acute neutrophil recruitment into the intestinal wall and the lung was significantly diminished in MyD88(-/-) after i-I/R, which was confirmed microscopically. Diminished neutrophil recruitment was accompanied with reduced concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta level. Furthermore, diminished microvascular leak and bacteremia were associated with enhanced survival of MyD88(-/-) mice. However, neither TNF-alpha nor IL-1beta neutralization prevented neutrophil recruitment into the lung but attenuated intestinal inflammation upon i-I/R. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that disruption of the TLR/MyD88 pathway in mice attenuates acute intestinal and lung injury, inflammation, and endothelial damage allowing enhanced survival."

He had grade IV oral mucositis, and received Saccharomyces boulardii (Perenterol) orally as treatment for aseptic diarrhoea just before the onset of fungemia. We discuss the epidemiology and pathology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the cancer patient population."
41624837,Multi-omics machine learning identifies diagnostic gene signatures and functionally supports PRKACB involvement in macrophage inflammatory responses in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response, often leading to organ failure and death. Diagnosis and therapy remain challenging. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for sepsis through multi-omics analysis and experimental validation. A total of 1,166 samples from the GEO repository underwent differential analysis, WGCNA, and logistic regression to identify sepsis-associated features. After SVM-RFE screening, a 28-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from healthy controls achieved an AUC of 0.970 (sensitivity 0.939, specificity 1.000) in an independent cohort and 0.870 (sensitivity 0.906, specificity 0.700) in qRT-PCR validation. A 13-gene signature distinguishing sepsis from SIRS achieved an AUC of 1.000 (sensitivity 1.000, specificity 1.000) and 0.745 (sensitivity 0.500, specificity 0.900), respectively. PRKACB, consistently decreased in sepsis, emerged as a myeloid-associated hub gene with functional support in macrophages. Single-cell analysis revealed that PRKACB is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, with macrophages and neutrophils showing the most notable compositional changes. Pathway enrichment indicated distinct PRKACB-related functions between sepsis and healthy controls, and across myeloid subtypes. Reducing PRKACB expression significantly upregulated TNF-alpha and IL-1beta release and decreased THP-1 macrophage viability, suggesting that excessive inflammation may trigger apoptosis or metabolic dysfunction. These data support PRKACB as a myeloid hub linked to macrophage inflammatory output and viability, while defining the precise downstream signaling as a priority for future studies."
31866281,"Acalabrutinib monotherapy in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study.",2020,"BACKGROUND: Chemoimmunotherapy is typically the standard of care for patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia; however, infectious and hematologic toxic effects are problematic. Acalabrutinib is a selective, potent Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the activity and safety of acalabrutinib in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. METHODS: This single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 19 European academic centres in France, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, and the UK, and eight academic centres in the USA. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had treatment naive (declined or not eligible for chemoimmunotherapy) or relapsed or refractory (at least one previous therapy) Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that required treatment, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and received no previous Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients received 100 mg oral acalabrutinib twice per day in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response (at least a minor response) according to the 6th International Workshop for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) and the modified 3rd IWWM workshop criteria. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02180724, and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2014, and Dec 24, 2015, 122 patients were assessed for eligibility, of which 106 (87%) patients were given acalabrutinib (14 were treatment naive and 92 had relapsed or refractory disease). With a median follow-up of 27.4 months (IQR 26.0-29.7), 13 (93% [95% CI 66-100]) of 14 treatment naive patients achieved an overall response and 86 (93% [86-98]) of 92 relapsed or refractory patients per both the modified 3rd and 6th IWWM criteria. Seven (50%) of 14 treatment naive patients and 23 (25%) of 92 relapsed or refractory patients discontinued treatment on study. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients were neutropenia (17 [16%] of 106 patients) and pneumonia (7 [7%]). Grade 3-4 atrial fibrillation occurred in one (1%) patient and grade 3-4 bleeding occurred in three (3%) patients. The most common serious adverse events were lower respiratory tract infection (n=7 [7%]), pneumonia (n=7 [7%]), pyrexia (n=4 [4%]), cellulitis (n=3 [3%]), fall (n=3 [3%]), and sepsis (n=3 [3%]). Pneumonia (n=5 [5%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (n=4 [4%]) were considered treatment related. One treatment-related death was reported (intracranial hematoma). INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that acalabrutinib is active as single-agent therapy with a manageable safety profile in patients with treatment-naive, or relapse or refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Further studies are needed to establish its efficacy against current standard treatments and to investigate whether outcomes can be improved with combination therapies. FUNDING: Acerta Pharma."
41404282,Immune subphenotypes of tuberculosis and mortality in adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis causes high mortality among people living with HIV in Africa, yet immune response data are limited. We identified immune subphenotypes of adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa. METHODS: We determined the association of serum cytokine and antibody concentrations with CD4+ T-cell and blood lactate concentration, tuberculosis, and 30-day mortality with K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and logistic regression. We validated results in a separate cohort of adults with sepsis in East Africa. RESULTS: Of 208 participants in the discovery cohort, 117 (56%) were female and 175 (84%) were living with HIV, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 35 (+/-10) years. Participants with tuberculosis had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1MCAF, whereas mortality was associated with higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP-1beta, and lower concentrations of IgM antibodies against oxidation-specific epidopes (IgM (OSE) ). PCA identified G-CSF, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 as the main contributors to tuberculosis, and IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-13 as the main contributors to mortality. Comprehensive biomarker and clinical and multivariable models accurately predicted tuberculosis (AUC = 0.84) and mortality (AUC = 0.78), which was replicated in the validation cohort. Cross-testing showed that the tuberculosis model delineated pathogen-specific immune activation, while the mortality model represented non-pathogen-specific immune dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with sepsis and high HIV prevalence in East Africa, tuberculosis was associated with pathogen-specific inflammation, and mortality was associated with broader immune dysregulation and diminished IgM (OSE) antibody responses."
20677488,Ruptured tuboovarian abscess and septic shock with Clostridium perfringens in a postmenopausal woman: a case report.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium perfringens is the most common causative organism of gas gangrene, a necrotizing infection of soft tissue classically associated with traumatic injuries. Recently, awareness of its occurrence in spontaneous nontraumatic contexts has been increasing. The authors report an unusual case of nontraumatic/spontaneous C perfringens gas gangrene localized to the adnexae. CASE: A 55-year-old woman presented with abdominal complaints and had surgery because the computed tomographic finding of air in the abdomen led to a preoperative diagnosis of perforated bowel. An infected, draining, right tuboovarian complex and infected left tube were removed. The patient had a stormy postoperative course and was ultimately diagnosed with C perfringens infection/sepsis; she had to be readmitted over a month after discharge for drainage of a pelvic abscess, also due to clostridial infection. The patient ultimately underwent hysterectomy with removal of remaining adnexa. The hysterectomy specimen revealed endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSION: C perfringens can cause adnexal infection in the absence of trauma. Diagnosis may be difficult. Timely, aggressive surgical and medical therapy is imperative. When such cases occur, malignancy should be suspected."
31887150,An exclusive human milk diet for very low birth weight newborns-A cost-effectiveness and EVPI study for Germany.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: Human milk-based fortifiers have shown a protective effect on major complications for very low birth weight newborns. The current study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) compared to the current approach using cow's milk-based fortifiers in very low birth weight newborns. METHODS: A decision tree model using the health states of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, NEC + sepsis and no complication was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of an EHMD. For each health state, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (RoP) and neurodevelopmental problems were included as possible complications; additionally, short-bowel syndrome (SBS) was included as a complication for surgical treatment of NEC. The model was stratified into birth weight categories. Costs for inpatient treatment and long-term consequences were considered from a third party payer perspective for the reference year 2017. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, including a societal perspective, discounting rate and all input parameter-values. RESULTS: In the base case, the EHMD was estimated to be cost-effective compared to the current nutrition for very low birth weight newborns with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro28,325 per Life-Year-Gained (LYG). From a societal perspective, the ICER is euro27,494/LYG using a friction cost approach and euro16,112/LYG using a human capital approach. Deterministic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the estimate was robust against changes in the input parameters and probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the probability EHMD was cost-effective at a threshold of euro45,790/LYG was 94.8 percent. CONCLUSION: Adopting EHMD as the standard approach to nutrition is a cost-effective intervention for very low birth weight newborns in Germany."
15713993,Gemcitabine combined with oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer refractory or resistant to platinum and taxane.,2004,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter feasibility study was to determine the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of the gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin combination as second-line treatment in platinum plus paclitaxel resistant/refractory advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: Twenty patients received a 30-60-min infusion of gemcitabine a week for 2 weeks, followed by 120-180 min infusion of oxaliplatin every 3 weeks. The doses used were 1,000 and 130 mg/m(2), respectively. Seventeen cases (85% of the total) were platinum resistant and 3 (15%) were platinum refractory. RESULTS: Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 14/20 of cases (70%); there were no symptomatic cases. 2 patients required platelet transfusion and 8 patients received hydrocortisone. The dose- limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. Combined grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 8/20 (40%) of cases (no sepsis was registered). Five patients were treated with recombinant erythropoietin because of grade 3 anemia and 4 cases received G-CSF prophylactically from the first cycle. The overall response rate of the combination in terms of antitumor activity was 26% (95% CI = 9-51%). CONCLUSION: A combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin using this schedule gave rise to a moderate/severe toxicity profile and would be feasible only if growth factors were used and/or gemcitabine were administered at lower doses. The antitumor activity of the combination was insufficient reward for the resultant toxicity profile. However, equivalent to that of other drugs used in platinum refractory and resistant patients."
41607607,Molecular Diagnosis in Culture-Negative Meningococcal Arthritis: A Case Report and Case-Based Literature Review.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Meningococcal arthritis is a rare manifestation of invasive meningococcal disease, accounting for 1-12.5% of cases. Accurate diagnosis relies on synovial fluid analysis, blood cultures, and molecular techniques. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old male with a history of renal and rectal cancer presented with fever, lower limb oedema, and headache. Laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers. Synovial fluid analysis was performed, and while cultures were negative, FilmArray Sepsis(R) Panel PCR was positive for Neisseria meningitidis, confirming the diagnosis of meningococcal septic arthritis. DISCUSSION: A review of nine culture-negative meningococcal arthritis cases diagnosed using molecular methods is presented. Molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly PCR, offer significant advantages over traditional culture methods, including higher sensitivity and the ability to detect pathogens after antibiotic administration. In England and Wales, meningococcal septic arthritis represented 2% of all invasive meningococcal disease cases from 2010-2020. This case highlights the importance of molecular diagnostic techniques in accurately diagnosing meningococcal arthritis, especially when traditional culture methods fail. PCR-based methods are becoming essential tools in the management of this condition, potentially revealing a higher incidence than previously recognised."
20003418,Combination effect of antithrombin and recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in a lipopolysaccharide induced rat sepsis model.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) is newly developed for the treatment of DIC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant administration of rhsTM and antithrombin (AT). METHODS: In the first series, rats were treated with either 62.5, 125, 250 or 500 IU/kg (n = 6, each) of AT or 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg (n = 6, each) of rhsTM followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. 8 h later, the fibrinogen level was examined. In the second series, TM group was pretreated with 0.25 mg/kg of rhsTM, AT group was pretreated with 125 IU/kg of AT, AT/TM group was pretreated with both AT and rhsTM, and control group was pretreated with saline (n = 7, each). The platelet count, fibrinogen, ALT, LDH and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels were measured. In addition, histologic changes in liver were examined. In the third series, survival was calculated up to 24 h. RESULTS: Both AT and rhsTM produced a linear dose-response with regard to the fibrinogen level, with 125 IU/kg of AT and 0.25 mg/kg of rhsTM producing equivalent effects. The combined administration of AT and rhsTM significantly reduced the decrease in the platelet count and the fibrinogen level (P < 0.05, 0.01, respectively). The elevations in ALT and LDH were significantly suppressed in all treatment groups. The HMGB1 level and the histologic changes tended to indicate damage reduction. Survival was significantly better only in AT/TM group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The coadministration of AT and rhsTM might be effective for the treatment of severe sepsis."

41418341,Revisiting the time to positivity in blood cultures as a prediagnostic tool: an in vitro experiment and retrospective study.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an acute response to infection; rapid detection of pathogens is essential. In this work, the time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture (BC), a key factor for species diagnosis, was studied. METHODS: In the experimental phase, six bacterial reference strains were tested under varying conditions, and three years of clinical blood culture data were reviewed. A total of 4,924 first positive BC bottles from 3864 patients hospitalized from 2019 to 2021 were analysed. RESULTS: Experimental results revealed that reducing the inoculum by a factor of 10 increased the TTP by an average of 1.5 hours. A blood sample volume between 1 and 3 mL per vial significantly improved bacterial detection. Each hour of delay before incubation reduced the TTP by 21 minutes; however, the overall TTP was still prolonged. Bacterial growth and viability were preserved at room temperature for up to 24 h. TTP could be exploited as a first diagnostic tool, as it significantly varied between species. Staphylococcus aureus can be differentiated from coagulase-negative staphylococci when the TTP is <12 hours (Specificity (Sp) = 0.95, positive predictive value (PPV) = 62 %, negative predictive value (NPV) = 76 %), and Enterobacteriaceae can be differentiated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the same threshold (Sensibility (Se) = 0.70, Sp = 0.93, PPV = 99 %). A TTP >15 hours exclude clinically relevant pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and S. pyogenes. CONCLUSION: This work shows how preanalytical factors play a major role in the time required for diagnosis, and highlights the potential of the TTP as a prediagnostic tool to improve sepsis management."
41456737,Endothelial Glycocalyx biomarkers in acute lung injury.,2026,"Endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation contributes to vascular and pulmonary dysfunction in acute lung injury (ALI). This study provides a comprehensive review of the structure of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) and the mechanisms underlying its injury. Additionally, it evaluates biomarkers indicative of glycocalyx disruption that have been investigated for clinical use, including syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronan. These biomarkers have been studied in both circulating and airway compartments, with some studies reporting signal size-dependent variations in their levels. Laboratory measurement methods, specifically immunoassays and mass spectrometry, are examined with an emphasis on preanalytical variables, analytical performance, interference, and existing deficiencies in standardization, calibration, and traceability. These deficiencies contribute to the challenges in achieving comparability across different studies. Subsequently, we assessed the evidence regarding the clinical utility of risk stratification and outcome prediction in the context of ALI/ARDS and sepsis heterogeneity, focusing on cohort characteristics, sampling intervals, and sample types. In conclusion, we propose the implementation of novel glycocalyx-stabilizing treatments and future advancements, such as multi-marker panels and their integration with microvascular imaging. Generally, the standardization of protocols and establishment of reporting systems are essential prerequisites for the incorporation of these biomarkers into routine clinical laboratory and intensive care unit workflows as reliable tools."

15673932,Diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation in sepsis scoring system of a thrombosis-hemostasis center.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a septic complication that is not easily diagnosed. The purpose of the study is to obtain a scoring system to diagnose DIC in sepsis. SUBJECT AND METHODS: An observational study with a cross-sectional design was performed at the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital from February to August 2002. Subjects were septic patients in the emergency unit or inpatient ward of the Department of Internal Medicine, and were taken consecutively. The criteria of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were based on ACCP/SCCM Consensus 1991. The evaluation conformed to the Thrombosis Hemostasis Center (THC) scoring system, compared with modified Bick scoring system as a gold standard. RESULTS: There were 34 subjects ranging from 19 to 78 years old, 32.4% were septic patients, 41.2% with severe sepsis and 26.5% with septic shock. The most common source of infection was pneumonia, where bacterial pathogens were found in 35.2% of blood aerobic culture and 17.7% in pus or urine culture. Gram negative bacteria was the most common pathogen found. According to a modified Bick and THC scoring system, DIC was found in all subjects, consisting of mild and moderate DIC. No severe DIC was found. There was no difference between both scoring systems, with a p value of 0.125 based on the Mc Nemar test. There was no difference found in mild and moderate DIC in sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock of modified Bick scoring systems (p value of 0.987) and THC scoring system (p value of 1.000). CONCLUSION: No difference was found between THC and modified Bick scoring system in diagnosing DIC in septic patients. In sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, mild and moderate DIC complications can be diagnosed with THC scoring system, which are of the same potency with the modified Bick, with the assumption that the modified Bick scoring system was the same as the Bick scoring system."
32166230,Risk Adjustment for Sepsis Mortality to Facilitate Hospital Comparisons Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Adult Sepsis Event Criteria and Routine Electronic Clinical Data.,2019,"Variability in hospital-level sepsis mortality rates may be due to differences in case mix, quality of care, or diagnosis and coding practices. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Adult Sepsis Event definition could facilitate objective comparisons of sepsis mortality rates between hospitals but requires rigorous risk-adjustment tools. We developed risk-adjustment models for Adult Sepsis Events using administrative and electronic health record data. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One hundred thirty-six U.S. hospitals in Cerner HealthFacts (derivation dataset) and 137 HCA Healthcare hospitals (validation dataset). PATIENTS: A total of 95,154 hospitalized adult patients (derivation) and 201,997 patients (validation) meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event criteria. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We created logistic regression models of increasing complexity using administrative and electronic health record data to predict in-hospital mortality. An administrative model using demographics, comorbidities, and coded markers of severity of illness at admission achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.770-0.783) in the Cerner cohort, with diminishing calibration at higher baseline risk deciles. An electronic health record-based model that integrated administrative data with laboratory results, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.826 (95% CI, 0.820-0.831) in the derivation cohort and 0.827 (95% CI, 0.824-0.829) in the validation cohort, with better calibration than the administrative model. Adding vital signs and Glasgow Coma Score minimally improved performance. CONCLUSIONS: Models incorporating electronic health record data accurately predict hospital mortality for patients with Adult Sepsis Events and outperform models using administrative data alone. Utilizing laboratory test results, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation without vital signs may achieve a good balance between data collection needs and model performance, but electronic health record-based models must be attentive to potential variability in data quality and availability. With ongoing testing and refinement of these risk-adjustment models, Adult Sepsis Event surveillance may enable more meaningful comparisons of hospital sepsis outcomes and provide an important window into quality of care."
41624884,Identification and validation of an endotoxin tolerance-based prognostic model with therapeutic insights in sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis outcomes remain difficult to predict because immune trajectories are heterogeneous and dynamically shift from early activation to immunosuppression. Endotoxin tolerance (ET) in circulating monocytes/macrophages is a key mechanism of sepsis-associated immunosuppression but has not been systematically leveraged for prognostication. We sought to develop and clinically validate an ET-related gene (ETG) signature for short-term mortality risk stratification. METHOD: Public whole-blood transcriptomic datasets were intersected with curated ET gene sets to derive ETG candidates. An ensemble machine-learning framework (108 model/feature-selection combinations across 12 algorithms) was used to build and rank prognostic models for 28-day mortality; the final parsimonious signature (10 ETGs, including IL4R, ATM, CX3CR1, FCGR1A) informed a risk score. A two-variable nomogram (age + ETG risk score) was constructed. Internal performance was assessed by bootstrapped calibration, time-dependent ROC/AUC at 7, 14, and 28 days, and Harrell's C-index. Experimental validation used a prospective ICU cohort (n=50; 13 survivors, 37 non-survivors). PBMCs were profiled by RT-qPCR and Western blot; CD14(+) monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for FCGR1A/CD64, CX3CR1, and PD-1. We further explored regulatory context (ceRNA network) and druggability (DGIdb query and molecular docking to CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5). RESULTS: The 10-gene ETG signature stratified mortality risk with acceptable discrimination and calibration. AUCs were 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.83), 0.78 (0.72-0.83), and 0.73 (0.67-0.78) at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively; Harrell's C-index was 0.782. The age-integrated nomogram showed close agreement between predicted and observed survival across timepoints. Functional enrichment indicated immune-response pathways enriched in the low-risk group. In the clinical cohort, non-survivors exhibited lower mRNA and protein levels of FCGR1A, TLR5, and CX3CR1 in PBMCs; flow cytometry revealed reduced proportions of FCGR1A(+), CX3CR1(+), and PD-1(+) CD14(+) monocytes (p<0.01). The ceRNA analysis highlighted a putative NEAT1/miR-1287-5p/CX3CR1 axis. Docking suggested plausible ligandability of CX3CR1, FCGR1A, and TLR5, nominating candidates such as valproic acid and CGP-52608 for follow-up testing. CONCLUSION: An ET-anchored, 10-gene signature captures a clinically relevant axis of sepsis-associated immunosuppression and enables short-term mortality risk stratification. Integration with age yields a simple nomogram with stable internal performance. Multilayer validation (transcript, protein, single-cell) supports biological plausibility. Prospective multicenter studies with richer clinical annotation and functional assays are warranted to confirm generalizability and to evaluate ET-guided immunomodulatory strategies."

The impact of antibiotic-resistant infections on mortality, hospital stay, and treatment costs was assessed among children admitted to a national referral hospital in Kenya in the present study. A retrospective review of medical records for pediatric patients (0-12 years) hospitalized with bacterial infections between January 2017 and December 2021 was conducted. Diagnoses included gastroenteritis, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and others. Data on treatment, laboratory testing, outcomes, hospital stays, and costs were abstracted. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression, and mixed-effects negative binomial and generalized linear models. Among 1,608 patients, 63% were infants, and 38% were referrals. Gastroenteritis (46%) and pneumonia (28%) were the most common diagnoses. Antibiotic-resistant infections occurred in 27% of participants and were associated with higher mortality (26% versus 9% in susceptible participants) and an attributable risk of 17%; the population attributable fraction was 65%. After adjustment, resistance was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.44), longer hospital stays (60% increase), and higher treatment costs (33% increase). Antimicrobial resistance significantly increases mortality, hospital stays, and healthcare costs in pediatric patients. Strengthening diagnostics, antimicrobial stewardship, and policy interventions is critical to address this threat."
15685895,"Vascular graft infection in aortoiliac and aortofemoral bypass surgery: clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies and results of surgical treatment.",2004,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the prevalence, diagnostic procedures and clinical outcome of infections of aortoiliac and aortofemoral vascular grafts presented in our centre. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS: All patients who underwent a surgical aortoiliac or aortofemoral revascularisation between 1991 and 2001. METHODS: Evaluation of several hospital databases. RESULTS: 32 cases of aortoiliac and aortofemoral vascular graft infection with varied clinical presentation were found. Enteral bleeding was the first clinical manifestation in 31% of the cases, inguinal swelling, wound, or fistula in 59% and fever or sepsis in 6.3%. In 3% the cause was unknown. The vast majority (84.5%) of the infections presented three or more months after surgery (late infections). In cases of enteral bleeding, endoscopy procedures only revealed the diagnosis in 55%. Diagnostic algorithms including an abdominal CT scan appeared to have a sensitivity of 94% for establishing an accurate diagnosis. Remarkably, no specific risk factors for graft infection could be demonstrated. Furthermore, a 30-day survival of 20% or less was observed in early graft infections, whereas late infections managed with extra-anatomical bypasses appeared to have a better survival rate of up to 70%. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy in cases of enteral bleeding and CT scanning overall were shown to be very useful for establishing the diagnosis. Clinical outcome and survival after treatment remain poor."
31857289,Streptococcus constellatus: a rare causative agent of pyogenic liver abscess.,2019,"A 26-year-old man who was previously well presented to the emergency in septic shock. He had a preceding history of fever, right upper abdominal pain and jaundice. On examination, there was tenderness over the right hypochondrium and epigastrium, without features of generalised peritonitis. His blood tests were suggestive of sepsis with deranged liver function tests. CT scan of the abdomen showed multiples abscesses in various segments of the liver and a thrombus in the inferior venacava, without any other intraabdominal focus of infection. The abscess was aspirated under sonographic guidance, and the cultures grew Streptococcus constellatus species of S. milleri group (SMG). He received crystalline penicillin, based on culture sensitivity and underwent drainage of the abscess. There was a clinical improvement and he was subsequently discharged in a stable condition. On 3 months follow-up, there was a complete resolution of the liver abscess and normalisation of the liver function tests."
41418999,"Damage-associated Molecular Patterns, Immunothrombosis, and Intravascular Inflammation in Sepsis: A Narrative Integrative Review.",2025,"Sepsis is now considered a dysregulated host response in which inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial injury converge to create a self-amplifying network of thromboinflammation. This definition reflects maladaptive immunothrombosis-a defense mechanism that becomes pathogenic when excessive, rather than an isolated inflammatory process. This review integrates recent mechanistic advances linking damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), endothelial dysfunction, and intravascular coagulation. Endogenous alarmins, such as high-mobility group box 1, histones, and mitochondrial DNA, engage in pattern recognition (Toll-like receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products) to propagate leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation, and endothelial disruption. The resulting loss of critical endothelial anticoagulant molecules (thrombomodulin, endothelial cell protein C receptor, antithrombin) and glycocalyx degradation convert the vascular endothelium into a procoagulant interface. Complement activation and protease-activated receptor signaling reinforce this loop, producing microvascular thrombosis, capillary leakage, and organ ischemia. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) serve as intravascular scaffolds for fibrin deposition, thereby propagating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Targeted interventions, including recombinant thrombomodulin, antithrombin supplementation, neutralization of NETs and DAMPs, complement blockade, and endothelial-protective strategies, seek to restore vascular homeostasis. A multidomain biomarker approach integrating DAMPs, endothelial markers, and coagulation indices, combined with machine learning-based phenotyping, may enable precision stratification of sepsis endotypes. The convergence of DAMP signaling, immune activation, and coagulation underlies the pathophysiologic continuum from sepsis-induced coagulopathy to DIC. Therapeutically interrupting this axis represents the most promising avenue toward personalized, mechanism-driven treatment in sepsis."
31808644,[Bilateral acute purulent destructive pyelonephritis after retrograde ureteroscopy and lithotripsy].,2019,"The problem of urinary stone disease and acute destructive pyelonephritis remains to be relevant in the current urologic practice. The acute pyelonephritis is the most common infectious and inflammatory complication after retrograde ureteroscopy. According to data of leading urologists in Russian Federation and worldwide, the incidence of acute purulent pyelonephritis ranges from 0.1 to 0.2%. Infectious and inflammatory complications of retrograde ureteroscopy often require urgent interventions. Acute pyelonephritis can result in destructive changes in the renal parenchyma. In case of ineffective conservative measures, pyelonephritis can progress into sepsis with the development of multiple organ failure. Therefore, infectious and inflammatory complications require to start combined antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and detoxification therapy, as well as to resolve any upper urinary tract obstruction. If acute pyelonephritis leads to destructive phase with a formation of a carbuncle or an abscess in the kidney, an open surgery is indicated. Despite being minimally-invasive, retrograde ureteroscopy can lead to serious complications requiring an open surgical intervention. In some cases, the severity of the patients condition may require nephrectomy."
31878921,Establishing a hospital transfusion management system promotes appropriate clinical use of human albumin in Japan: a nationwide retrospective study.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Despite international recommendations to establish hospital transfusion management systems to promote appropriate use of blood products, the general efficacy of establishing such systems has not been proven. This study aimed to validate the effect of establishing such systems for promoting the appropriate use of human albumin. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we used a Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database from fiscal year 2012 to 2016, which included inpatient records from approximately 1200 hospitals for payment processes in the national medical insurance system. From this existing database, containing approximately 8 million inpatient records per year, we selected patients with emergency due to ""bleeding,"" ""sepsis,"" and ""burn injury,"" by using the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, and hospitals that had one or more patients for each disease group in each fiscal year. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the relationship between human albumin administration and the state of the hospital transfusion management system. We evaluated temporal trends of mortality rate and length of stay as an indicator of care quality. RESULTS: Overall, 139,853 eligible patients admitted to 682 hospitals were selected. The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis show that patients who were admitted to hospitals with an established hospital transfusion department introducing good practice criteria of blood products were less likely to be administered human albumin compared with those who were admitted to hospitals not introducing it, by approximately 30% for each of the three disease groups; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidential intervals) were 0.70 (0.59-0.83), 0.75 (0.69-0.81), and 0.71 (0.58-0.87) in the ""bleeding,"" ""sepsis,"" and ""burn injury"" groups, respectively. The temporal trends evaluation shows that there were no increasing trends of mortality rate and average length of stay against decreasing trends of human albumin administration in any disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a hospital transfusion department responsible for promoting appropriate clinical use of blood products could reduce human albumin administration for critically ill patients without loss of care quality. These findings provide support for policy makers and hospital managers to consider establishing such systems."
25497738,Effect of 593C>T GPx1 SNP alone and in synergy with 47C>T SOD2 SNP on the outcome of critically ill patients.,2015,"During critical illness and sepsis there is severe antioxidant depletion, and this scenario raises the critical ill patient's mortality risk. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is one of the first endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes, and it works cooperatively with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to detoxify free radicals from the cellular environment. Genetic studies are important to understand the complexity of human oxidative stress and how the organism responds to an extreme situation such as critically care conditions. Previous studies with a GPx1 single nucleotide polymorphism (593C>T SNP; rs1050450; protein variant in GPx1: Pro198Leu) showed 593T carriers and 593TT homozygotes present higher risk to develop different diseases. We assessed the relationship of the genotype distribution of GPx1 SNP in critically ill patients with their conditions (organ dysfunction, sepsis, and septic shock) and their outcome. We monitored 626 critically ill patients daily from the ICU (intensive care unit) admission to their discharge from hospital, or death. Our study revealed a significant association between 593TT GPx1 genotype and mortality; the mortality rate was higher in homozygous 593TT GPx1 (N=94) when compared with the group of subjects with genotypes 593CT or 593CC GPx1 (N=532) (52% vs. 38%, P=0.009; OR=1.79; 95% CI=1.13-2.85). Evaluating the subgroup of 293 ICU patients with sepsis, a pooled analysis including two genetic variants GPx1 and SOD2 (47C>T SNP, rs4880; protein variant in MnSOD: Ala-9Val) showed a significant difference in relation to progression to septic shock. The frequency of septic shock among septic patients with 593T GPx1 and 47C SOD2 alleles (N=122) was higher when compared with septic patients carrying other settings of genotypes (N=174) (78% vs. 66%; P=0.028; OR=1.81; 95% CI=1.03-3.18). Accepting the previously reported functional effects of these two SNPs on GPx1 and SOD2 gene expressions and, consequently, on GPx1 and MnSOD enzyme activities, we believe our results may be considered as an important contribution for the understanding of oxidative imbalance during the critical ill."
31821188,Cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial treatment for inpatients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection: a systematic review of economic evidence.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy for patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. INTRODUCTION: Among the main multi-resistant microorganisms, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae is responsible for the mortality of 40% of patients following 30 days of infection. Treatment for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection entails the use of high-cost antimicrobials. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials can increase the cost of treatment fourfold. This review aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy treatment for patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection to better inform decision making in hospital services. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The review included studies on participants 18 years or over with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection who had undergone antimicrobial therapy in hospital and acute care services. Studies that compared the cost-effectiveness of different antimicrobial therapy for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection were included. Outcome measures were cost per unit of effect expressed in clinical outcome units; this included cost per avoided death, cost per prevention of sepsis and cost per duration of stay. Economic studies with a cost-effectiveness design were considered, as well as modeling studies. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was utilized to locate studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese, with no date restrictions. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and the full texts of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the JBI critical appraisal checklist for economic evaluations. Data were extracted from included studies using the standardized JBI data extraction tool. Data were synthesized using narrative, tables and the JBI Dominance Ranking Matrix. RESULTS: This review identified eight studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different treatments for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection. The results of this study demonstrated that there was no gold standard treatment for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection, hence treatment was generally directed by colonization pressure and resistance profiles. Furthermore, due to the moderate quality and limited number of studies, there was high uncertainty of the values of the cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin appears to be the most cost-effective treatment; however, conclusions are limited due to the small number and low quality of studies."

41430966,"Klebsiella pneumonia liver abscess causing bacteremia, pneumonia, and secondary brain abscess: A case report.",2025,"RATIONALE: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) can cause an invasive syndrome characterized by multi-organ abscesses. While liver abscess and bacteremia are common, secondary brain abscess is a rare but life-threatening complication. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in managing such severe KPIS cases and to emphasize key management strategies that can lead to successful outcomes, thereby enhancing clinician awareness of this complex syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 37-year-old male presented with fever and altered mental status, which subsequently progressed to septic shock and hypoxemia, requiring intensive care. DIAGNOSES: KPIS with liver abscess, bacteremia, pneumonia, and secondary brain abscess due to hvKp infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received meropenem via extended infusion, fluid resuscitation, glycemic control, and supportive care. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition improved significantly within 5 days of targeted therapy, manifested by the resolution of fever, successful extubation, and normalization of key laboratory parameters (including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin). He was discharged from the ICU after 15 days, exhibiting only mild residual right-sided weakness. Crucially, follow-up imaging at 3 months revealed complete resolution of the liver and brain abscesses, with no evidence of recurrence. LESSONS: This case underscores the importance of early recognition, aggressive antimicrobial therapy, glycemic control, and the utility of next-generation sequencing in diagnosing hvKp infections. Strict glycemic management and susceptibility-guided therapy are critical to preventing complications and improving outcomes."
31859962,[Immunocompetent adults hospitalized for a community-acquired pneumonia: Serum C-reactive protein as a prognostic marker].,2019,"BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is used to monitor patients' response during treatment of infectious diseases. Morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high, particularly in hospitalized patients. Better risk prediction during hospitalization could improve management and ultimately reduce mortality rates. AIM: To evaluate CRP measured at admission and the third day of hospitalization as a predictor for adverse events in CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP at an academic hospital. Major adverse outcomes were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital length of stay, hospital complications and 30-day mortality. Predictive associations between CRP (as absolute levels and relative decline at third day) and adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight hundred and twenty-three patients were assessed, 19% were admitted to ICU and 10.6% required mechanical ventilation. The average hospital stay was 8.8 +/- 8.2 days, 42% had nosocomial complications and 8.1% died within 30 days. Ninety eight percent of patients had elevated serum CRP on admission to the hospital (18.1 +/- 14.1 mg/dL). C-reactive protein measured at admission was associated with the risk of bacterial pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, septic shock and use of mechanical ventilation. Lack of CRP decline within three days of hospitalization was associated with high risk of complications, septic shock, mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: CRP responses at third day of hospital admission was a valuable predictor of adverse events in hospitalized CAP adult patients."
41458356,"Comprehensive Review of Sepsis-Related Skeletal Muscle Atrophy: Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Therapeutic Strategies.",2025,"This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current evidence on sepsis-related skeletal muscle atrophy, with a focus on underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic interventions. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to October 2024, including clinical, translational, and animal studies. We critically analyzed the pathophysiological mechanisms linking sepsis to muscle wasting, including inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteolytic pathways. Epidemiological data indicate a high incidence of muscle atrophy in sepsis patients, particularly among the elderly and those with comorbidities. Diagnostic modalities such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, and emerging biomarkers including urinary titin and myokines are discussed. Treatment strategies encompassing nutritional support, pharmacotherapy (eg, GLP-1RAs, myostatin inhibitors), and rehabilitation are evaluated. Controversies regarding etiology and treatment efficacy are highlighted. Future directions include the exploration of novel biomarkers, genomics-based personalized therapy, and long-term outcome studies. This review provides a structured and critical appraisal of the current state of knowledge, aiming to inform clinical practice and future research."
20361129,[Prognostic factors and mortality in immunocompetent adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia].,2009,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. AIM: To describe baseline characteristics, risk factors and clinical outcomes of adult patients hospitalized with pneumococcal pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study of adult patients admitted for a community acquired pneumonia in a clinical hospital. Immune deficient patients and those with a history of a recent hospitalization were excluded. RESULTS: One hundred fifty one immuno-competent patients, aged 16 to 92 years, 58% males, were studied. Seventy-five percent had other diseases, 26% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 9% needed mechanical ventilation. There were no differences in clinical features, ICU admission or hospital length of stay among bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients. Thirty days lethality for bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients was 10.9% and 11.5%, respectively. The predictive values for lethality of Fine pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, 65 years of age and older) had an area under the ROC curve of 0.8 and 0.69, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed blood urea nitrogen over 30 mg/ dL (odds ratio (OR), 6.8), need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 7.4) and diastolic blood pressure below 50 mmHg (OR, 3.9), as significant independent predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a substantial rate of complications and mortality. Clinical presentation and outcome did not differ significantly among patients with and without bacteremia."
15646073,In vivo dynamics of the 103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV-infected patients: preliminary results.,2004,"Due to the preferential selection of the fittest HIV mutants, drug-resistant variants are often overgrown by wild-type virus after treatment interruption. Our objective was to investigate the dynamics of the 103N mutation (which usually does not reduce HIV fitness) following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Patients who were found to have the 103N mutation at or after failure of a NNRTI were selected from an observational database. Two groups of patients were identified: one which continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A) and one which discontinued all anti-retrovirals after failure of an NNRTI (group B). Genotype was obtained by direct sequencing of the replicating plasma virus. Sixty-two subjects tested between July 1998 and December 2002 were included in the analysis, 39 in group A and 23 in group B. At the time of the first resistance test, median (IQR) CD4+ T-lymphocytes and HIV-RNA were 269 (150-449) cells/microL and 25,000 (9,600-83,300) copies/mL. In 31 (50%), 30 (48%), and one case (2%), the 103N mutation was selected by nevirapine, efavirenz, and by delavirdine, respectively. A total of 149 tests were analyzed, with a median (IQR) of 2 (2-3) tests/patient. The median (IQR) interval between failure of NNRTIs and the last resistance test was 11 (5-22) months. Overall, a reversion to wild-type at position 103 was observed in 23/62 (37%) subjects, 14/39 (36%) in group A and 9/23 (39%) in group B. In group A, 14/23 (61%) patients tested within 12 months, 10/16 (63%) of those tested between 12 and 24 months, and 12/14 (86%) of those tested beyond 24 months from NNRTI discontinuation had the 103N mutation. In group B, 14/20 (70%) patients tested within 12 months, 3/4 (75%) of those tested between 12 and 24 months, and none out of two tested beyond 24 months from NNRTI discontinuation had the 103N mutation. In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, in the majority of patients HIV variants carrying the 103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position. This suggests that the 103N mutation per se influences minimally the viral fitness in vivo."
32056549,The association between isolated oligohydramnios at term and placental pathology in correlation with pregnancy outcomes.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Isolated term oligohydramnios (ITO) is an obstetrical complication of which the etiology, management, and clinical importance are controversial. In attempt to deepen our understanding, we aimed to study placental pathology and pregnancy outcomes in pregnancies complicated by ITO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: - Maternal demographics, neonatal outcomes, and placental histopathology reports of all pregnancies complicated by ITO at 37(0/7) to 41(0/7) weeks were reviewed. Excluded were cases complicated by hypertensive disorders, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and deliveries of undiagnosed small for gestational age neonates. Results were compared between the ITO group and a control group matched for gestational age and mode of delivery. Placental lesions were classified according to the current ""Amsterdam"" criteria. Composite adverse neonatal outcome was defined as one or more of the following early complications: neonatal intensive care unit admission, sepsis, blood transfusion, phototherapy, respiratory morbidity, cerebral morbidity, necrotizing enterocolitis, or death. RESULTS: The study group included 108 patients with ITO that were compared to matched controls. Placentas from the ITO group were characterized by higher rates of placental weights <10th centile (p < 0.001), abnormal cord insertion (p < 0.001), and maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) lesions (p < 0.001). Neonates from the ITO group had lower birth weights (p < 0.002), and worse composite adverse neonatal outcome (p = 0.028) compared to controls. CONCLUSION: - The current study demonstrates higher rates of placental MVM lesions, and worse neonatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by ITO. These novel findings suggest that ITO should be seen as part of the ""placental insufficiency"" spectrum."
31825505,"Incidence of, Risk Factors for, and Mortality Associated With Severe Acute Kidney Injury After Gunshot Wound.",2019,"IMPORTANCE: Acute kidney injury increases the risk of mortality in hospitalized patients. However, incidence of severe acute kidney injury (SAKI) and its association with mortality in civilians with gunshot wounds (GSWs) is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with SAKI and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI-D) after GSWs and the association of SAKI and AKI-D with mortality among civilians in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included civilians with GSW reported to the National Trauma Data Bank between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. Torso GSWs were included in study; GSWs to the head were excluded. The data were analyzed between September and November 2018. EXPOSURE: Civilians with GSW. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of SAKI and AKI-D; association of SAKI and AKI-D with mortality. RESULTS: Most of the 64 059 civilian GSWs affected men (57 431 [89.7%]) and racial/ethnic minorities (36 205 [56.5%] African American individuals; 9681 [15.1%] Hispanic individuals). Incidence of SAKI was 2.3% (1450 of 64 059), and incidence of AKI-D was 0.9% (588 of 64 059). On multivariate analysis, SAKI was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; P < .001), male sex (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.66; P = .002), diabetes (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.20-2.00; P = .001), hypertension (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.46-2.11; P < .001), Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P = .002), sepsis (OR, 13.83; 95% CI, 11.77-16.24; P < .001), hollow viscus injury (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.05-2.59; P < .001), and injury severity score (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; P < .001); AKI-D was associated with systolic blood pressure (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P < .001), sepsis (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.18-2.04; P = .001), and injury severity score (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; P = .001). Mortality was significantly higher in patients with AKI-D (167 of 588 patients [28.4%]) compared with patients with SAKI (172 of 862 [20.0%]) and no SAKI or AKI-D (5521 of 62 609 [8.8%]) (P < .001). Mortality was associated with older age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P < .001), systolic blood pressure (OR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.997-0.998; P < .001), Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.87-0.88; P < .001), SAKI (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.93-2.79; P < .001), AKI-D (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.90; P < .001), hollow viscus injury (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.76-1.98; P < .001), and higher injury severity score (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P < .001). After matching for variables except SAKI or AKI-D, patients with SAKI were twice as likely to die than patients without SAKI (320 of 1391 [23.0%] vs 158 of 1391 [11.4%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, SAKI among civilians who experienced GSWs was associated with mortality."
15709801,[A comparative study of blood culture conventional method vs. a modified lysis/centrifugation technique for the diagnosis of fungemias].,2004,"The purpose of this work was to compare the efficacy of blood culture conventional method vs. a modified lysis/centrifugation technique. Out of 450 blood specimens received in one year, 100 where chosen for this comparative study: 60 from patients with AIDS, 15 from leukemic patients, ten from febrile neutropenic patients, five from patients with respiratory infections, five from diabetics and five from septicemic patients. The specimens were processed, simultaneously, according to the above mentioned methodologies with daily inspections searching for fungal growth in order to obtain the final identification of the causative agent. The number (40) of isolates recovered was the same using both methods, which included; 18 Candida albicans (45%), ten Candida spp. (25%), ten Histoplasma capsulatum (25%), and two Cryptococcus neoformans (5%). When the fungal growth time was compared by both methods, growth was more rapid when using the modified lysis/centrifugation technique than when using the conventional method. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference (p<0.05) between them. The modified lysis/centrifugation technique showed to be more efficacious than the conventional one, and therefore the implementation of this methodology is highly recommended for the isolation of fungi from blood."
25538326,Endocan: a novel circulating proteoglycan.,2014,"Endocan is a novel endothelium derived soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. It has the property of binding to a wide range of bioactive molecules associated with cellular signaling and adhesion and thus regulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and adhesion of different cell types in health and disease. An increase in tissue expression or serum level of endocan reflects endothelial activation and neovascularization which are prominent pathophysiological changes associated with inflammation and tumor progression. Consequently, endocan has been used as a blood-based and tissue-based biomarker for various cancers and inflammation and has shown promising results."
41448497,Causal models and network instability in neurological and psychiatric disorders: Computational and clinical perspectives.,2026,"Self-diagnosis-the capacity of a system to detect and correct its own failures-is a defining property of adaptive systems. In the brain, recursive self-monitoring underlies perception, action, and cognition, but it is also fragile: small imbalances between priors and prediction errors can destabilize entire networks. Similar recursive instabilities are observed in immune collapse during sepsis and in failure modes of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we advance a unified framework of causal models and network instability, integrating predictive coding, computational psychiatry, network neuroscience, immunology, and AI. We analyze Parkinson's disease and sepsis as full case studies, and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as psychiatric parallels. Across these conditions, recursive failures manifest as rigid priors, amplified errors, or oscillatory attractors. Across neurological, psychiatric, and immune systems, recursive instability emerges when imbalances between prior precision and prediction-error precision destabilize feedback loops, leading to rigid, noise-amplified, or oscillatory dynamics. By framing Parkinson's disease, sepsis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder within a shared instability space, the proposed framework links predictive coding with network-level dynamics across biological domains. Clinically, this perspective motivates the development of state-dependent biomarkers and closed-loop interventions-such as adaptive neuromodulation and bioelectronic control-designed to stabilize recursive feedback rather than relying on static, open-loop therapies. Recognizing recursive instability as a transdiagnostic principle highlights shared vulnerabilities across brains, immune systems, and artificial agents, and points toward AI-augmented, causal, and adaptive interventions that integrate computational insight with clinical practice."
25697246,[Red blood cell transfusions in very low birth weight newborns].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: It has been reported that 80% of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) are receiving packed red blood cell transfusions (PRBCtr), and in 90% of cases, the indication is the replacement of the blood collected. The existence of guidelines for transfusion practices has had a great impact on the decline in the number of transfusions. The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of VLBW infants who are packed red blood cell transfusion receptors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, which included the medical records of all VLBW newborns older than 72 hours, released from the Neonatology department of the Hospital Valdivia Base, between 2005 and 2006. Birth weight, gestational age, pulmonary surfactant, hyaline membrane, mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis and packed red blood cell transfusions were evaluated. Guidelines for packed red cell transfusions were used at the Hospital. RESULTS: 93 newborns were evaluated and 62 of them were transfused (66.7%); they received 2.1 +/- 0.9 PRBC transfusion and the exposure to different donors was 2.1 +/- 0.9. The VLBW infants susceptible to be PRBCtr receptor were those younger than 30 weeks' gestational age, weighing less than 1,250 g and with respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation and sepsis. CONCLUSION: The observed percentages of transfused infants with very low birth weight, median PRBCtr and exposure to different donors can be attributed to the existence of guidelines for neonatal transfusion practices and a team of highly experienced neonatologists."
32041916,Factors Associated with Mortality of Intensive Care Unit Patients with Acute Kidney Injury at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital.,2019,"BACKGROUND: the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care units is associated with increased mortality, post AKI morbidity and high treatment costs. Research on factors related to mortality of AKI patients in intensive care units in Indonesia, especially Cipto Mangungkusumo General Hospital has never been done. This study aims to determine the prevalence of AKI, mortality rate of AKI patients, and the factors associated with increased mortality of AKI patients in intensive care units in ICU Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. METHODS: this is a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with AKI in the intensive care unit at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, January 2015 - December 2016. An analysis of bivariate relationships with multvariate with STATA Statistics 15.0 between age > 60 years, sepsis, use of ventilator, ventilator duration, dialysis, oligoanuria, and APACHE II scores at admission with mortality. RESULTS: the prevalence of AKI patients in the intensive care unit was 12.25% (675 of 5511 subjects) and 220 subjects (32.59%) of the 675 analyzed subjects died in the intensive care unit. Factors related to increased mortality in multivariate analysis were sepsis (OR 6,174; IK95% 3,116-12,233), oligoanuria (OR 4,173; IK95% 2,104-8,274), use of ventilator (OR 3,085; IK95% 1,348-7,057), (scores APACHE II at admission) 1/2 [OR 1,597; IK95% 1.154-2.209], and the duration of the ventilator (OR 1.062; IK95% 1.012-1.114). CONCLUSION: the prevalence of AKI patients and their mortality rate in the intensive care unit of Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital obtained 12.25% and 32.59%. Sepsis, oligoanuria, ventilators (APACHE II score at admission) 1/2, and ventilator duration are factors that are significantly associated with increased mortality of AKI patients in intensive care units."
15711675,Outcome of pregnancies with preterm premature rupture of membranes.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of pregnancies complicated with preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) between 26-36 week gestation. METHODS: A retrospective study of 36670 pregnancies registered and managed in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from March 1993 to February 2003. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty cases of PPROM (0.6%) were registered and treated expectantly out of 36670 total pregnancies registered during the study period. The majority of the cases (38.6%) were delivered within 72 hours of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM). Only 2.3% of the cases were prolonged to a latency period of more than one month. Maternal morbidity included chorioamnionitis (20.9%), postpartum endometritis (6.8%), abruptio placentae (4%) and septicemia (0.5%). The prenatal survival rate was 94.5% whereas neonatal outcomes included neonatal mortality (5.5%), respiratory distress (15.9%), sepsis (7.7%), and necrotizing enterocolitis (3.1%). Our study showed a positive correlation between increasing maternal age and cesarean section; increased maternal and neonatal infection rates with prolonged latency; and increased risk of neonatal infection among mothers having chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of PPROM in KSA is low. Ultimate goal of therapy must be safety of the mother first. Expectant management should be the rationale if fetal immaturity exists. Induction of labor in PPROM patient > or = 34-week-gestation is a logical approach to minimize maternal infectious morbidity."
41602009,Association between HALP score and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients: a multicenter retrospective cohort study with external validation.,2025,"BACKGROUND: The HALP (Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, and Platelet) score integrates key parameters reflecting nutritional and immune status. However, its prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between HALP score and in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients using two large critical care databases. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including adult patients with Sepsis-3 from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (derivation cohort, n = 12,899) and the MIMIC-IV database (validation cohort, n = 3,726). HALP was calculated as (hemoglobin x albumin x lymphocyte count)/platelet count, using first available values upon ICU admission. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models assessed nonlinear relationships between HALP and mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression models, adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and Acute Physiology Score III, evaluated survival differences between low- and high-HALP groups. Segmented Cox regression examined associations below and above RCS-derived thresholds. RESULTS: A total of 16,625 patients were analyzed. RCS analysis demonstrated significant nonlinear associations between HALP and in-hospital mortality in both cohorts (overall P < 0.001; nonlinearity P < 0.001 in eICU, P = 0.002 in MIMIC-IV), with an inflection point near 12.45. Below this threshold, each unit increase in HALP was associated with a 3% reduction in mortality risk (eICU: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99, P = 0.002; MIMIC-IV: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed significantly higher survival in the high HALP group (eICU: log-rank P = 0.005, HR 0.882, 95% CI 0.808-0.962; MIMIC-IV: log-rank P < 0.001, HR 0.723, 95% CI 0.607-0.862). Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that high HALP remained independently protective after full adjustment (eICU: HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, P = 0.017; MIMIC-IV: HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: The HALP score demonstrates robust prognostic value for predicting in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients, with consistent nonlinear relationships validated across two large databases. Its simplicity and reliance on routine laboratory parameters support potential clinical application in sepsis risk stratification."
20028550,Cellular adaptive immune response against porcine circovirus type 2 in subclinically infected pigs.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a dominant causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a multifactorial disease complex with putative immunosuppressive characteristics. Little is known about adaptive PCV2-specific immune responses in infected pigs. Therefore, the T and B cell responses following PCV2 infection in 3-week old SPF piglets infected with PCV2 or PCV2 plus porcine parvovirus (PPV) were studied. RESULTS: All animals were asymptomatically infected. At 7 days post infection (d p.i.), B lymphocyte and T lymphocyte numbers decreased in the dual infected, but not in the single infected piglets. At this time point a transient PCV2 viraemia was noted in the PCV2 infected groups. Antibodies against the infecting virus were detectable at day 24-28 p.i. for anti-PCV2 antibodies and at day 10 p.i. for anti-PPV antibodies, with no apparent influence of PCV2 on the early PPV antibody development. In the animals infected with PPV alone, IFN-gamma secreting cells (SC) that were not specific for PCV2 were detected by ELISPOT assay at day 7 p.i. Interestingly, this response was absent in the PCV2/PPV dual infected animals. PCV2-specific IFN-gamma SC were observed in the PCV2/PPV infected group at 7 d p.i. and in the PCV2 single infected group at 21 d p.i. A reduction in the numbers of IFN-gamma SC was observed following anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibody treatment, suggesting roles for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the response against PCV2 infection. This was supported by an observed increase in the percentage of IFN-gamma positive CD8hi cytotoxic T cells as well as IFN-gamma positive CD8-/low helper T cells after PCV2 in vitro re-stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Infection of weaned SPF piglets with PCV2 alone or combined with PPV does not induce disease and in both cases a relatively slow anti-PCV2 antibody response and weak T lymphocyte responses were found. Knowledge on such immunological characteristics is important for both PCV2 pathogenesis and vaccination."
41472236,Evaluation of the Pathogenicity of Highly Virulent Eurasian Genotype II African Swine Fever Virus with MGF505-2R Gene Deletion in Piglets.,2025,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses a significant threat to the global pig industry due to high mortality rates and complex genetic variation. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) provide protection against ASFV. Previously, MGF505-2R was identified as a potent inhibitor of innate immunity in vitro. This study evaluates the pathogenicity of a recombinant Eurasian genotype II strain with the MGF505-2R gene deleted (ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R) in piglets. Twelve five-week-old crossbred piglets were divided into two groups, with one group of eight piglets inoculated with ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R (n = 8) and the other group of four piglets inoculated with the same dose of parental ASFV CN/GS 2018 (n = 4). Clinical symptoms, viral loads, and immune responses were monitored over 30 days. ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R-inoculated piglets exhibited transient fever and low viremia only in the beginning of the challenge, while the control group developed high levels of viremia and hyperthermia at day 2 and 8 post-challenge, respectively. Meanwhile, the control group demonstrated more severe post-mortem signs and immuno-histochemistry injury when compared to the DeltaMGF505-2R group. ELISA analysis displayed higher levels of IFN-beta and IL-1beta in the DeltaMGF505-2R group, further solidating the immunosuppressive role of MGF505-2R. All ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R-inoculated piglets developed high titers of ASFV-specific P30 antibodies at 10 days post-challenge. These findings rationalized the potential of ASFV-DeltaMGF505-2R as a live attenuated candidate for ASF infection."
41625880,Predictive Value of Procalcitonin and C-reactive Protein for Mortality in Live Donor Liver Transplant Recipients.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Accurate biomarkers are crucial for the early diagnosis of sepsis after liver transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting bacterial infections and mortality following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODOLOGY: We prospectively analyzed all adult LDLT patients at a tertiary center between January 2021 and December 2022. CRP and PCT levels were measured on postoperative days (POD) one, three, five, and seven, and compared among patients without infections, those with bloodstream infections, and those with other infections (urinary, bronchoalveolar lavage, or drain). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of PCT and CRP trends on short- and long-term mortality. RESULTS: Among 216 LDLT patients, 122 (56%) were analyzed after applying exclusion criteria. In patients without infections, median CRP and PCT levels were elevated on days one (CRP: 19, interquartile range (IQR): 11-29; PCT: 3, IQR: 1-13) and three (CRP: 18, IQR: 7-30; PCT: 2, IQR: 1-9) but decreased by days five (CRP: 10, IQR: 5-16; PCT: 1, IQR: 0.2-3) and seven (CRP: 10, IQR: 3-17; PCT: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-3). No absolute values of CRP or PCT effectively diagnosed infections. Patients with a decreasing trend in CRP from POD three to five to seven had survival rates of 90%, 86%, and 85% at 30, 90, and 600 days, respectively; in contrast, those with an increasing CRP trend had lower survival rates of 78%, 71%, and 40%, respectively. Similarly, a decline in PCT was associated with 30-, 90-, and 600-day survival rates of 90%, 85%, and 84%, while increasing PCT correlated with significantly lower rates of 75%, 70%, and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: While the absolute values of CRP and PCT were not diagnostic for infection, an increase in these biomarkers from days three to five to seven predicted significantly higher short- and long-term mortality in LDLT recipients."
20156705,[Outcome of critically ill patients with acute renal failure and multiple organ failure treated with continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration].,2010,"OBJECTIVE: Acute renal failure (ARF) is associated to multiple organ failure (MOF) in critically ill patients and its mortality is high. The main objective was to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients with ARF and MOF treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). DESIGN: Retrospective and observational study on critically ill patients. SETTING: Medical-surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a University Hospital of Girona. PATIENTS: Patients admitted in ICU that developed ARF and MOF and were treated with CVVHDF. PRIMARY VARIABLES OF INTEREST: We collected data on demographic, and severity and organic dysfunction scores (SOFA). To study the risk factors for mortality, a comparative and multiple regression statistical analysis was performed, with the main effect of the study being mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: We studied 139 patients. The most frequent predisposing factors were hypotension (98%) and sepsis (82%). the most frequently affected organs were cardiocirculatory (94%) and respiratory (47%) associated to ARF. Mean SOFA score was 11.4 + or - 2.7 points. Survival was better in traumatic and in non-oliguric patients. The 30-day mortality was 61% and the logistic regression analysis showed that age > or = 60 years [OR=3.3 (95% CI 95=1.5-7.0)] and SOFA score > or = 11 points [OR=2.5 (95% CI=1.1-5.3)] were related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate of critically ill patients with acute renal failure and multiple organ failure remains high. Traumatic and non-oliguric patients have a better survival. Age > or = 60 years and SOFA > or = 11 points were independent risk factors associated with mortality."
15682731,Preoperative biliary stenting--a prequel to pancreatic resection in selected patients.,2004,"INTRODUCTION: Biliary drainage is necessary to improve immediate survival in patients with profound co-morbidities associated with jaundice. We report on our experience with this category of patients in whom subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period January 2001-June 2002, 6 patients underwent biliary drainage to reverse potentially fatal complications or to optimise nutritional status. There were 2 female and 4 male patients (age range 50-70 years). The reasons for biliary drainage were suboptimal albumin levels in all patients, cholangitis in 4 patients and renal impairment in 2 male patients and profound acute jaundice in 1. RESULTS: There was failure of stent placement at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 3 patients. Two had an ERCP performed before referral and had a metal stent deployed at percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). In the other a plastic stent was placed at a combined PTC/ERCP session. The 3 others had stents placed by ERCP. None of the patients had complications related to the stenting procedure. All the lesions were deemed resectable following imaging by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. Laparotomy with intent to resect was planned once the complications had resolved. The average duration of stenting before surgery was 46 days (range 12-100 days). All patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. One patient developed postoperative superficial wound sepsis, which resolved with topical management. There were no perioperative deaths. The postoperative hospital stay ranged from 10 to 21 days. Histological examination revealed pancreatic adenocarcinomas in 4 patients, an ampullary tumour in 1 patient and a non-functioning islet cell tumour in the other. CONCLUSION: Biliary drainage for complications should not be regarded as definitive treatment. It optimises co-morbidity factors and allows staging so that resection can be carried out successfully in selected patients."
19967092,Antigenemia and specific IgM and IgG antibody responses in rabbits infected with Toxoplasma gondii.,2009,"In this experiment, the correlation between antigenemia and specific antibody responses in Toxoplasma gondii-infected rabbits was assessed. We injected 1,000 T. gondii tachyzoites (RH) subcutaneously into 5 rabbits. Parasitemia, circulating antigens, and IgM and IgG antibody titers in blood were tested by ELISA and immunoblot. For detection of parasitemia, mice were injected with blood from rabbits infected with T. gondii and mice died between days 2 and 10 post-infection (PI). Circulating antigens were detected early on day 2 PI, and the titers increased from day 4 PI and peaked on day 12 PI. Anti-Toxoplasma IgM antibody titers increased on day 6 PI and peaked on days 14-16 PI. IgG was detected from day 10 PI, and the titers increased continuously during the experiment. The antigenic protein patterns differed during the infection period, and the number of bands increased with ongoing infection by the immunoblot analysis. These result indicated that Toxoplasma circulating antigens during acute toxoplasmosis are closely related to the presence of parasites in blood. Also, the circulating antigen levels were closely correlated with IgM titers, but not with IgG titers. Therefore, co-detection of circulating antigens with IgM antibodies may improve the reliability of the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis."
41399838,"[Epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and microbiology of suppurative pyelonephritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis, part 1].",2025,"INTRODUCTION: The first part of a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing the problem of purulent pyelonephritis is presented in the article. AIM: To analyze the epidemiology, predisposing factors, diagnostic approaches, and microbiological characteristics of purulent pyelonephritis, which is a complicated form of acute pyelonephritis characterized by renal parenchymal suppuration, sepsis, or localized abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of 46 studies (1981-2024) on complicated pyelonephritis was performed. The review included clinical series (observational and one randomized trial) with more or equal 10 patients reporting on prevalence, risk factors, clinical course, diagnostic approaches, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes of severe pyelonephritis. Data were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis of key outcomes (mortality and need for surgical intervention) was carried out using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most common serious urinary tract infections, with an annual incidence of 15-17 per 10,000 women and 3-5 per 10,000 men. In most cases, the disease responds well to antibiotic therapy; however, in 20-30% of patients complicated pyelonephritis develops. Predisposing factors include diabetes mellitus, urinary tract obstruction, advanced age, male sex, immunodeficiency, and pregnancy. Diabetes mellitus is present in 30-35% of hospitalized patients with pyelonephritis (vs. 10-15% in uncomplicated cases) and in 75-95% of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis. Urolithiasis accounts for approximately 20% of cases with complicated pyelonephritis. Elderly (>65 years) and male patients are affected less frequently but experience more severe disease: men constitute only about 25% of acute pyelonephritis cases but have higher rates of abscess and sepsis. Purulent pyelonephritis is typically associated with pronounced systemic symptoms: high fever (>39 C in 70% of cases), chills (50-60%), and septic shock (25-30% upon admission). In 15-20% of severe cases, local urinary symptoms (flank pain, dysuria) are absent. Laboratory findings usually demonstrate leukocytosis >15109/L (80%) or, conversely, leukopenia <4109/L (20-30%) in cases with disseminated intravascular coagulation, along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (>100 mg/L). Imaging plays a decisive role: ultrasound can detect hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis, whereas contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the gold standard for detecting abscesses and gas formation. The main pathogens of complicated pyelonephritis are Gram-negative enteric bacteria, primarily Escherichia coli (60-75%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10-15%), and Proteus mirabilis (5-10%). In 10-30% of cases, isolates exhibit multidrug resistance (e.g., ESBL-producing strains). Polymicrobial infection occurs in approximately 5-10% of severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: Purulent pyelonephritis is a relatively uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of renal infection, strongly associated with risk factors such as diabetes and urinary obstruction. Improved patient outcomes depend on early identification of high-risk individuals, timely imaging to detect purulent complications, and empirical antibiotic therapy that accounts for likely antimicrobial resistance (treatment strategies and outcomes will be discussed in Part 2 of this review)."
32082073,Remifentanil Protects against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation through PARP-1/NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway.,2019,"Sepsis is a leading cause of death in patients with severe infection worldwide. Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting, potent opioid analgesic. In the study, we aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of remifentanil in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced inflammation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). HAECs were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or remifentanil (2.5 muM) for 30 min, then stimulated by LPS (10 mug/ml) for another 24 h. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) was inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Superoxide anion production and DNA damage were analyzed by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and comet assay. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-kappaB p65) expressions were analyzed by RT-PCR or western blotting analysis. NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation was assessed by immunofluorescence. Compared with the control group, pretreatment with remifentanil significantly reduced superoxide anion production and DNA damage, with downregulation of iNOS, ICAM-1, and PARP-1 expressions as well as PAR expression. Moreover, pretreatment with PARP-1 siRNA or remifentanil inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB p65 expression and nuclear translocation. Remifentanil reduced LPS-induced inflammatory response through PARP-1/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Remifentanil might be an optimal choice of analgesia in septic patients."
41583950,"Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of Interleukin-6, C-reactive Protein, and Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells(-1), Individually and Combined, in Differentiating Candidemia from Bacteremia in Intensive Care Unit Patients.",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Differentiating candidemia from bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is critical for effective treatment but is often delayed by reliance on conventional diagnostics like blood cultures. This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells(-1) (sTREM-1), individually and in combination, for distinguishing these bloodstream infections (BSIs). METHODS: This prospective observational study included 74 ICU patients with BSIs admitted to a university-affiliated hospital between September 2023 and August 2024. Biomarker levels were measured on the 2(nd) day of ICU admission. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients, 54 (72.9%) had bacteremia and 20 (27.1%) had candidemia. IL-6 and sTREM-1 levels were significantly higher in candidemia (P < 0.001), whereas CRP alone did not show discriminatory power (P = 0.981). The combined biomarker model achieved an area under the curve of 0.818, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance compared to individual markers. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and sTREM-1 are effective biomarkers for distinguishing candidemia from bacteremia, with CRP providing additional value in a multibiomarker model. This approach may enhance diagnostic precision and improve clinical decision-making in ICU settings."
19959497,Anesthesia and the microcirculation.,2009,"There is increasing evidence that the microcirculation and its regulation are severely compromised during many pathological conditions, such as hemorrhage, sepsis, or trauma. The effects of anesthetic agents on macrohemodynamics were investigated intensively in the last several decades. Research regarding modern anesthetics and anesthesia techniques has increased knowledge regarding the nonanesthetic effects of anesthetic agents, including those on organ perfusion and the microcirculation. Alterations in microvascular reactivity, nitric oxide pathways, and cytokine release are presumably the main mechanisms of anesthetic-induced tissue perfusion changes. This review summarizes current methods of microcirculatory status assessment and current knowledge regarding the microcirculatory effects of intravenous and potent volatile anesthetics and anesthesia-related techniques under both normal and pathophysiological conditions."

A patient with chronic renal failure developed a fungemia during the treatment of a dialysis-associated bacteremia. Cryptococcus neoformans grew in the catheter tip and blood culture. We addressed questions about this catheter-related fungemia.
20062763,"A female presenting with prolonged fever, weakness, and pain in the bilateral pelvic region: a case report.",2009,"INTRODUCTION: Psoas abscess, a collection of pus in the iliopsoas compartment that has traditionally been classified as primary and secondary according to its origin. CASE PRESENTATION: 48-year-old Turkish female presented to the department with fever, weakness and pain in the bilateral pelvic region. In contrast abdominal magnetic resonance, a collection compatible with the hyperintense abscess was observed in the right and left ilipsoas muscles. It was decided to simultaneously drain both abscesses of the case who had been using oral and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics for two months. No factors were detected in the microbiological reviews made on the abscess fluid of the operated case. The case was also examined in terms of tuberculosis and Crohn's disease and no findings were encountered to rise suspicions of such diseases. CONCLUSION: An abscess of the psoas muscle was a rare entity. However, with the increased use of computed tomography scans to evaluate patients with unknown foci of sepsis, psoas abscesses now are diagnosed and reported more frequently. What should be done after diagnosis are, if possible, defining the infection factor, selecting the appropriate antibiotics and draining the abscess openly or percutaneously."
19997984,Surgery for small bowel perforation in an Asian population: predictors of morbidity and mortality.,2010,"INTRODUCTION: Peritonitis from small bowel perforation is associated with prohibitive morbidity and mortality rates. The aims of our study were to review our institution's experience in the surgical management of small bowel perforation and to identify factors that could predict morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent operative intervention for peritonitis from small bowel perforation from January 2003 to May 2008 was performed. Patients were identified from the hospital's diagnostic index and operating records. The severity of abdominal sepsis for all patients was graded using the Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI). All the complications were graded according to the classification proposed by Clavien and group. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients, of median age 68 years (18-95 years), formed the study group. Pneumoperitoneum on chest radiographs was seen in only 11 (23.4%) patients. Foreign body ingestion (17.0%), adhesions (14.9%), and malignancy (12.8%) accounted for majority of the pathologies. There was one patient who had several small bowel perforations from Degos disease. Small bowel resection was performed in the majority of the patients (74.5%). The mortality rate in our series was 19.1%, while another 57.4% patients had perioperative complications. On univariate analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologists score >or= 3, MPI > 26, hypotension, stoma creation, abnormal electrolyte level, and renal impairment were related to worse outcome, while the three independent variables that were related to worse outcome after multivariate analysis were MPI > 26, hypotension, and abnormal serum potassium level. CONCLUSION: Surgery for small bowel perforation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Patients with more severe peritonitis and physiological derangement were more likely to fare worse."
20069124,Severe lactic acidosis in a patient with B-cell lymphoma: a case report and review of the literature.,2009,"Lactic acidosis is commonly observed in clinical situations such as shock and sepsis, as a result of tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Lymphoma and leukemia are among other clinical situations where lactic acidosis has been reported. We present a case of a 59-year-old female with lactic acidosis who was found to have aggressive B-cell lymphoma. There have been 29 cases of lymphoma induced lactic acidosis reported thus far; however all reported cases have abnormal vital signs or concomitant medical conditions that may lead to lactic acidosis. The pathogenesis of malignancy-induced lactic acidosis is not well understood; however associated factors include increased glycolysis, increased lactate production by cancer cells, and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. When it occurs, lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic sign in these patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of underlying lymphoma or leukemia remains the only way to achieve complete resolution of lactic acidosis in these patients."

18470711,Procalcitonin (PCT) is useful in predicting the bacterial origin of an acute circulatory failure in critically ill patients.,2000,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) in predicting bacterial infection in ICU medical and surgical patients. SETTING: A 10-bed medical surgical unit. DESIGN: PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) dosages were sampled in four groups of patients: septic shock patients (SS group), shock without infection (NSS group), patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome related to a proven bacterial infection (infect. group) and ICU patients without shock and without bacterial infection (control group). RESULTS: Sixty patients were studied (SS group:n=16, NSS group,n=18, infect. group,n=16, control group,n=10). The PCT level was higher in patients with proven bacterial infection (72+/-153 ng/ml vs 2.9+/-10 ng/ml,p=0.0003). In patients with shock, PCT was higher when bacterial infection was diagnosed (89 ng/ml+/-154 vs 4.6 ng/ml+/-12,p=0.0004). Moreover, PCT was correlated with severity (SAPS:p=0.00005, appearance of shock:p=0.0006) and outcome (dead: 71.3 g/ml, alive: 24.0 g/ml,p=0.006). CRP was correlated with bacterial infection (p<10(-5)) but neither with SAPS nor with day 28 mortality. IL-6 was correlated with neither infection nor day 28 mortality but was correlated with SAPS. Temperature and white blood cell count were unable to distinguish shocked patients with or without infection. Finally, when CRP and PCT levels were introduced simultaneously in a stepwise logistic regression model, PCT remained the unique marker of infection in patients with shock (PCT> or =5 ng/ml, OR: 6.2, 95% CI: 1.1-37,p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The increase of PCT is related to the appearance and severity of bacterial infection in ICU patients. Thus, PCT might be an interesting parameter for the diagnosis of bacterial infections in ICU patients."
25549485,[Therapy with high-doses of antithrombin III in patients with septic shock and agranulocytosis].,2014,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess efficacy of high-doses ofantithrombin 111 (AT) for treatment of septic shock in patients with an agranulocytosis. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. PATIENTS: 29 patients from 18 to 74 years old, with blood diseases complicated with septic shock Dates of study: from 2006 to 2012. METHODS: The patients were randomized into two groups. Group-1 included 14 patients, who did not receive AT and group-2 included 15 patients who received AT. RESULTS: Demographic indicators, condition severity according to APACHE II, level of thrombocytopenia, levels ofplasma procalcitonin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the same in both groups. Level of AT was decreased in both groups; however it was higher in the group-1 (50% vs. 60%, p < 0.05). In the group-1, microorganisms were found in the blood of 9 patients. In the group-2, the microorganisms were found in the blood of 11 patients. Inflammation markers were decreased after the treatment of septic shock in both groups (p<0.05). The decreasing of procalcitonin in group-1 was from 43.8 to 1 ng/ml in 14 days and from 12.8 to 1.6 ng/ml in 7 days in group-2. The decreasing of CRP in group-1 was from 224 to 114 mg/l in 7 days and from 146 to 60 mg/l in 14 days in group-2. The decreasing of IL-6 in group-1 was from 1617 to 100 pg/ml in 3 days and from 5895 to 77 pg/ml in 7 days in group-2. A level of AT was increased only in group-2 (under 12% per day). 28-day survival was higher in group-2 (60 +/- 13% vs. 45 +/- 13%, p<0.05). We did not find any complications of the treatment with AT concentrate. CONCLUSION: Treatment of septic shock with high-doses of antithrombin III was effective and safe in patients with an agranulocytosis."
25695243,[Evaluation of the diagnostic utility scale of NOSEP-1 and NOSEP-1 modified in suspected nosocomial sepsis in preterm infants].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial sepsis in premature neonates entertains a high rate of mortality. Diagnosis and timely treatment increase the therapeutic response. The nosocomial sepsis neonate prediction (NOSEP-1) scale has been utilized to evaluate neonatal sepsis; this scale required modifications to improve its sensitivity and specificity (NOSEP-1 modified). OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic usefulness of the NOSEP-1 and NOSEP-1 modified scales when nosocomial sepsis is suspected in premature neonates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Evaluation of the diagnostic test in premature neonates with data suggestive of sepsis. The gold standard was the hemoculture and the following diagnostic tests: nosocomial sepsis neonate prediction (NOSEP-1), with the following five items, including C-reactive protein (CRP); neutrophils; platelets; evaluation of the 24-h parenteral nutrition test, and fever, while NOSEP-1 modified substitutes fever with thermal stability and days on parenteral nutrition are reduced from 14 to 3 days. Precision, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The Fagan nomogram determined diagnostic usefulness. We employed the SSPS ver. 20 statistical software Packaged and statistical significance of p < 0.05. RESULTS: We studied 77 premature neonates, with application of the gold standard and the diagnostic test. There were 36 (47%) positive hemocultures. NOSEP-1, > 9 in sepsis 24 (67%), without sepsis 15 (36%) (p = 0.012). NOSEP-1 modified, > 9 in sepsis 35 (97%), without sepsis 35 (88%) (p = 0.113). NOSEP-1: sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 63%; positive pressure volume (PPV), 61%; negative pressure volume (NPV), 68%; positive pressure rate (RPP), 1.82, and negative pressure rate (RPN), 1.14. NOSEP-1 modified scale: sensitivity 97%; specificity 14%; positive pressure value (PPV), 50%; negative pressure value (NPV), 85%; positive probability ratio (PPR), 0.53, and negative probability ratio (NPR), 0.19. Diagnostic usefulness: NOSEP-1, 64%, and NOSEP-1 Modified, 53%. CONCLUSIONS: The NOSEP-1 and the modified NOSEP-1 scales have limited usefulness for diagnosing nosocomial sepsis in premature neonates."
32029029,[Elevated plasma histone is an independent risk factor for the development of septic cardiomyopathy].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and independent risk factors of septic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted. Patients with sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) of Subei People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, Yangzhou University, Fuxing Hospital, Capital Medical University and Beijing Electric Power Hospital from May 2016 to August 2019 were enrolled. All patients received standardized treatments according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines. Blood were collected within 24 hours of admission to ICU, and plasma histone H4, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to record the ultrasonic parameters within 24 hours after admission. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, usage of vasopressor drugs, and the prognosis of ICU were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether cardiomyopathy occurred or not, and the differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The correlation between plasma histone H4 and SOFA score, cTnI, NT-proBNP were investigated. Multivariate binary Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors for septic cardiomyopathy. The predictive value of histone H4 in septic cardiomyopathy was shown by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: 121 patients were included in this study, and there were 60 patients (49.6%) with septic cardiomyopathy. Thirty-six patients died, with an ICU mortality of 29.8%. (1) Correlation analysis showed that plasma histone H4 in patients with septic cardiomyopathy was positively correlated with cTnI, SOFA score and NT-proBNP (r value was 0.512, 0.403 and 0.274, respectively, all P < 0.01). (2) Compared with the non-cardiomyopathy group, the plasma histone H4, cTnI, usage of vasopressor drugs, SOFA score and ICU mortality in the cardiomyopathy group were significantly increased [histone H4 (mg/L): 0.26 (0.23, 0.30) vs. 0.22 (0.17, 0.27), cTnI (mug/L): 0.21 (0.17, 0.30) vs. 0.18 (0.14, 0.22), usage of vasopressor drugs: 83.3% (50/60) vs. 65.6% (40/61), SOFA score: 11 (9, 12) vs. 9 (8, 10), ICU mortality: 40.0% (24/60) vs. 19.7% (12/61), all P < 0.05]. Multivariate binary Logistic regression analysis showed that high histone H4 level [odds ratio (OR) = 6.502, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.203-78.231, P = 0.044] and usage of vasopressor drugs (OR = 2.622, 95%CI was 1.034-6.849, P = 0.042) were independent risk factors for septic cardiomyopathy. (4) ROC curve analysis showed the cut-off of histones H4 for predicting septic cardiomyopathy was 0.24 mg/L, the area under the curve was 0.684 (P < 0.01), with the sensitivity of 65.2%, and specificity of 68.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Septic cardiomyopathy had a high incidence. Higher plasma histone H4 and the usage of vasopressor drugs were independent risk factors for septic cardiomyopathy."
15652447,Circulating levels of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor and of IL-18 in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,2005,"Circulating levels of sIL-4R, IL-18 and IFN-gamma were studied by ELISA in 36 Gabonese patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria (29 children, 7 adults). Drug induced clearance of parasitemia, studied in 22 patients with mild disease, was accompanied by a rapid decrease of sIL-4R and IFN-gamma to normal values and an increase of circulating IL-18, suggesting the downregulation of a type 2 biased immune response and a dissociated type 1 responsiveness while resolving parasitemia. Comparing subgroups with hyperparasitemia/severe anemia and mild malaria, children with severe malaria had significant higher levels of sIL-4R and IFN-gamma, whereas IL-18 levels were not statistically different. Furthermore, among those children, higher levels of circulating IL-18 correlated with a lower degree of parasitemia."
31844297,Rapid MinION profiling of preterm microbiota and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.,2020,"The MinION sequencing platform offers near real-time analysis of DNA sequence; this makes the tool attractive for deployment in fieldwork or clinical settings. We used the MinION platform coupled to the NanoOK RT software package to perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing and profile mock communities and faecal samples from healthy and ill preterm infants. Using Nanopore data, we reliably classified a 20-species mock community and captured the diversity of the immature gut microbiota over time and in response to interventions such as probiotic supplementation, antibiotic treatment or episodes of suspected sepsis. We also performed rapid real-time runs to assess gut-associated microbial communities in critically ill and healthy infants, facilitated by NanoOK RT software package, which analysed sequences as they were generated. Our pipeline reliably identified pathogenic bacteria (that is, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance gene profiles within as little as 1 h of sequencing. Results were confirmed using pathogen isolation, whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing, as well as mock communities and clinical samples with known antimicrobial resistance genes. Our results demonstrate that MinION (including cost-effective Flongle flow cells) with NanoOK RT can process metagenomic samples to a rich dataset in < 5 h, which creates a platform for future studies aimed at developing these tools and approaches in clinical settings with a focus on providing tailored patient antimicrobial treatment options."
15779589,A very rare and rapidly fatal case of Chromobacterium violaceum septicemia.,2004,"Chromobacterium violaceum infection is rare but causes a high mortality rate particularly in immunosuppressed persons. Since its clinical presentation is non-specific and the diagnosis basically relies upon blood culture and sensitivity, this infection should be considered among the organisms targeted empirically for antibiotic therapy when a cellulitis or rapidly progressive illness follows exposure to water or soil. This is a case of fulminant septicemia caused by this rarely encountered organism."
41529006,Predictive value of blood gas parameters and hematologic indices on survival in critically ill sepsis patients.,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an excessive immune response to infection, leading to severe tissue and organ damage. In resource-limited settings, early, low-cost, and readily available laboratory parameters may guide outcome prediction. This study aimed to evaluate the role of hematological indices and laboratory parameters in predicting mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study included adult sepsis patients admitted to the ICU between January 2018 and December 2023. Blood samples obtained within the first 6 hours of ICU admission were processed using standardized analyzers. Demographic data, laboratory results at admission, length of hospital stay, and mortality status were retrieved from the hospital database. Associations between hematological indices, laboratory parameters, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were included; 40 died during hospitalization. No significant association was found between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), or platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mortality (NLR: p = 0.834, LMR: p = 0.895, PLR: p = 0.192). In contrast, pH levels showed a strong negative correlation with mortality (p < 0.001), while lactate levels were significantly positively correlated (p = 0.006). Carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels were not significantly related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Low pH and high lactate levels were the strongest predictors of mortality in sepsis patients, highlighting the prognostic value of simple blood gas parameters, especially where advanced diagnostics are limited. Hematological indices showed no significant association with mortality. pH and lactate should be prioritized in clinical decision-making for sepsis patients."
20062765,Anastomotic leak management after a low anterior resection leading to recurrent abdominal compartment syndrome: a case report and review of the literature.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Low anterior resection is usually the procedure of choice for rectal cancer, but a series of complications often accompany this procedure. This case report describes successful management of an intricate anastomotic leak after a low anterior resection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with a low rectal adenocarcinoma. He underwent a low anterior resection but subsequently developed fecal peritonitis due to an anastomotic leak. He was operated on again but developed abdominal compartment syndrome, multi-organ failure and sepsis. He was aggressively treated in the intensive care unit and in the operating room. Overall, the patient underwent four laparotomies and stayed in the intensive care unit for 75 days. He was discharged after 3 months of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Abdominal compartment syndrome may present as a devastating complication of damage control laparotomy. Prompt recognition and goal-directed management are the cornerstones of treatment."
41444533,Identification of potential characteristic genes in sepsis utilizing RNA sequencing and gene silence.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a serious condition involving organ dysfunction that can be life-threatening, posing a significant threat to human health. The mortality rate associated with sepsis ranges from 10% to 40%, with severe cases or those involving septic shock exhibiting mortality rates exceeding 50%. OBJECTIVE: Gene sequencing took place on the blood samples that were collected both healthy volunteers and septic patients in this study. Advanced methodologies, including bioinformatics analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), meta-analysis, and single-cell localization analysis, were employed to identify potential biomarkers associated with the immunomodulation of sepsis. The identified molecular markers were further validated through the establishment of a sepsis cell model, gene silence techniques, and an ELISA test experiments to assess inflammatory factors. METHODS: In this study, 23 individuals with sepsis and 10 healthy volunteers as controls, and peripheral blood samples were collected. The blood specimens were processed with the assistance of BGI for comprehensive gene sequencing. Post-sequencing, the data underwent quality control measures and were subsequently analyzed using the online platform iDEP 2.01 ( http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/ ) to identify differentially expressed genes. Conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses on the identified differentially expressed genes.To elucidate core genes from multiple perspectives, a PPI network was created with the help of the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/),facilitatin g the examination of gene interactions in terms of protein. Following the recognition of core genes, sepsis-associated data sets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database. Specifically, the transcriptional expression of the gene S100A11 was analyzed using meta-analysis techniques, and its survival curve was subsequently evaluated.The S100A11 gene, identified through screening, was analyzed using an online visualization system to determine its single-cell localization. Initial findings indicated that the gene is predominantly expressed in macrophages. (THP-1 cells) are known as a human monocytic cell line utilized in studies.We cultured THP-1 cells and differentiated into macrophages, followed by stimulation and transfection with the S100A11 gene. The interference effect of S100A11 was assessed using quantitative fluorescence PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, THP-1 cells were cultured to establish a septic cell model, and S100A11 gene silence experiments were conducted, categorizing the samples into control, sepsis, and gene silence sepsis groups. ELISA was employed to assess the concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that S100A11 is highly expressed in sepsis and is primarily localized in macrophages. The enrichment in signaling pathways, including Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, was uncovered by differential gene expression analysis.S100A11 serves as a critical regulatory node for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Notably, S100A11 was found to be highly expressed in patients with sepsis. This gene plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation during the septic inflammatory response and may be involved in macrophage differentiation, immunomodulation, and the inflammatory processes associated with sepsis."
19956923,"Angiopoietin-2 in patients requiring renal replacement therapy in the ICU: relation to acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and outcome.",2010,"PURPOSE: Endothelial activation has emerged as an early event in the pathogenesis of microcirculatory dysfunction, capillary leakage and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a circulating antagonistic ligand of the endothelial-specific Tie2 receptor, has been identified as a non-redundant gatekeeper of endothelial activation. On the basis of our previous report demonstrating release of Ang-2 in endotoxemia and sepsis, we aimed to study the utility of Ang-2 to serve as an outcome-specific biomarker in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We measured circulating Ang-2 by ELISA in 117 critically ill patients with AKI at inception of RRT in the ICU. Mortality, length of stay and renal recovery were prospectively assessed during a study period of 28 days after the inception of RRT. RESULTS: Circulating Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in AKI patients with RIFLE category-Injury or -Failure, compared to patients with RIFLE category-Risk. Elevated levels of circulating Ang-2 correlated with impaired oxygenation, low mean arterial pressure, vasopressor dose and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Ang-2 concentrations were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at day 0 and day 14 after initiation of RRT. Multivariate Cox regression and decision tree analyses confirmed a strong independent prognostic impact of elevated Ang-2 as a predictor of 28-day survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicate that circulating Ang-2 is as a strong and independent predictor of mortality in ICU patients with dialysis-dependent AKI."
41462719,"Predictive Value of CRIB II Score, Hematological Markers and Maternal-Fetal Risk Factors for Mortality in Neonatal Sepsis.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Accurate early prediction of mortality is essential to improve clinical outcomes. The Clinical Risk Index for Babies II (CRIB II) and hematological indices such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have emerged as potential prognostic tools, but their performance in septic neonates has not been fully established. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 80 neonates diagnosed with sepsis at a tertiary referral hospital. Demographic, maternal, and laboratory data-including CRIB II, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), PLR, mean platelet volume (MPV), and red-cell distribution width (RDW)-were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine optimal cutoff values, and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Among the 80 neonates, 40 (50%) did not survive. Non-survivors had significantly higher CRIB II scores (median 5.0 [1.0-13.0]) than survivors (2.0 [0-7.0]) (p < 0.001). PLR and MPV were also elevated in non-survivors (PLR: 88.5 vs. 51.8, p < 0.001; MPV: 10.5 vs. 9.5, p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for mortality: CRIB II (AUC = 0.835; cutoff > 3.5; sensitivity 82.5%; specificity 78.0%) and PLR (AUC = 0.757; cutoff > 81.33; sensitivity 80.0%; specificity 70.0%). Multivariate analysis confirmed three independent predictors-PROM > 24 h (OR = 12.23; 95% CI: 2.05-73.11), PLR > 81.33 (OR = 91.02; 95% CI: 7.00-1184.29), and CRIB II > 3.5 (OR = 101.37; 95% CI: 4.50-2284.47). CONCLUSIONS: CRIB II and PLR are reliable, independent predictors of mortality in neonatal sepsis. Their integration with maternal factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes may improve early risk stratification and guide targeted interventions, particularly in resource-limited neonatal care settings."

15648982,The use of real time rtPCR to quantify inflammatory mediator expression in leukocytes from patients with severe sepsis.,2004,"Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT rtPCR) was used to quantify the pattern of inflammatory mediator mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes from adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis. We analysed 29 blood samples from 26 severely septic patients with different septic sources and eight samples from eight healthy adult volunteers. RT rtPCR was used to quantify mRNA expression of 21 different inflammatory mediators in peripheral leukocytes. The median variability in gene expression in the sepsis patients was 10.5 times greater than the variability of the healthy comparison group. We found a significant change in the regulation for the following genes: C5aR (20-fold, P < 0.001), IL-8 (29-fold, P < 0.001), MMP9 (72-fold, P < 0.001), HSP70 (2.4-fold, P = 0.02), and RIP2 (1.8-fold, P < 0.04) were up-regulated. Conversely the median expression of IFNgamma, and IL-6 were zero (P < 0.001), and mtHSP (0.4-fold, P = 0.02) was significantly down-regulated. Using linear discriminant analysis, IFNgamma, IL-12, and TLR4 were correlated to a negative outcome. Different septic sources (peritonitis, burn, pneumonia and musculo-skeletal infections) resulted in significantly different mRNA patterns. The RT rtPCR is a useful tool to monitor the immune response in septic patients. We found a very high variability in inflammatory mediator expression among septic patients compared to healthy volunteers. This suggests that any future immune-modulatory therapy may need to be individualized to the patient's requirements as monitored by RT rtPCR. Different sources of sepsis may result in markedly different activation patterns."
20042206,[Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Neuroradiological findings].,2010,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HL) is a rare syndrome, although more common in children, that may be underdiagnosed. The clinical presentation can be aggressive, and patients may rapidly develop lethal multiple organ failure....HL simulates the presentation of infectious sepsis, although the response to treatment and evolution are worse. HL should be suspected in young children with persistent fever of unknown origin, general malaise, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, elevated triglycerides and ferritin, and decreased fibrinogen. Brain MRI shows diffuse leptomeningeal and perivascular enhancement, patchy areas of hyperintensity in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres on T2-weighted sequences, and cerebral atrophy. Diffusion-weighted sequences are useful for staging the lesions. We present a fatal case of familial HL and review the literature about the clinical, histological, and radiological characteristics of this disease."
20005762,The efficacy of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin in the prevention of catheter-related bacteremia in cancer patients receiving high-dose interleukin-2.,2010,"High-dose interleukin-2 (HDIL-2) has proven to be an effective treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Previous studies have shown an increase in catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) in patients on HDIL-2. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of minocycline and rifampin-coated catheters (M/R-C) in reducing CRB in cancer patients on HDIL-2. This was a retrospective study where non-coated catheters (NC-C) and M/R-C were used for the administration of HDIL-2 before and after December 2004, respectively. Data collected included demographics, cancer type, catheter type, antibiotic prophylaxis, and infection rates. A total of 107 episodes of catheter use for HDIL-2 were evaluated in 78 patients (30 episodes in patients with M/R-C vs. 77 with NC-C). A total of nine episodes of CRB were identified, all in patients with NC-C (M/R-C 0% vs. NC-C 12%; p=0.06). The median time to bacteremia was 11 days (range 1-315 days). A log-rank test showed a trend that the M/R-C group had lower probability of getting CRB than the NC-C group (p=0.06). The use of M/R-C in patients on HDIL-2 therapy for advanced melanoma and renal cell carcinoma may have reduced the risk of CRB to nil. CRB still occurred despite antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with NC-C."
20006331,Thrombopoietin contributes to enhanced platelet activation in cigarette smokers.,2010,"OBJECTIVES: Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a humoral growth factor that primes platelet activation in response to several agonists. We recently showed that TPO enhances platelet activation in unstable angina and sepsis. Aim of this study was to investigate the role of TPO in platelet function abnormalities described in cigarette smokers. METHODS: In a case-control study we enrolled 20 healthy cigarette smokers and 20 nonsmokers, and measured TPO and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as platelet-leukocyte binding and P-selectin expression. In vitro we evaluated the priming activity of smoker or control plasma on platelet activation, and the role of TPO in this effect. We then studied the effects of acute smoking and smoking cessation on TPO levels and platelet activation indices. RESULTS: Chronic cigarette smokers had higher circulating TPO levels than nonsmoking controls, as well as increased platelet-leukocyte binding, P-selectin expression, and CRP levels. Serum cotinine concentrations correlated with TPO concentrations, platelet-monocyte aggregates and P-selectin expression. In addition, TPO levels significantly correlated with ex vivo platelet-monocyte aggregation and P-selectin expression. In vitro, the plasma from cigarette smokers, but not from nonsmoking controls, primed platelet-monocyte binding, which was reduced when an inhibitor of TPO was used. We also found that acute smoking slightly increased TPO levels, but did not affect platelet-leukocyte binding, whereas smoking cessation induced a significant decrease in both circulating TPO and platelet-leukocyte aggregation. CONCLUSION: Elevated TPO contributes to enhance platelet activation and platelet-monocyte cross-talk in cigarette smokers."
31896446,"Muscle degradation, vitamin D and systemic inflammation in hospitalized septic patients.",2020,"PURPOSE: To date, the relationship between systemic inflammation and muscle changes observed by ultrasonography in septic patients in clinical studies is not known. Furthermore, the role of vitamin D on muscle changes in these patients needs to be investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis or septic shock. Blood samples were collected to evaluate systemic inflammation (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha)) and vitamin D. Muscle mass was evaluated by ultrasound during hospitalization. Clinical tests of muscle strength (Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and handgrip) were performed after the awakening of patients. RESULTS: There was a reduction in day 2 values to hospital discharge on TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-10 (p < .05). The muscle mass showed a significant decline from day 6 of the ICU. After awakening, the patients had a significant increase in muscle strength (p < .05). There was a positive association between muscle mass variation (day 2 - ICU) with absolute values of IL-8 (r = 0.38 p = .05). For muscle strength, there was a negative association between handgrip strength with IL-8 (r = -0.36 p < .05) on ICU discharge. The vitamin D showed a positive association with the handgrip strength of the day 1 of the awakening (r = 0.51 p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients, there is an association between inflammation and changes in muscle mass and strength during ICU stay, which is similar to those observed in experimental studies. In addition, there was an association of vitamin D with recovery of muscle strength during hospitalization."
25575850,N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I for the prognostic utility in elderly patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in intensive care unit: A retrospective study.,2015,"BACKGROUNDS: Using biomarkers to predict mortality in patient with severe sepsis or septic shock is of importance, as these patients frequently have high mortality and unsatisfied outcome. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) play extremely important roles in prognostic value in the mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock. AIMS: The present study was retrospectively designed to evaluate the predicting mortality of NT-proBNP and cTnI in elderly patients with severe sepsis or septic shock administered in the intensive care unit (ICU) and also to evaluate whether the predicting ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score or C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased in combination with the biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 430 patients (aged >/=65 years) with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to our ICU between October 2011 and December 2013 was included in the study. Patient data including clinical, laboratory, and survival and mortality were collected. All patients were examined with NT-proBNP, cTnI, CRP, and APACHE-II score and were categorized as the survived and deceased groups according to the outcome 30 days after ICU treatment. RESULTS: The levels of NT-proBNP and cTnI (P < .01) or CRP (P < .05) were significantly higher in the deceased group than those in the survived group. The predicting mortality of APACHE-II score alone was low but largely improved, when it was combined with both NT-proBNP and cTnI (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The alteration of NT-proBNP and cTnI levels strongly predicated the ICU prognosis in elderly patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and cTnI were superior to CRP in predicting mortality. The predicting ability of APACHE-II score was improved only when combined with NT-proBNP and cTnI."
41417946,Lipid peroxidation-induced neurocardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients with septic shock.,2025,"CONTEXT: Septic shock's fatal signs include hemodynamic collapse, systemic inflammation, and organ failure. Neurocardiac dysfunctions worsen outcomes, with lipid peroxidation from oxidative stress as a key damage mechanism. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study is to investigates how lipid peroxidation in cell membranes generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial damage, cell death, and autonomic dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), toxic byproducts, contribute to cardiomyocyte injury, endothelial damage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and altered neuronal signalling. The research analyzes preclinical and clinical data associating sepsis oxidative indicators with poorer cardiac and neurological outcomes. Results: chronological relationship between oxidative stress, cardiac damage, and neural injury. While the visualisation highlights elevated biomarker levels in critically ill neurocardiac patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, risk classification, and focused treatment for septic shock may benefit from understanding neurocardiac dysfunction and lipid peroxidation."
25631595,"Enterobacteriaceae Sepsis Outcome Programme annual report, 2013.",2014,"The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric Gram-negative pathogens. The 2013 survey focussed for the first time on blood stream infections. Four thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight Enterobacteriaceae species were tested using commercial automated methods (Vitek(R) 2, BioMerieux; Phoenix, BD). The results were analysed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (January 2014). Of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 7.5%/7.5% (CLSI/EUCAST criteria respectively) of Escherichia coli; 6.3%/6.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 7.4%/7.4% of K. oxytoca. Non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 10.3%/11.3% for E. coli, 4.6%/7.5% for K. pneumoniae, 0.6%/0.6% for K. oxytoca, and 3.6%/6.1% in Enterobacter cloacae. Resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 3.1%/6.2%, 4.2%/7.0%, 11.9% /12.6%, and 17.3% /22.2% for the same 4 species respectively. Fourteen isolates were shown to harbour a carbapenemase gene, 9 blaIMP, 3 blaKPC, and 2 blaNDM."
19944229,Pyomyositis in children: early diagnosis and treatment.,2009,"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate early diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment outcome in children with pyomyositis. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2006, 6 children with a mean age of 7.2 years were diagnosed and treated for pyomyositis in our clinic. The most common site of involvement was the hip and thigh region. All patients underwent early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination that played a significant role in the early diagnosis and management of the disease. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen and was identified in 3 cases. Intravenous antibiotics were administered and were followed by oral agents for an additional period. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 6 weeks. No surgical intervention was needed. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate response to the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although pyomyositis is a rare disease, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of immediate onset of musculoskeletal pain in children. Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are important as major complications such as abscess formation and sepsis can be avoided. Having a high sensitivity to reactive inflammatory changes, MRI is a valuable tool in the armamentarium of the clinician in early diagnosis of pyomyositis."
19955274,Detection and identification of Ehrlichia species in blood by use of PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.,2010,"Rapid detection and identification of Ehrlichia species improves clinical outcome for patients suspected of ehrlichiosis. We describe an assay that employs multilocus PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to detect and identify Ehrlichia species directly from blood specimens. The results were compared to those of a colorimetric microtiter PCR enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) used as a diagnostic assay. Among 213 whole-blood samples collected from patients who were clinically suspected of ehrlichiosis from 1 May to 1 August 2008 at Vanderbilt University Hospital, 40 were positive for an Ehrlichia species by PCR/ESI-MS, giving a positive rate of 18.8%. In comparison to the PCR-EIA, PCR/ESI-MS possessed a sensitivity, a specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 95.0%, 98.8%, 95.0%, and 98.8%, respectively. The 38 specimens that were positive for Ehrlichia by both PCR/ESI-MS and the PCR-EIA were further characterized to the species level, with 100% agreement between the two assays. In addition, Rickettsia rickettsii was detected by PCR/ESI-MS from four specimens that were confirmed retrospectively by serology and PCR-EIA. In three specimens, the PCR/ESI-MS assay identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus; these were confirmed by culture and/or clinical diagnosis as being clinically relevant. From specimen processing to result reporting, the PCR/ESI-MS assay can be completed within 6 h, providing another laboratory tool for the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. Moreover, this system may provide rapid detection and identification of additional pathogens directly from blood specimens."
20036378,An exclusively human milk-based diet is associated with a lower rate of necrotizing enterocolitis than a diet of human milk and bovine milk-based products.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health benefits of an exclusively human milk-based diet compared with a diet of both human milk and bovine milk-based products in extremely premature infants. STUDY DESIGN: Infants fed their own mothers' milk were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups. Groups HM100 and HM40 received pasteurized donor human milk-based human milk fortifier when the enteral intake was 100 and 40 mL/kg/d, respectively, and both groups received pasteurized donor human milk if no mother's milk was available. Group BOV received bovine milk-based human milk fortifier when the enteral intake was 100 mL/kg/d and preterm formula if no mother's milk was available. Outcomes included duration of parenteral nutrition, morbidity, and growth. RESULTS: The 3 groups (total n = 207 infants) had similar baseline demographic variables, duration of parenteral nutrition, rates of late-onset sepsis, and growth. The groups receiving an exclusively human milk diet had significantly lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC; P = .02) and NEC requiring surgical intervention (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: For extremely premature infants, an exclusively human milk-based diet is associated with significantly lower rates of NEC and surgical NEC when compared with a mother's milk-based diet that also includes bovine milk-based products."
41562073,Impact of absolute lymphocyte count upon admission to ICU on 28-day mortality in sepsis patients in ICU.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with high mortality and poor prognosis in critically ill patients, posing a severe threat to global public health. The first absolute lymphocyte count (FALC) upon admission to the ICU, reflecting the initial state of the immune system, has emerged as a potential prognostic indicator in various critical illnesses. However, its specific role and predictive value in assessing 28-day mortality among sepsis patients in the ICU remain incompletely understood, with existing studies showing limitations in sample size and verification dimensions. METHODS: Data of ICU patients (18<age<90) who met the sepsis diagnostic criteria (Sepsis-3 definition) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV(2.0) clinical database. Patients were grouped according to the tertiles of FALC (low, medium, high); FALC was the absolute lymphocyte count in the first complete blood count upon admission to the ICU; the outcome indicator was 28-day all-cause mortality. Baseline analysis: For measurement data, normally distributed data were described as mean +/- standard deviation, skewed distributed data as median (Q1-Q3), and count data as frequency (percentage). Differences between groups were tested using t-test, chi-square test, or non-parametric test. Survival analysis: KM method was used to draw survival curves, and log-rank test was used to compare differences between groups; Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze univariate/multivariate associations, and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Non-linear verification: RCS model was used to fit the non-linear relationship between FALC and death risk, and the linear hypothesis was tested. PREDICTIVE EFFICACY: Cox regression ROC curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the predictive value of FALC. RESULTS: The study of 10,263 sepsis patients admitted to the ICU found that FALC grouping significantly affected 28-day survival outcomes, as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. Low FALC group having a significantly higher 28-day mortality risk compared to the medium and high groups. Restricted cubic splines verified a non-linear relationship between FALC and 28-days mortality, and the ROC curve confirmed that FALC has a certain prognostic predictive efficacy. CONCLUSION: In sepsis patients, lymphopenia represents a significant high-risk factor, while the first absolute lymphocyte count (FALC) stands out as a clinically meaningful indicator. It allows for precise risk stratification of patients at the time of ICU admission, thereby enabling timely immune interventions that can effectively enhance prognostic outcomes."
33345987,Effect of Antibiotic Treatment of Amniotic Fluid Sludge.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Amniotic fluid sludge refers to the sonographic presence of echogenic, free-floating aggregates of debris located within the amniotic cavity near the internal cervical os of women with intact membranes. Clinically, it is independently associated with increased obstetric, infectious, and neonatal morbidity, including: short cervix, chorioamnionitis, and an increased risk of preterm birth. It is thought to be infectious in nature and has been described as an intrauterine bacterial biofilm. There is little evidence on the impact of treatment with antibiotics on outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether outpatient antibiotics administered to women with amniotic fluid sludge would reduce preterm birth risk compared to no antibiotic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with amniotic fluid sludge by transvaginal sonography between 15 and 25 weeks' gestation in the outpatient ultrasound unit at a single academic center between 2010 and 2017. Patients were segregated according to whether they were treated with oral antibiotics at the time of diagnosis. Women with multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, preterm rupture of membranes prior to initial diagnosis of amniotic fluid sludge, and active preterm labor placenta previa and/or suspected accreta were excluded from analysis. Primary outcome of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation was compared by univariate and regression analysis to control for potential co-linear and/or confounding variables. Additional outcomes were compared by univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients were initially identified, and 97 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 51 were treated with oral antibiotics (46 azithromycin and 5 moxifloxacin), and 46 were not treated. The overall incidence of preterm birth at <37 weeks was 49.4 % (48 of 97) and preterm birth <28 weeks was 22.7% (22 of 97). There was no significant difference in preterm birth, either at <37 weeks (P = .47) or <28 weeks (P = .83) between the treated and untreated women. After adjusting for race, body mass index, tobacco use, cervical length, and preterm birth history, antibiotic treatment did not reduce the risk of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3; confidence interval, 0.77-1.9). No differences were seen in the incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes (P = .94) or median latency from diagnosis to delivery (P = .47). Birthweight (P = .99), sepsis (P = .53), intraventricular hemorrhage (P = .95), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (P = .08) were not affected by antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment did not affect the incidence of either clinical or histologic chorioamnionitis (P = .92 and .14, respectively) or histologic stage 2-3 maternal or fetal inflammation (P = .94 and 0.58, respectively). Sonographic resolution of amniotic fluid sludge on first subsequent scan was seen in 34% of antibiotic-treated women and 43% of untreated women (P = .42). There was no difference in latency from diagnosis to delivery or mean gestational age at delivery according to whether sludge resolved or persisted at the first subsequent scan (P = .14 for each). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic treatment of amniotic fluid sludge is not associated with a reduction in premature birth. Likewise, antibiotic treatment of amniotic fluid sludge was not associated with improvement in other obstetric, neonatal, or pathologic variables. These findings suggest that the presumed infectious nature of sludge and subsequent adverse outcomes are not treated or improved by administration of azithromycin following midtrimester sonographic diagnosis."
33094143,Incidence and outcome of group B streptococcal invasive disease in Omani infants.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection is a serious disease that continues to cause high morbidity and mortality. It is one of the leading cause of sepsis; particularly meningitis, in infants and young children all around the world. In this study, we aim to identify the incidence of GBS sepsis in Omani infants less than 3 months of age who were born at Royal Hospital and who presented with clinical sepsis and positive culture. In addition, we aim to describe the clinical presentation and complications noted on admission and then on follow-up visit. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective chart review study. It included all Omani infants (0-3 months) who were diagnosed to have GBS sepsis/meningitis from 2006 to 2016 at the Royal Hospital, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. RESULTS: There were 83,000 live births in the Royal Hospital over a period of 10 years. Thirty-eight babies had culture proven GBS infection, with an overall incidence rate of neonatal GBS of 0.46 per 1000 live births with 95% confidence intervals. There were no significant variations in the annual rates of infection during the study period, ranging from around 1-7 cases per year. Additional 5 cases of GBS sepsis presented to Royal Hospital are either through Emergency Department or as referrals from other hospitals, giving us a total of 43 cases of proven GBS infections. Out of the 43 cases, 8 were born prematurely (19%), either before (<34 weeks, n = 2) or during (34-36 weeks, n = 6). Term babies were 35 out of 43 with percentage of 81% of the total. Three died, resulting in a case mortality of 7.0%. CONCLUSION: Our GBS incidence is comparable to that of screened population internationally. At the time being, with the best available results, maternal screening might not seem cost effective in our current settings. A cost effective study is required before implemented a national screening programme in the Country. However, this research will definitely help in the process of any future plans of implantation of new guidelines, as it can be used as leading point for future prospective studies."
31858365,Expanding Clinical Phenotype and Novel Insights into the Pathogenesis of ICOS Deficiency.,2020,"BACKGROUND: Inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) deficiency has been categorized as a combined immunodeficiency often complicated by enteropathies, autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and malignancy. We report seven new patients and four novel ICOS mutations resulting in a common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-like phenotype and show that dysregulated IL-12 release, reduced cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) expression, and skewing towards a Th1-dominant phenotype are all associated with inflammatory complications in this condition. METHODS: A combination of whole exome and Sanger sequencing was used to identify novel mutations. Standard clinical and immunological evaluation was performed. FACS and ELISA-based assays were used to study cytokine responses and ICOS/ICOSL/CTLA4 expression following stimulation of whole blood and PBMCs with multiple TLR ligands, anti-CD3, and PHA. RESULTS: Four novel ICOS mutations included homozygous c.323_332del, homozygous c.451C>G, and compound heterozygous c.58+1G>A/c.356T>C. The predominant clinical phenotype was that of antibody deficiency associated with inflammatory complications in 4/7 patients. Six out of seven patients were treated with immunoglobulin replacement and one patient died from salmonella sepsis. All patients who were tested showed reduced IL-10 and IL-17 cytokine responses, normal IL-1beta, IL6, and TNF release following LPS stimulation and highly elevated IL-12 production in response to combined LPS/IFNgamma stimulation. This was associated with skewing of CD4(+) T cells towards Th1 phenotype and increased expression of ICOSL on monocytes. Lastly, reduced CTLA4 expression was found in 2 patients. One patient treated with ustekinumab for pancytopenia due to granulomatous bone marrow infiltration failed to respond to this targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ICOS deficiency is associated with defective T cell activation, with simultaneously enhanced stimulation of monocytes. The latter is likely to result from a lack of ICOS/ICOSL interaction which might be necessary to provide negative feedback which limits monocytes activation."
19931812,Gram-negative bloodstream infections.,2009,"Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) is both dangerous and challenging. The incidence of Gram-negative BSI rises with age in both men and women, but there are still some gender differences in terms of aetiology and acquisition. Clinical elements such as organ dysfunction are helpful in determining prognosis. During the last few years we have observed dramatic increases in resistance among Gram-negative organisms, including those causing bloodstream infections. Gram-negative pathogens producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are now common, and are associated with high rates of inadequate empirical treatment and mortality. In addition, carbapenem resistance is increasing, leaving clinicians with limited therapeutic options. Better knowledge of local epidemiology can help to optimize therapies. The use of cefepime has been questioned based on a recent meta-analysis showing increased mortality in patients treated with the drug. However, an analysis performed by the US Food and Drug Administration has not confirmed these results. Unfortunately, antimicrobial development has not kept pace with resistance, particularly for Gram-negative pathogens. We need therefore to better utilize current antibiotics and undertake rigorous infection control measures to prevent these life-threatening infections."
25755887,"Fatal Chromobacterium violaceum bacteraemia in rural Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.",2015,"We describe the first case of bacteraemia caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

41456707,Comprehensive management of infectious cellulitis:From epidemiology to hospital approach in Spain.,2026,"INTRODUCTION: Cellulitis is a skin and soft tissue infection caused by the entry of a microorganism into the subcutaneous tissue. Nowadays it represents one of the main causes of hospital admission, mainly due to incorrect diagnosis or the need for intravenous treatment. The aim of this study is to observe the characteristics of cellulitis in patients admitted to our hospital during two years in order to determine whether admissions were really necessary. METHODS: Retrospective study of admissions for cellulitis between 2022 and 2023 at the Salamanca University Hospital, classified according to the CREST-SEWS criteria. RESULTS: During the study period, 332 patients with cellulitis were admitted to the Salamanca University Hospital. 56% of the patients were classified as grade II (those who do not have severe symptoms, but who are usually admitted due to their comorbidities). 70% of the patients had some comorbidity or risk factor such as skin disorders, type II diabetes mellitus or heart failure. The most common site of infection was the lower extremities. The etiologic agent of the infection could be established in 28% of the patients, and the most frequently isolated microorganism was methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The most common treatment was beta-lactams, specifically amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (39.5%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (23.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In order to treat infectious cellulitis, it is essential to carry out a correct etiological diagnosis in order to establish the most appropriate treatment and reduce unnecessary admissions, especially in patients with class II cellulitis."
20301626,X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia.,1993,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections in affected males in the first two years of life. Recurrent otitis is the most common infection prior to diagnosis. Conjunctivitis, sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and skin infections are also frequently seen. Approximately 60% of individuals with XLA are recognized as having immunodeficiency when they develop a severe, life-threatening infection such as pneumonia, empyema, meningitis, sepsis, cellulitis, or septic arthritis. S pneumoniae and H influenzae are the most common organisms found prior to diagnosis and may continue to cause sinusitis and otitis after diagnosis and the initiation of gammaglobulin substitution therapy. Severe, difficult-to-treat enteroviral infections (often manifesting as dermatomyositis or chronic meningoencephalitis) can be prevented by this treatment. The prognosis for individuals with XLA has improved markedly in the last 25 years as a result of earlier diagnosis, the development of preparations of gammaglobulin that allow normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulin G to be achieved, and more liberal use of antibiotics. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of XLA is established in a male proband with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous BTK pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of XLA can be established in a female proband with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BTK identified by molecular genetic testing. Females with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BTK extremely rarely have clinical and laboratory findings of XLA. MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: The mainstay of treatment is gammaglobulin substitution therapy (by weekly subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion every two to four weeks) to prevent bacterial infections. Treatment of manifestations: Generous use of antibiotics can decrease the incidence of chronic sinusitis and lung disease. Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered to prevent infections. Vaccines, apart from live vaccines, are recommended to prevent infection. Inactivated polio vaccine (as opposed to live oral polio vaccine) should be given to affected individuals and their family contacts. Surveillance: Complete blood count with differential and quantitative serum immunoglobulins at least annually; chest and sinus imaging as needed to assess for chronic lung and/or sinus disease. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Live viral vaccines, particularly oral polio vaccine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk male relatives as soon after birth as possible ensures that gammaglobulin substitution therapy is initiated as soon as possible in affected individuals and administration of live viral vaccines can be avoided. GENETIC COUNSELING: By definition, XLA is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother: if the mother has a BTK pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the BTK pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and are highly unlikely to be affected. Affected males transmit the BTK pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the BTK pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."
41472015,Non-Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)-Related Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).,2025,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although traditionally viewed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), can also result from non-sexually transmitted microorganisms that display distinct epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Unlike STI-related PID, these infections are less influenced by sexual behavior, often show a bimodal age distribution, and are linked to bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated dysbiosis, iatrogenic uterine procedures, postpartum states, or inadequate access to timely screening and care. Non-STI-related PID is usually polymicrobial, predominantly involving BV-associated vaginal, enteric, or urinary commensals that ascend into the upper genital tract, while respiratory tract organisms, mycobacteria, and biofilm-associated pathogens may also play a role. Pathophysiological mechanisms include disruption of the endocervical barrier, mucus degradation, biofilm formation, hematogenous or iatrogenic seeding, and chronic cytokine-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic/subclinical disease to acute pelvic pain and tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and can progress to systemic infection and sepsis. Diagnosing non-STI PID is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, negative STI tests, and inconclusive imaging findings, while management relies on broad-spectrum antimicrobials with surgery as needed. Given these complexities, this review aims to synthesize current knowledge on non-STI-related PID, clarify key considerations for its diagnosis, management, and prevention, and outline future perspectives to improve clinical outcomes."
15577474,Prevention and treatment of dislocation after total hip replacement using large diameter balls.,2004,"The purpose of this study was to review safety and efficacy of total hip arthroplasty using large-diameter femoral heads in treatment and prevention of dislocation. One hundred forty hips in 135 patients were replaced using femoral heads at least 36 mm in diameter. The average age of the patients was 61.6 years. The patients were grouped into three categories depending on their diagnoses: recurrent dislocations from previous total hip replacements (Group 1; 29 hips); revision surgeries not including revisions for dislocations (Group 2; 54 hips); and primary surgeries (Group 3; 57 hips). The average followup was 5.5 years (range, 1-17 years). A total of 16 hips were revised: six for instability, four for fracture or disassociation of a conventional polyethylene liner, three for aseptic loosening of the socket, and three for sepsis. One hip from Group 1 dislocated at 12.5 years postoperatively, was treated with closed reduction, and since has been nonrecurring. UCLA hip scores all improved significantly. The prevalence of dislocation varied among the three groups, with 13.7% for Group 1, 1.8% for Group 2, and 3.5% for Group 3. The failure in the six cases that required revision for instability was attributable to poor socket orientation. All the hips became stable after revision without the use of a constrained acetabular liner. Large-diameter femoral heads provide additional stability not only for patients with recurrent dislocations, but also for patients having revision. The new, more wear-resistant bearings now enable the surgeon to extend the use of big femoral heads to primary total hip arthroplasty. Metal-on-metal seems to be the material of choice for a bone-conserving reconstruction with large femoral heads."
19931813,Risk factors and management of Gram-positive bacteraemia.,2009,"The incidence of Gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. The virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of S. aureus bloodstream infections. The rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant S. aureus carrying the Panton-Valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep gives cause for concern, and MICs >1 microg/mL are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with S. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. Daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for S. aureus bloodstream infections in settings with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Enterococci are the third leading cause of Gram-positive bacteraemia in our institution. Management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in Enterococcus faecium infections. The recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for Enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains."

33584055,Evaluation of the Variations in the Levels of Perioperative Inflammatory Markers After Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Maxillofacial Fractures.,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative infectious complications are commonly encountered in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of maxillofacial fractures. An early diagnosis of infectious processes is the key in preventing morbidity/mortality which could be in the form of loss of hardware and sepsis. To prevent these, various markers of inflammation have been studied in different disciplines of surgery but are found scarce in maxillofacial practice. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was designed to evaluate the perioperative variations in the levels of inflammatory markers. We analysed temperature, TLC, DLC, ALT, AST and CRP in 50 patients of ORIF. Their values were recorded preoperatively as well as at 24 h, 48 h, third day and seventh day postoperatively. The correlation of inflammatory markers with the type of anaesthesia and length of surgery were also analysed. RESULTS: The ranges of various markers in the perioperative phase were: temperature (97.6  masculineF-99.2  masculineF), TLC (5100/mm(3)-18200/mm(3)), neutrophils (51-91%), AST (12-86 IU/L), ALT (12-96 IU/L) and CRP (1.2-150 mg/L). Mean values of all the inflammatory markers achieved their peak values within 24 h postoperatively. These values showed a decline thereafter, with the day 3 and day 7 values being even lower than their preoperative values. This fall in the values was highly significant (p < 0.001) except ALT where the fall was significant (p < 0.05). The data obtained could be used as a reference range by the surgeons for monitoring the recovery of the patient. It could also help in timely interception and expeditious management of an infectious episode in the postoperative phase."
15660322,Intestinal transplantation for total/near-total aganglionosis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.,2004,"Whether from anatomical short gut (such as after resection of extensive intestinal aganglionosis) or from a functional cause (such as intestinal pseudoobstruction), intestinal failure is a devastating disease process with profound morbidity and mortality. These patients require total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and are at risk of developing complications such as liver failure, catheter-related sepsis and loss of venous access. Intestinal transplantation, which has advanced markedly over the last 14 years, is now the accepted standard of care for patients failing TPN. Survival outcomes have improved significantly, infectious complications are better controlled, and new immunosuppressive therapies offer great hope for the future. In particular, the results of intestinal transplantation achieved with the motility disorders are equivalent to those experienced with other causes of intestinal failure. In themselves, the motility disorders present their own set of complicating factors, including determining the extent of the disease process (which may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract), associated urological anomalies, and the type of organ transplantation required. Extensive workup and careful consideration is required before transplantation is undertaken. However, early referral is desirable once complications arise if these patients are to be offered optimal medical care before the chance of transplantation is lost."
15745392,"Laboratory surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in Australia, 2003 predicting the future impact of the universal childhood conjugate vaccine program.",2004,"A comprehensive invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) laboratory surveillance program was carried out in Australia in 2003. This program provided data on the prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes and antimicrobial resistance. There were 1,995 isolates tested with 34 per cent (683) from children aged less than five years and 27 per cent (535) from the elderly aged more than 65 years. One thousand eight hundred and sixty were isolates from blood, 79 from CSF and 56 from other sterile sites. In young children, 84 per cent of isolates were a serotype and 92 per cent a serogroup in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV). Of penicillin resistant isolates in children less than five years of age 85 per cent and 98 per cent were a serotype and serogroup in the 7vPCV respectively. When the universal 7vPCV vaccine program in young children is introduced in 2005, a proportion of cases of IPD should also be prevented in young adults (estimated reduction of 54 cases annually) and elderly Australians (an estimated reduction of 110 cases annually) as a result of improved herd immunity. Pneumococcal serotypes with higher rates of penicillin resistance (19F, 14 and 6B) were more prevalent in the elderly than in young children. In contrast, erythromycin resistance was more common in children less than five years of age (24%) compared to the elderly (15%). The predominant serotype with erythromycin resistance in Australia was serotype 14 and thus there is likely to be a major reduction in erythromycin resistance as a result of 7vPCV vaccination. Continued surveillance of pneumococcal serotype distribution and antibiotic susceptibility will be essential in order to identify serotype replacement by non-vaccine serotypes and to monitor the overall impact of current and future vaccine programs on invasive pneumococcal disease in Australia, not only in young children but also in other age groups."
41430585,HELLP syndrome as a major contributor to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes among preeclamptic women: findings from a multicenter retrospective cohort study.,2025,"OBJECTIVE: HELLP syndrome, a severe complication of preeclampsia, is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in preeclamptic women with and without HELLP syndrome in Indonesia. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted across 30 hospitals in Indonesia from January 2022 to December 2023. Data from 1,808 preeclamptic women were analyzed, with 219 (12.1%) classified as having HELLP syndrome. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between the HELLP and non-HELLP groups. RESULTS: Women with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher risks of severe complications, including eclampsia (p < 0.001; aOR: 2.5 (1.5-4.18)), acute kidney injury (p < 0.01; aOR: 4.11 (2.07-8.15)), emergency hypertension (p = 0.048; aOR: 1.42 (1.01-2.01)), preterm birth < 37 weeks (p = 0.013; aOR: 1.54 (1.1-2.17)), and preterm birth < 34 weeks (p < 0.001; aOR: 1.8 (1.28-2.53)). HELLP syndrome increased the risk of Intra-uterine fetal death (p = 0.01; aOR: 2.18 (1.21-3.95)) and neonatal sepsis (p = 0.011; aOR: 2.32 (1.21-4.42)). Although the multivariate analysis did not yield any significant results, the HELLP syndrome group has a substantially higher prevalence of maternal death (3.7% vs 1%; p = 0.005) and neonatal death (11.6% vs 6.4%; p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: HELLP syndrome significantly worsens maternal and neonatal outcomes in preeclampsia, reflecting a need for improved early detection of 'high-risk' preeclamptic women like sFlt1/PLGF ratio and perhaps other laboratory tests like haptoglobin and D-dimer's. Many of these laboratory tests are currently not accessible in the Indonesian public health sector. Further research is needed to identify other markers that would assist in a more timely diagnosis of impending HELLP syndrome, particularly in early-onset preeclampsia patients managed conservatively."
31836584,Performance of the MEDS score in predicting mortality among emergency department patients with a suspected infection: a meta-analysis.,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To carry out a meta-analysis to examine the prognostic performance of the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score in predicting mortality among emergency department patients with a suspected infection. METHODS: Electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Scopus, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library-were searched for eligible articles from their respective inception through February 2019. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and receiver operator characteristic area under the curve were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the prognostic performance of MEDS in selected populations. RESULTS: We identified 24 studies involving 21 246 participants. The pooled sensitivity of MEDS to predict mortality was 79% (95% CI 72% to 84%); specificity was 74% (95% CI 68% to 80%); positive likelihood ratio 3.07 (95% CI 2.47 to 3.82); negative likelihood ratio 0.29 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.37) and area under the curve 0.83 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.86). Significant heterogeneity was seen among included studies. Meta-regression analyses showed that the time at which the MEDS score was measured and the cut-off value used were important sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The MEDS score has moderate accuracy in predicting mortality among emergency department patients with a suspected infection. A study comparison MEDS and qSOFA in the same population is needed."
25537179,[Investigation of the procalcitonin and microbiology test and antibiotics situation from our hospital].,2014,"Procalcitonin (PCT) was first described as a sepsis-associated protein in 1993. PCT is increased in the blood at the time of infection by bacteria. Therefore, it is used as an auxiliary indicator of sepsis diagnosis. In addition, PCT is reduced quickly by antibiotics. And use as a stop or change marker is also expected. We have investigated the antimicrobial use and microbial testing of measurement patient and PCT running performance. Number of requests was 3,387 cases (inpatient 2,649 and outpatient 742 cases) for one year. It was subject to the 820 cases that had inspection request to July to October 2012. In 820 cases, 57 cases had exhibited a PCT >0.5 ng/ml and diagnosed with infectious diseases. In 57 cases, 44 cases (77%) were performed microbiology and blood culture. And only blood culture performed in 8 (14%), blood culture and microbiology is not performed for 5 cases (9%), In 21 (40%) cases of 52 cases performed the blood culture shown positive. Detecting bacteria accounted for more than half in 17 cases of Gram-negative bacilli. Also, it had exhibited a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in 18 cases. Antibiotics have been used in all cases regardless of implementation of the microbiology test. If sepsis is suspected, it is necessary for diagnosis is done correctly and quickly. Therefore, PCT has been suggested high usefulness by examining in the hospital. It is required that the reference identification and drug susceptibility results of the pathogenic bacterium combination of microbiology test and the PCT. We considered useful to PCT monitoring that as an indicator of antimicrobial agents change or shorten of antibiotic use period. Future, proactive use of clinical practice is expected."

15596303,[Descriptive study of bacteremia in a geriatric hospital].,2004,"OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features, microbiologic characteristics and outcome of bacteremia in the elderly patients hospitalized in a geriatric hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia diagnosed from January 1(st) to December 31(st) 1998 were analysed, excluding false-positive cases due to skin contamination. The hospital comprises 1084 geriatric beds distributed as 111 in acute care (ACF), 333 in rehabilitation and intermediate-care (RICF), and 516 in long-term-care facilities (LTCF). RESULTS: Sixty-six episodes of bacteremia were observed in 65 patients. Among them 59 (89%) were nosocomial bacteremia distributed as 20 in ACF, 29 in RICF and 10 in LTCF (rates of 0.6, 0.35, and 0.05 episodes per 1000 patient-days, respectively.). Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the main bacterial species involved in 31% and 28% of the cases, respectively. E. coli strains were 50% resistant to amoxicillin and 41% resistant to co-amoxiclav, and 68% of S. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. Portals of entry were urinary tract (44%), respiratory tract (14%), digestive tract (11%), and soft tissue (8%). The same bacterial strain as in bacteremia was isolated from a peripheric site in 30 cases (47%), most of them being urines. For 15% cases, portal of entry cannot be determined. Mortality associated to nosocomial bacteremia was 25%, and death was significantly associated to MRSA, urinary or intravascular devices, chronic wounds and inappropriate antibiotic prescription. CONCLUSION: In geriatric hospitals, bacteremia are mainly nosocomial cases. Prevention should focus on indwelling devices and antibiotic resistance."
19963522,Transfer function analysis of baroreflex function in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock.,2009,"Sepsis is characterized by profound cardiovascular abnormalities which may result from the derangements in the arterial baroreflex system and other autonomic regulatory functions. In this study, a mechanically ventilated and anesthetized rabbit model of endotoxic shock was utilized to mimic the behaviors of the cardiovascular system in a sepsis patient. 13 adult New Zealand white rabbits were studied, with 8 of them injected with endotoxin and the remaining given saline solution as sham fluid. Measurements of heart period (RRi) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were obtained pre-and post-intervention after a 90 minute period, which allowed spectral and cross-spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variabilities to be performed. A significant increase of blood lactate level (p < 0.01) in post-intervention stage signified the onset of distributive shock. Based on this model, the novel findings were that in the low frequency (LF) and mid frequency (MF) bands, there was a decrease in coherence (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively) and loss of phase delay (p < 0.05) between SBP and RRi, along with a depression in transfer function gain in the LF band (p < 0.05), which might indicate an impairment of baroreflex control of heart rate following the administration of endotoxin. None of the above variables changed significantly in the control group. Moreover, endotoxin also led to a decrease in RRi variability in the ventilatory frequency (VF) band, suggesting a suppression of cardiac vagal modulation. These results highlight the potential value of frequency spectrum analysis combined with transfer function analysis of cardiovascular variability in the assessment of autonomic and baroreflex-related changes associated with endotoxic shock."
15605181,"Neonatal candidiasis: analysis of epidemiology, drug susceptibility, and molecular typing of causative isolates.",2004,"A prospective observational study of invasive candidiasis was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Aristotle University in Hippokration Hospital between 1994 and 2000. During this period, 59 neonates developed invasive candidiasis (58 cases of candidemia and 1 case of peritonitis), resulting in an overall incidence of 1.28% that showed a decreasing trend over the study period. Eleven (18.6%) cases developed within the first week of life and the others within a mean (+/-SEM) of 13.4+/-1.7 days after birth. The three most frequent causative species were Candida albicans (65.5%), Candida parapsilosis (15.5%), and Candida tropicalis (7%). C. albicans was the predominant species between 1994 and 1998, whereas, non-albicans Candida spp., particularly C. parapsilosis, were the most frequent species during the period 1999-2000 (P<0.001). While the overall mortality due to candidemia was 29% (17 of 59 cases), mortality associated with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was 39.5% and 11.1%, respectively (P=0.032), and that observed in the 1999-2000 period was 0% (P=0.011). Virtually all isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and itraconazole, and no increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations were observed during these years. With the exception of a limited cluster of cases due to genotypically identical isolates, no clonal relation of C. albicans isolates was found. Moreover, no clonal persistence of C. albicans and no decrease in antifungal drug susceptibility occurred over the 6-year study period. Non-albicans Candida spp., mostly C. parapsilosis, have emerged as important pathogens in neonatal intensive care units, with infected patients having better outcomes as compared to patients infected with C. albicans."
31990465,The potential utility of real-time PCR of the 16S-rRNA gene in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.,2019,"Istanbullu K, Koksal N, Cetinkaya M, Ozkan H, Yakut T, Karkucak M, Dogan H. The potential utility of real-time PCR of the 16S-rRNA gene in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 493-499. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S rRNA gene in diagnosis of neonatal sepsis and compare it with conventional blood culture. A total of 150 infants were enrolled in this prospective study. The infants were classified into two groups: sepsis group (n=100) and control group (n=50). Blood samples for complete blood count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, serum-amyloid A, blood culture and PCR were obtained before initiating antibiotic treatment. Eight specific probes were used to perform PCR analysis for detection of 8 different microorganisms. The positivity rates of blood culture and PCR were found as 11% and 3%, respectively. The diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by PCR revealed a 16.6 % sensitivity, 97.8 % specificity, 33.3% positive predictive value and 94.8% negative predictive value compared with the blood culture. This study showed a low sensitivity of PCR of the 16S rRNA gene in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. This may be associated with the identification of rare microorganisms in the blood culture that were not included to PCR analysis. Implementation of all suspectible microorganisms into PCR assay may increase the sensitivity of 16S rRNA gene PCR in diagnosis of neonatal sepsis."
31870831,Efficacy of vitamin C in patients with sepsis: An updated meta-analysis.,2020,"Previous studies have suggested the beneficial effects of vitamin C in patients with sepsis. However, the results could not be reproduced in the subsequent studies. This meta-analysis aimed to reevaluate the value of vitamin C treatment in patients with sepsis. Electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2019 for the studies comparing the effect of vitamin C versus non-vitamin C infusion in patients with sepsis. Data from 10 studies (4 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 6 retrospective studies) involving 1671 patients (495 in the vitamin C treatment group and 1176 in the control group) were included. The use of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of 28-day (OR = 0.84, P = 0.611, I(2) = 56.3%), intensive care unit (ICU; OR = 0.79, P = 0.319, I(2) = 46.2%), or in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.76, P = 0.251, I(2) = 51.0%). No difference in the duration of vasopressor usage and the length of ICU or hospital stay was present. The subgroup analysis for two RCTs suggested that vitamin C treatment showed reduced 28-day mortality (OR = 0.22, P = 0.014, I(2) = 35.7%), whereas this beneficial effect did not occur in subgroup analysis for three retrospective studies (OR = 1.11, P = 0.527, I(2) = 0%). Retrospective meta-analysis could not reveal the beneficial effect of vitamin C on patients with sepsis. Therefore, in order to clarify the role of vitamin C in sepsis the high-quality RCTs will be required in the future study."
25550206,"Human experimental endotoxemia in modeling the pathophysiology, genomics, and therapeutics of innate immunity in complex cardiometabolic diseases.",2015,"Inflammation is a fundamental feature of several complex cardiometabolic diseases. Indeed, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis are all closely linked inflammatory states. Increasing evidence suggests that the infectious, biome-related, or endogenous activation of the innate immune system may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Here, we describe the human experimental endotoxemia model for the specific study of innate immunity in understanding further the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease. In a controlled, experimental setting, administration of an intravenous bolus of purified Escherichia coli endotoxin activates innate immunity in healthy human volunteers. During endotoxemia, changes emerge in glucose metabolism, lipoprotein composition, and lipoprotein functions that closely resemble those observed chronically in inflammatory cardiovascular disease risk states. In this review, we describe the transient systemic inflammation and specific metabolic consequences that develop during human endotoxemia. Such a model provides a controlled induction of systemic inflammation, eliminates confounding, undermines reverse causation, and possesses unique potential as a starting point for genomic screening and testing of novel therapeutics for treatment of the inflammatory underpinning of cardiometabolic disease."
19953222,Combination antibiotic therapy with macrolides improves survival in intubated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.,2010,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on survival of macrolides or fluoroquinolones in intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe community-acquired pneumonia (severe CAP). METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort, multicenter study conducted in 27 ICUs of 9 European countries. Two hundred eighteen consecutive patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of CAP were recruited. RESULTS: Severe sepsis and septic shock were present in 165 (75.7%) patients. Microbiological documentation was obtained in 102 (46.8%) patients. ICU mortality was 37.6% (n = 82). Non-survivors were older (58.6 +/- 16.1 vs. 63.4 +/- 16.7 years, P < 0.05) and presented a higher score on the simplified Acute Physiology Score II at admission (45.6 +/- 15.4 vs. 50.8 +/- 17.5, P < 0.05). Monotherapy was given in 43 (19.7%) and combination therapy in 175 (80.3%) patients. Empirical antibiotic therapy was in accordance with the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines in 100 (45.9%) patients (macrolides in 46 patients and fluoroquinolones in 54). In this cohort, a Cox regression analysis adjusted by severity identified that macrolide use was associated with lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio, HR 0.48, confidence intervals, 95% CI 0.23-0.97, P = 0.04) when compared to the use of fluoroquinolones. When more severe patients presenting severe sepsis and septic shock were analyzed (n = 92), similar results were obtained (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.95, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia had a low adherence with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines. Combination therapy with macrolides should be preferred in intubated patients with severe CAP."
25631968,Clinical features of catheter-related candidemia at disease onset.,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Early detection of catheter-related candidemia is necessary to ensure that patients receive prompt and appropriate treatment. The aim of the present case-control study is to investigate the clinical features of catheter-related candidemia at disease onset, so as to determine the clinical indications for empiric antifungal therapy. METHODS: All 41 cases of catheter-related candidemia from September 2009 to August 2011 at a teaching hospital were included in the present study. To determine the characteristics that were risk factors for developing catheter-related candidemia, we compared all cases of catheter-related candidemia with all 107 cases of catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) caused by non-Candida spp. RESULTS: In comparison with CRBSI due to non-Candida spp., the duration of catheter use was significantly longer in cases of catheter-related candidemia (13.9 +/- 9.0 days vs. 23.2 +/- 25.2 days). There was also a significant difference in the frequency of pre-antibiotic treatment between catheter-related candidemia and CRBSI due to non-Candida spp. (97.6% [40/41 cases] vs. 44.9% [48/107 cases]). Patients with catheter-related candidemia also had significantly more severe clinical statuses (measured using the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score) than patients with CRBSI due to non-Candida spp. (7.63 +/- 3.65 vs. 5.92 +/- 2.81). CONCLUSION: When compared to patients with CRBSI caused by non-Candida spp., patients with catheter-related candidemia had significantly more severe clinical backgrounds, longer duration of catheter use and more frequent prior administration of antibiotic agents."
17039147,Pyogenic arthritis caused by capnocytophaga gingivalis in an immunocompetent three-year-old male.,2001,"Capnocytophaga gingivalis is most often isolated as normal oral flora or with periodontal disease. This organism is also associated with sepsis usually in immunocompromised hosts. We identified pyogenic arthritis caused by C. gingivalis in a 3-year-old immunocompetent male, whose clinical course closely resembled monoarticular onset pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This is the first report of C. gingivalis septic arthritis in the world literature, but there are increasing reports of infections with this carbon dioxide-loving organism at other sites in non-immunocompromised individuals. The subacute presentation of the monoarthritis with this organism of low virulence led to a long delay in diagnosis and treatment. Any monoarthritis must continue to raise concern about infection."
31858497,Lung Contusion in Polytrauma: An Analysis of the TraumaRegister DGU.,2021,"BACKGROUND:  Thorax trauma frequently occurs in which injuries to the bony chest, lung contusions (LCs), and others are diagnosed. The significance of this violation is described very differently and is mostly based on monocentric data. METHODS:  A retrospective analysis of the TraumaRegister DGU((R)) (TR-DGU) dataset (Project 2014-062) was performed between 2009 and 2014 (injury severity score [ISS] >/= 16, primary admission to a trauma center, no isolated traumatic brain injury). Patients with LC (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] 3 + 4) were compared with the control group, and an analysis of different age groups was performed. RESULTS:  A total of 49,567 patients were included, thereunder 14,521 (29.3%) without relevant thoracic trauma (TT); 95.9% blunt traumas. 18,892 patients (38.1%) had LC and 14,008 (28.3%) had severe LC with AIS 3 + 4; thereunder 72.7% males. For severe LC, the average age was the lowest (44.7 +/- 19.7 years) and ISS the highest (30.4 +/- 12.1 points).Intubation, intensive care, (multi-) organ failure, sepsis, and extrathoracic injuries were most common in severe LC. Shock, chest tubes, further thoracic injuries, and patient death occurred most frequently in TT without LC.Younger patients showed a higher incidence of LC than the older ones; however, high patient age was a highly significant risk factor for the development of complications and poor outcome. CONCLUSION:  Since LC was present in almost 40% of the severely injured and was related to higher morbidity, LC should be detected and managed at the earliest possible time. Proper follow-ups employing chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are recommended."
41408335,Pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury: a case report and review of the literature.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease that is rarely diagnosed in Europe. Its clinical presentation is highly variable, requiring consideration of a broad differential diagnosis. METHODS: We present a case report of a pulmonary tularemia with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis causing acute kidney injury, and a systematic review of the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 73-year-old white man who presented with pneumonia, sepsis and acute kidney injury due to a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with negativity for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Initial management with dialysis, empirical antibiotics, and immunosuppression was adjusted after identification of Francisella tularensis, and targeted antibiotic therapy was administered successfully. At 4 years of follow-up, no recurrence was observed. LITERATURE REVIEW: Our review of the literature identified only a few case reports of tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury. None documented biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary tularemia complicated by acute kidney injury is an uncommon clinical constellation. Biopsy-proven pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-negativity in this setting appears to be very rare. Careful differential diagnosis, early recognition of tularemia, and timely initiation of effective antibiotic therapy are critical to achieving favorable outcomes."

41469631,Plasma presepsin as a predictor of mortality in patients with UTI-related severe infection: a single-center retrospective study.,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether plasma presepsin levels are a more reliable predictor of mortality than traditional infection biomarkers in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI)-related severe infection. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated 69 patients with UTI-related severe infection admitted to the emergency department between May 2022 and August 2023. Data on vital signs, plasma presepsin levels, procalcitonin (PCT) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and other laboratory values at admission were collected. The values of presepsin, PCT, CRP, and WBC count for predicting 28-day mortality were analyzed. Survivors and non-survivors were propensity score-matched in a 2:1 ratio based on age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, presepsin showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.716 for predicting 28-day mortality, surpassing that of PCT (0.641), CRP (0.488), and WBC count (0.433). Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk (hazard ratio, 1.026; p = 0.008). In the matched cohort, presepsin levels showed the highest AUROC (0.660), followed by PCT (0.584), CRP (0.496), and WBC count (0.436). CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin levels were independently associated with increased 28-day mortality risk; this may be a valuable biomarker for identifying high-risk patients with UTI-related severe infection.

25498081,"Kinetics of interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein after pediatric liver transplantation.",2014,"In the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation (pLT) several concomitant factors may reduce the performance of established sepsis markers. To date, their clinical interpretation is hindered by a lack of information on their postoperative kinetics. To gather more information on the postoperative course and their changes in bacterial sepsis, we prospectively studied C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT) on 9 perioperative days in 25 consecutive pLTs. After an initial postoperative peak, IL-6 and CRP levels significantly re-increased in patients with bacterial sepsis (P < .001). In contrast, PCT had very high postoperative levels; therefore severe infection was a comparatively inferior trigger for PCT elevation compared with the initial operation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to diagnose postoperative sepsis for PCT was only 0.52, compared with 0.95 for IL-6 and 0.89 for CRP. None of the studied biomarkers were depressed by poor graft function. In conclusion, PCT performs poorly as a biomarker for sepsis in the early phase after pLT. With a rapid decline of initially elevated levels, IL-6 provides the best kinetics for detection of postoperative bacterial sepsis."
32166240,A 10-Year Longitudinal Analysis of Protocol-Based Sepsis Management in a Philippine Tertiary ICU.,2019,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of sepsis management using protocol-based therapy versus non-protocolized care, assessed over 10 years. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, analyzed longitudinally with risk-adjusted control charts, referenced against hospital- and unit-level programs or interventions. SETTING: Private, tertiary teaching hospital ICU in the Philippines. PATIENTS: Nine-hundred fifty adult patients (19 yr old or older) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock, using 2001 consensus definitions, admitted to the ICU from September 2007 to August 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Three iterations of a standard clinical pathway (including early antibiotics, prescribed fluid resuscitation, and hemodynamic management) versus concurrent non-protocolized care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven-hundred sixty patients were in the protocol-based care group versus 190 in the non-protocolized care group. Protocol-based management was associated with lower hospital mortality (28.4% vs 44.7%; p = 0.00) and ICU mortality (24.2% vs 31.6%; p = 0.038). There were no differences in ICU or hospital length-of-stay, mechanical ventilator days, or vasoactive days. Risk-Adjusted Cumulative Sum and Risk-Adjusted Exponentially Weighted Moving Average control charts showed that a survival advantage was achieved after 1 year and was sustained over the duration of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Protocol-based management was associated with sustained improvements in the survival of sepsis patients over 10 years in this hospital setting, after a run-in period of 1 year. Hospital- and unit-level interventions may have measurable impacts on the efficacy of sepsis clinical pathways."
16201706,"Anthrax: pathological aspects in autopsy cases in Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1960-2001.",2004,"Anthrax, like tuberculosis, shows a new epidemic spread in industrialized countries, revealing some ambiguous aspects to the disease and providing new challenges to medicine. Shiraz University of Medical Sciences has records of 7130 autopsies performed in the past 40 years, 33 of which are anthrax cases. We reviewed all the pathology slides of these cases and classified the organs involved in a search for unrecognized microscopic findings. The most common cause of death was sepsis, caused by organ involvement and direct cytotoxicity of Bacillus anthracis, in addition to its exotoxin production. Novel findings included hyaline membrane formation in respiratory system cases that is similar to acute (adult) respiratory distress syndrome and evidence of primary gastrointestinal involvement, showing the ability of the organism to pass the gastric barrier."
25643609,MIF and CD74 - suitability as clinical biomarkers.,2014,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine whose effects on arresting 'random' immune cell movement was already recognized decades ago. MIF is quasi-constitutively expressed by a variety of different cells and tissues, including immune cells such as T-cells and monocytes/macrophages, but also nonimmune cells like certain endocrine cells and cells lining interior body cavities or contacting the exterior environment, such as endothelial cells (ECs), or epithelial cells in kidney, gut and skin. Contrary to its historic name, MIF has a direct chemokine-like function and promotes 'directed' cell migration (i.e. chemotaxis) and plays a prominent role in inflammatory and atherogenic leukocyte recruitment. At the molecular level, these activities are based on a non-cognate interaction between MIF and the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. Importantly, MIF also interacts with surface CD74, a type II transmembrane protein, inducing its phosphorylation and the recruitment of CD44, leading ultimately to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Multiple studies have pointed to the utility of MIF as a biomarker for different diseases that have an inflammatory component; these include systemic infections and sepsis, cancer, autoimmune diseases as well as different metabolic disorders. In this Review, we highlight the suitability of MIF and CD74 as biomarkers for different disease applications."
32025431,Effect of Beta-blockers on Tachycardia in Patients with Pulmonary Embolism.,2019,"Hypothesis Beta-blockers (BBs) lower the heart rate, which may mask the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) since one of the main clinical diagnoses of PE is tachycardia. The endpoint of our retrospective study is to determine if the pre-existing use of (BB) significantly affects the utility of these scoring criteria in diagnosing PE. Introduction Diagnosing PE is a challenge because of the non-specificity of its symptoms and signs. The initial step is to assess the patient's likelihood of having a PE. This involves using a scoring system to stratify patients into different levels of risk of having PE (for example, as 'low,' 'moderate,' or 'high' risk). Some of the commonly used criteria are Wells' Score, Geneva Score, and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) Rule (Charlotte Rule). Methodology This retrospective study was conducted at St. Francis Medical Center. Subjects were taken from a patient population with a new diagnosis of PE (between 2010 and 2017) on the basis of computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. Patients with sepsis or septic shock, heart block, atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation, pacemaker placement, or taking more than one AV nodal blocker were excluded from the study. Subjects were categorized on the basis of beta-blocker consumption. Result Out of a total of 170 cases, 71 patients were taking beta-blockers and 99 patients were not taking beta-blockers. Among the participants taking BBs, 30.4% had a heart rate <60 and 55.8% had a heart rate between 60 and 100. Conclusion BBs significantly obviate tachycardia in patients with PE. It falsely decreases the Wells' Score and the Geneva Score and results in the inappropriate fulfilling of PERC criteria."
41444511,GPR43 deficiency aggravates sepsis by promoting gut microbiota-dependent barrier disruption and HIF-1alpha-ENO1 axis-mediated M1 polarization of macrophages.,2025,"BACKGROUND: GPR43, a receptor for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is broadly expressed in intestinal epithelial and immune cells and is essential for preserving barrier integrity and immune homeostasis. Nevertheless, how GPR43 influences gut microbiota composition and intestinal barrier integrity while also regulating macrophage immunometabolism in the context of sepsis remains poorly understood. METHODS: A cecal ligation and puncture model was used to induce sepsis in mice. Survival, histopathology, and immune responses were compared between Gpr43(-/-) and wild-type mice; 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed to evaluate gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles. Antibiotic-mediated microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation were used to assess functional impacts. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were employed to investigate the effects of GPR43 deficiency on macrophage polarization. RNA sequencing, metabolic flux analysis, and Western blotting were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients with sepsis were analyzed for clinical correlation. RESULTS: Gpr43(-/-) mice exhibited significantly reduced survival following CLP, along with impaired intestinal barrier function and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels. Microbiota diversity and SCFA-producing bacteria were markedly decreased, accompanied by reduced SCFA levels in fecal metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) partially restored gut function and survival in Gpr43(-/-) mice. GPR43-deficient macrophages displayed a strong M1-polarized phenotype with the upregulation of the glycolytic enzyme ENO1 and its upstream regulator HIF-1alpha. The inhibition of either ENO1 or HIF-1alpha reversed the proinflammatory phenotype. A clinical data analysis revealed that GPR43 expression was negatively correlated with IL-6, ENO1, and lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS: GPR43 exerts a dual protective role in sepsis by maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and barrier integrity and by modulating macrophage metabolism and polarization via the HIF-1alpha-ENO1 axis. This study provides novel insights into the GPR43 in pathogenesis of sepsis and suggests potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

31844532,Disseminated hematogenous tuberculosis in puerperium-case report.,2019,"Although tuberculosis (TB) is relatively common in pregnancy and puerperium, its disseminated form is a rare event, with potential lethal maternal and fetal outcomes. Due to the infrequency and lack of knowledge of most physicians about the various manifestations of the disease, the diagnosis is often overlooked, and treatment postponed, resulting in a high death rate. We report a fatal case of disseminated tuberculosis in the puerperium, with lung, brain, liver and uterine involvement. After, we briefly review the clinical manifestations of TB in the gestational period."
19944898,Lemierre syndrome: a pediatric case series and review of literature.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Lemierre syndrome is a rare disease of the head and neck often affecting adolescents and young adults. Classically, infection begins in the oropharynx with thrombosis of the tonsillar veins followed by involvement of the parapharyngeal space and the internal jugular vein. Septicemia and pulmonary lesions develop as infection spreads via septic emboli. Although a rare entity in modern times, Lemierre syndrome remains a disease of considerable morbidity and potential mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 3 cases and associated literature. RESULTS: A common 1- to 2-week history of fever, sore throat, neck pain, and fatigue was observed in all patients. Patient 1 developed right facial swelling, neck tenderness, trismus, and tonsillar exudate. Patient 2 displayed right tonsillar erythema and enlargement with right neck tenderness. Patient 3 revealed bilateral tonsillar enlargement with exudate and left neck tenderness. Subsequent studies included blood cultures and computed tomography, after which empiric antibiotic therapy was started. Patient 1 underwent drainage of a right peritonsillar abscess, right pressure equalization tube placement, and ligation of the right external jugular vein. He subsequently developed subdural empyemas, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and carotid artery narrowing and required 9 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Patients 2 and 3 developed pulmonary lesions and received 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Timing was crucial in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Lemierre syndrome is a rare but severe opportunistic infection with poor prognostic outcomes if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential. Aggressive antibiotic therapy coupled with surgical intervention, when necessary, provides excellent outcomes."
19938405,[Postnatal sepsis due to group A Streptococcus in a mother and her newborn].,2009,"Nowadays, postnatal sepsis caused by group A Streptococcus (Str. pyogenes) is a rare condition. However, the mortality due to this uncommon disease is still high, and it has been described in the literature more frequently in the last few years. The authors present the case of a female newborn who died 15 hours after spontaneous delivery in the 40th week of gestation. Autopsy revealed a lung edema and solid lung parenchyma with normal findings of the other organs on macroscopic examination. Additional bacteriological testing detected Streptococcus pyogenes in the child. Aspiration pneumonia and signs of sepsis were discovered in the histological examination. Three days postpartum, the mother was hospitalized with Streptococcus pyogenes sepsis. Streptococcus pyogenes colonization of the mother's vaginal flora was assumed to be the origin of the infection. The problem in this case was the macromorphological diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia in the newborn. The importance of microbiological analysis as a matter of routine is emphasized."
18333070,Necrotizing pancreatitis: a surgical approach independent of documented infection.,2004,"BACKGROUND: Strategies for the management of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis remain controversial. While consensus opinion supports operative necrosectomy for the treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis, the timing for surgical intervention is not completely resolved. Further, the indication for the surgical management of sterile pancreatic necrosis is also subject to debate. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate outcome measures for the surgical management of necrotizing pancreatitis, independent of documented infection. A retrospective review was undertaken between 1994 and 2002 at a single county hospital. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with CT-documented necrotizing pancreatitis underwent operative pancreatic necrosectomy with laparostomy within 21 days of initial diagnosis and had an average of three reoperations. Average length of stay (LOS) in the ICU was 36 days and in the hospital 67 days. Ten patients had documented infected necrosis based on initial intra-operative cultures, while I I had sterile necrosis. Overall, 95% (20/21) of the patients had a complication, with an average of three complications per patient. Common complications included ARDS (71%), sepsis (33%), renal failure (24%), and pneumonia (24%). The overall mortality rate was 14% (3/21), with a mean follow-up of 469 days. DISCUSSION: The surgical management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, independent of documented infection, can be undertaken within 3 weeks of diagnosis with an acceptable morbidity and a low mortality rate. Creation of a laparostomy to enable ready, atraumatic debridement of the retroperitoneum is a safe alternative to standard repeat laparotomies and thus represents a useful adjunct to the surgical management of necrotizing pancreatitis."
26407441,Persistent and Prolonged Parvovirus B19 Viremia in a Pediatric Patient With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,2015,"Parvovirus B19 is a small single-stranded DNA virus of the Parvoviridae family. Depending on host factors, it may produce a wide array of clinical disease states. Disease severity can range from self-limited to severe, requiring significant supportive care. Immunocompromised patients are generally affected more severely but rarely develop prolonged and persistent infections. Here, we describe a patient who was diagnosed with parvovirus during maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and required therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin; the patient remained parvovirus positive according to a polymerase chain reaction testing but had no clinical symptoms for 27 months off chemotherapy."
31861867,"Atypical, Yet Not Infrequent, Infections with Neisseria Species.",2019,"Neisseria species are extremely well-adapted to their mammalian hosts and they display unique phenotypes that account for their ability to thrive within niche-specific conditions. The closely related species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are the only two species of the genus recognized as strict human pathogens, causing the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea and meningitis and sepsis, respectively. Gonococci colonize the mucosal epithelium of the male urethra and female endo/ectocervix, whereas meningococci colonize the mucosal epithelium of the human nasopharynx. The pathophysiological host responses to gonococcal and meningococcal infection are distinct. However, medical evidence dating back to the early 1900s demonstrates that these two species can cross-colonize anatomical niches, with patients often presenting with clinically-indistinguishable infections. The remaining Neisseria species are not commonly associated with disease and are considered as commensals within the normal microbiota of the human and animal nasopharynx. Nonetheless, clinical case reports suggest that they can behave as opportunistic pathogens. In this review, we describe the diversity of the genus Neisseria in the clinical context and raise the attention of microbiologists and clinicians for more cautious approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of the many pathologies these species may cause."
25522182,Diagnostic utility of biomarkers for neonatal sepsis--a systematic review.,2015,"Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment of the neonate with suspected sepsis are essential to prevent life-threatening complications. Diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is a challenge due to non-specific clinical signs and the fact that infection markers are difficult to interpret in the first and critical phase of neonatal sepsis. The objective of the present study was to systematically evaluate existing evidence of the diagnostic utility of biomarkers for prediction of sepsis in neonates. We conducted a systematic literature search performed in PubMed and Embase. The study population was neonates with gestation age > 24 weeks in their first 28 days of life with suspected sepsis. The included manuscripts were rated due to criteria from a modified rating scale developed by Douglas Altman. Of 292 potentially relevant manuscripts, 77 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 16 (21%) were rated as high-quality studies. C-reactive protein (CRP) was the most extensively studied biomarker evaluated. The high-quality studies indicated that the acute phase protein serum amyloid A had high sensitivity, both at onset of symptoms and 2 days after. The studies evaluating serum amyloid A presented a variable positive predictive value (PPV, 0.67 and 0.92) with a high negative predictive value (NPV, 0.97 and 1.00). The existing evidence of the diagnostic value of serum amyloid A for neonatal sepsis showed promising results, and should be further investigated in clinical settings."
25504132,[Genotyping and evaluation of infection dynamics in a Colombian isolate of Leptospira santarosai in hamster as an experimental model].,2014,"INTRODUCTION: Is necessary to develop models for the study of leptospirosis. OBJECTIVE: To genotype a Colombian strain of Leptospira isolated from a human with Weil s syndrome and to evaluate its infection dynamics in the hamster experimental model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotyping was performed by amplification and sequence analysis of the rrs 16S and lipL32 genes. The median lethal dose was determined in intraperitoneally inoculated hamsters. The patterns of clinical chemistry, the duration of leptospiremia, leptospiruria and pathological findings were studied and compared in the same animal model infected with L. interrogans (Fiocruz L1-130). RESULTS: Molecular typing revealed that the isolate corresponded to the pathogenic species L. santarosai, which was recovered from hamsters  kidneys and lungs and detected by lipL32 PCR from day 3 post-infection in these organs. There was a marked increase of C-reactive protein in animals at day 5 post-infection (3.25 mg/dl; normal value: 0.3 mg/dl) with decreases by day 18 (2.60 mg/dl: normal value: 0.8 mg/dl). Biomarkers of urea showed changes consistent with possible renal acute failure (day 5 post-infection: 49.01 mg/dl and day 18 post-infection: 53.71 mg/dl). Histopathological changes included interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of hemorrhage and interstitial nephritis. CONCLUSION: The pathogenic species L. santarosai was identified in Colombia. Its pathogenicity as determined by tropism to lung and kidney was comparable to that of L. interrogans Fiocruz L1-130, well known for its virulence and pulmonar tropism. The biological aspects studied here had never before been evaluated in an autochthonous isolate."
32029043,[Usage of oXiris hemofilter for septic shock patients: a single-center experience].,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oXiris hemofilter for septic shock patients. METHODS: Clinical data of septic shock patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with oXiris hemofilter in department of surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from March 1st, 2018 to July 20th, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), oxygenation index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)), lactate (Lac), platelet count (PLT), serum procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), noradrenaline (NE) dosage, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure score (SOFA) were compared before and after oXiris treatment and the prognosis were also analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients with septic shock were included [5 males, the average age was (56.3+/-11.8) years old]. A total of 13 oXiris hemofilter sets were performed during treatment. Compared with before treatment, the HR, IL-6 and CRP levels were significantly decreased after treatment [HR (bpm): 93.8+/-9.7 vs. 133.5+/-18.3, IL-6 (ng/L): 509.2+/-169.6 vs. 3 739.8+/-618.2, CRP (mg/L): 169.1+/-148.3 vs. 277.8+/-68.7, all P < 0.05], MAP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) and PLT were significantly increased [MAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 73.3+/-2.2 vs. 63.3+/-1.6, PaO(2)/FiO(2) (mmHg): 166.8+/-40.4 vs. 95.1+/-56.2, PLT (x10(9)/L): 73.3+/-27.5 vs. 41.2+/-21.4, all P < 0.05]; meanwhile, NE dosage, APACHE II and SOFA scores were significantly decreased [NE (mugxkg(-1)xmin(-1)): 0.4+/-0.3 vs. 1.2+/-0.7, APACHE II: 18.8+/-6.9 vs. 30.0+/-7.3, SOFA: 11.7+/-4.2 vs. 17.3+/-2.1, all P < 0.05]. Although Lac and PCT decreased after treatment, there was no significant difference [Lac (mmol/L): 3.5+/-2.1 vs. 6.1+/-3.2, PCT (mug/L): 37.7+/-48.3 vs. 85.1+/-32.8, both P > 0.05]. At the end, 3 of the 6 patients survived and the others were discharged again medical advice. The length of SICU stay was 3 to 23 days, with an average of (13.0+/-8.5) days. No adverse events occurred during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: oXiris hemofilter can effectively remove inflammatory mediators in circulation, significantly improve hemodynamic status and severity, and may be considered as a safe and reliable treatment modality for septic shock patients."
20077944,"Epidemiology and susceptibility to antimicrobials in community, hospital and long-term care facility bacteremia in northern Israel: a 6 year surveillance.",2009,"BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogens and their susceptibility to antimicrobials is mandatory for successful empiric antibiotic treatment. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical characteristics of patients with bacteremia, as well as the bacterial distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility in community, hospital and long-term care facilities during two periods (2001-2002 and 2005-2006). METHODS: The study was conducted at the HaEmek Medical Center, a community 500-bed teaching hospital in northern Israel serving a population of approximately 500,000 inhabitants. All episodes of bacteremia (n = 1546) during two 2 year periods (2001-2 and 2005-6) were prospectively recorded, evaluated and compared (755 in 2001-2 and 791 in 2005-6). RESULTS: In both periods the urinary tract was the main port of entry in community and long-term care facility bacteremia, while the urinary tract--primary and catheter-related--were similar in frequency as sources of hospital bacteremia. Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolate. No significant changes in the frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were seen between the two 2 year periods (2001-2 and 2005-6). The susceptibility of non-ESBL-producing E. coli decreased for some antibiotics while non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibility profile improved in the same period. A non-statistically significant trend of increased resistance in gram-negative isolates to quinolones, piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam was observed, but most isolates still remained highly susceptible to carbapenems. There was a small increase in mortality rate in hospital bacteremia during the second period. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous surveillance is imperative for monitoring the local epidemiology and for developing local treatment guidelines."
15652449,Sequential measurement of IL-6 blood levels in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis.,2005,"This study was undertaken to investigate whether sequential measurement of blood interleukin (IL)-6 levels using chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) would be useful for the management of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis. Forty consecutive patients with SIRS/sepsis admitted to ICU were involved in the study. Blood IL-6 level was measured everyday throughout their ICU stay at the clinical laboratory by CLEIA method. The platelet count and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were measured consecutively. The blood IL-6 levels were elevated in SIRS/sepsis patients and were extremely high in patients with septic shock. There was no significant difference in the blood IL-6 level on admission between survivors (n=27) and non-survivors (n=13). However, the mean blood IL-6 level during ICU stay was significantly higher in the non-survivors (p<0.05). There were significant correlation between the peak IL-6 blood level and the lowest platelet count, and between the peak IL-6 blood level and the maximum SOFA score, respectively. The platelet count became lowest 2.0+/-2.0 days later on average, and the SOFA score became maximal 2.5+/-1.4 days later on average following the day when IL-6 reached its peak value. Sequential measurement of blood IL-6 levels by CLEIA is useful in evaluating the severity and in predicting the outcome of the patients with SIRS/sepsis."
25734138,Sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin in predicting bacterial infections in patients with renal impairment.,2014,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether procalcitonin is an accurate predictor of bacterial infections in patients with renal impairment, although it is used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy and best predictive value of procalcitonin for predicting bacterial infection in adult patients with severe renal impairment. METHODS: Retrospective study at a single-center community teaching hospital involving 473 patients, ages 18-65, with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease eGFR </=30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), admitted between January 2009 and June 2012, with 660 independent hospital visits. A positive or negative culture (blood or identifiable focus of infection) was paired to the highest procalcitonin result performed 48 hours before or after collecting the culture. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity to predict bacterial infection, using a procalcitonin level threshold of 0.5 ng/mL, was 0.80 and 0.35 respectively. When isolating for presence of bacteremia, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 and 0.35 respectively. An equation adjusting for optimum thresholds of procalcitonin levels for predicting bacterial infection at different levels of eGFR had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.55 and 0.80 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin is not a reliably sensitive or specific predictor of bacterial infection in patients with renal impairment when using a single threshold. Perhaps two thresholds should be employed, where below the lower threshold (i.e. 0.5 ng/mL) bacterial infection is unlikely with a sensitivity of 0.80, and above the higher threshold (i.e. 3.2 ng/mL) bacterial infection is very likely with a specificity of 0.75."
20039062,Munchausen syndrome by proxy mimicking as Gaucher disease.,2010,"Although rare, Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MBP) is a potentially life-threatening form of child abuse. Here, we report a 19-month-old female infant who presented with hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent septicemia. She was initially thought to have myelodysplastic syndrome. Further hematological and immunological investigations revealed no cause. beta-Glucosylceramidase enzyme activity on dried blood spot was suggestive of Gaucher disease. However, the enzyme level on cultured skin fibroblast was not consistent with Gaucher disease. The first hint about MBP was the recurrent sepsis with numerous gram negative rods. Furthermore, the mother's behavior and health history raised our suspicion about MBP. The child showed significant improvement after she was separated from the mother for a week. Finally, the mother confessed that she was spitting in local herbs and injecting it into the central line. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of MBP resembling in its presentation Gaucher disease. This case should alert the general and specialized pediatricians about MBP, as it may mimic metabolic diseases like Gaucher disease."
20002853,Necrotizing fasciitis: review of 82 cases in South Auckland.,2011,"BACKGROUND: Early recognition of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) can be difficult, but is important as infections progress rapidly and have significant mortality. The aim of this study of patients with NF was to determine the clinical characteristics at presentation, causative pathogens and subsequent clinical outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with NF presenting to Middlemore Hospital from January 2000 to June 2006. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were evaluated: 56% male, mean age 54.9 years (standard deviation 18.5), 40% Pacific Islanders. The site of infection was the lower limb in 46 (56%) patients, upper limb in 12 (15%) patients and perineum in 13 (16%) patients. Twenty-two (27%) patients were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 29 (35%) had diabetes mellitus, 25 (30%) had gout and 17 (21%) had congestive heart failure. Forty-nine (60%) patients had a surgical procedure within 24 h of admission. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from tissue or blood cultures in 33 (40%) patients and 26 (32%) patients had polymicrobial infection. Twenty-five (30%) patients died, 17 (68%) within 72 h of admission. Independent predictors of mortality include congestive heart failure (P = 0.033) and a history of gout (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: NF remains an important disease in our community with significant morbidity and mortality. Pacific Islanders were disproportionately represented. Early diagnosis of NF can be difficult and requires a high index of suspicion in all patients presenting with cellulitis or unexplained sepsis. Congestive heart failure and gout are independent predictors of mortality and patients with these conditions and sepsis need early assessment with more aggressive hospital triaging."
25638997,"Factors influencing antibiotic treatment cost and outcome in critically ill patients: a ""real-life"" study.",2014,"BACKGROUND/AIM. Critically ill patients are at very high risk of developing severe infections in intensive care units (ICUs). Procalcitonin (PCT) levels are eleveted in the circulation in patients with bacterial sepsis and PCT might be useful in guiding antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate factors influencing patients survival and treatment cost in ICU with special emphasis on the impact of PCT serum levels use in guiding antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: The study was conducted from August 2010 to May 2012 in the Intensive Therapy Unit, Clinic of Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, Military Medical Academy (MMA), Belgrade, Serbia. All adult critically ill patients with sepsis and/or trauma admitted in the ICU were included in the study. This study included only the cost of antimicrobial therapy in the ICU and the cost for PCT analysis. We used prices valid in the MMA for the year 2012. PCT in serum was measured by homogeneous immunoassay on a Brahms Kryptor analyzer. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The mean patients age was 55 +/- 19 years and 61.8% of patients were male. The mean length of stay (LOS) in the ICU was 12 +/- 21 days. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the sepsis and trauma group regarding outcome (higher mortality rate was in the sepsis group, particularly in the patients with peritonitis who were mostly women). The patients younger than 70 years had better chance of survival. LOS, the use of carbapenems and PCT-measurement influenced the cost of therapy in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results show that age, the diagnosis and gender were the main predictors of survival of critically ill patients in the ICU. The cost of ICU stay was dependent on LOS, use of carbapenems and PCT-measurement although the influence of these three factors on the outcome in the patients did not reach a statistical significance."
31859245,"Belantamab mafodotin for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (DREAMM-2): a two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase 2 study.",2020,"BACKGROUND: Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916), an immunoconjugate targeting B-cell maturation antigen, showed single-agent activity in the phase 1 DREAMM-1 study in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We further investigated the safety and activity of belantamab mafodotin in the DREAMM-2 study. METHODS: DREAMM-2 is an open-label, two-arm, phase 2 study done at 58 multiple myeloma specialty centres in eight countries. Patients (aged >/=18 years) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with disease progression after three or more lines of therapy and who were refractory to immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors, and refractory or intolerant (or both) to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited, centrally randomly assigned (1:1) with permuted blocks (block size 4), and stratified by previous lines of therapy (</=4 vs >4) and cytogenetic features to receive 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg belantamab mafodotin via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks on day 1 of each cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The intention-to-treat population comprised all randomised patients, regardless of treatment administration. The safety population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of belantamab mafodotin. The primary outcome was the proportion of randomly assigned patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved an overall response, as assessed by an independent review committee. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03525678, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 18, 2018, and Jan 2, 2019, 293 patients were screened and 196 were included in the intention-to-treat population (97 in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 99 in the 3.4 mg/kg cohort). As of June 21, 2019 (the primary analysis data cutoff date), 30 (31%; 97.5% CI 20.8-42.6) of 97 patients in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 34 (34%; 23.9-46.0) of 99 patients in the 3.4 mg/kg cohort achieved an overall response. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the safety population were keratopathy (in 26 [27%] of 95 patients in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 21 [21%] of 99 patients in the 3.4 mg/kg cohort), thrombocytopenia (19 [20%] and 33 [33%]), and anaemia (19 [20%] and 25 [25%]); 38 (40%) of 95 patients in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 47 (47%) of 99 in the 3.4 mg/kg cohort reported serious adverse events. Two deaths were potentially treatment related (one case of sepsis in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort and one case of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the 3.4 mg/kg cohort). INTERPRETATION: Single-agent belantamab mafodotin shows anti-myeloma activity with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline."
20016995,Catheter-related Corynebacterium bacteremia: should the catheter be removed and vancomycin administered?,2010,"The purpose of this study was to determine the need for central venous catheter removal in patients with corynebacterial catheter-related bloodstream infections and the impact of central venous catheter retention on response to systemic antibiotic therapy and relapse. We searched the microbiology laboratory database and patients' medical records at our institution between January 2000 and December 2006. We identified 98 patients with corynebacteria infection. Most of the episodes (94%) were catheter-related. Removing the catheter did not affect the outcome of treatment, particularly when an active non-glycopeptide antibiotic was used. All Corynebacterium species isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, 54/55 (98%) to linezolid, 80/95 (84%) to rifampin, and 69/85 (81%) to tetracycline. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 12 days (range, 0-28), and vancomycin was the most commonly used antibiotic (64%). There was a trend toward earlier fever resolution in patients treated with non-glycopeptide antibiotics compared to vancomycin, particularly if the catheter was not removed. Central venous catheter removal might not be necessary in patients with corynebacterial catheter related bloodstream infection, particularly if systemic therapy consists of non-glycopeptide antibiotics. Treatment with a systemic active antibiotic over a 7-day period appears to be adequate for resolution of the infection."
31891234,Burden of cytomegalovirus DNAemia among pediatric renal transplant patients on antiviral prophylaxis: A hospital-based analysis.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We examined the burden of CMV DNAemia and time to such events among renal transplant patients receiving CMV prophylaxis. We targeted the first year after transplantation, with the primary focus being on the first 3 months. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of renal transplant patients (<18 years) who were transplanted and followed at our center between January 2007, and December 2017. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records and laboratory databases. RESULTS: Among 141 patients, the median age at transplant was 12.7 years (range 0.87-17.83 years). CMV DNAemia was detected in 33 of 77 patients eligible for prophylaxis (42.9%; 95% CI 31.6-54.6) during the first post-transplant year. Proportionately more D+R- patients were present among patients with DNAemia compared with those without DNAemia (15/38, 39.5% vs 16/103, 15.5%, P = .005). Median time to first positivity was 134 days (range 0-304 days). Eight patients had a positive PCR during the first 3 months (5.7% of all patients). Among those eligible for prophylaxis, 6.5% had DNAemia during the first 3 months while on prophylaxis. Among patients whose first positive PCR was after 3 months post-transplant, the median time to positivity was 52 days (range 13-214 days) after the end of prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough CMV DNAemia was documented among children receiving antiviral prophylaxis. While routine monitoring while on prophylaxis might not be warranted for the majority of patients, studies are needed to determine the optimal indications for CMV PCR testing while on prophylaxis."
31818728,"Diagnosis, grading, and treatment recommendations for children, adolescents, and young adults with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome: an international expert position statement.",2020,"Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, also known as hepatic veno-occlusive disease, is a potentially life-threatening complication that occurs in children undergoing haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Differences in the incidence of genetic predisposition and clinical presentation of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome between children and adults have rendered the historical Baltimore and Seattle diagnostic criteria insufficient for children. In 2017, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) proposed the first paediatric diagnostic and severity grading guidelines for sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, intended for implementation across European centres. However, universally accepted paediatric criteria are needed to ensure prompt diagnosis, definitive treatment, and improved outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, and to facilitate international clinical research collaboration. We convened an international panel of multidisciplinary experts including physicians with expertise in HSCT, paediatric intensive care, nephrology, hepatology, radiology, pathology, and transfusion medicine; HSCT advanced-practice providers and medical trainees; pharmacists; and translational and basic science researchers from the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Network, the EBMT, the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortia, and several other institutions with extensive experience in sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. Panellists convened at The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) in February, 2019, to evaluate the available evidence. In this expert position statement paper, we provide consensus recommendations for the international implementation of guidelines for the diagnosis, severity grading, and treatment of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome among children, adolescents, and young adults. We endorse universal adoption of paediatric diagnostic guidelines for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome as proposed by the EBMT, and provide implementation guidance for standardisation across centres; we have further proposed adjunctive use of age-appropriate organ-specific toxicity criteria for severity grading and provided prophylaxis and treatment considerations among children and adolescent and young adult patients. Key recommendations include: (1) liver biopsy, portal venous wedge pressure, and reversal of portal venous flow on Doppler ultrasonography should not be used for the routine diagnosis of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome in children, adolescents, and young adults; (2) platelet refractoriness can be defined as a corrected count increment of less than 5000-7500 following at least two sequential ABO-compatible fresh platelet transfusions; (3) hepatomegaly is best defined as an absolute increase of at least 1 cm in liver length at the midclavicular line; and if a baseline measurement is not available, hepatomegaly can be defined as greater than 2 SDs above normal for age; and (4) the presence and volume of ascites can be categorised as mild (minimal fluid by liver, spleen, or pelvis), moderate (<1 cm fluid), or severe (fluid in all three regions with >1 cm fluid in at least two regions)."
41550731,Widely targeted metabolomics and machine learning identify succinate as a key metabolite in sepsis-associated encephalopathy.,2026,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment. We used widely targeted LC-MS/MS plasma metabolomics in 29 healthy controls, 32 sepsis patients, and 27 SAE patients, combined with machine learning, to define metabolic patterns across these groups. This approach identified 12 discriminatory metabolites, with succinate showing a stepwise increase from health to sepsis to SAE and associations with clinical severity scores. To test its functional relevance, we used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model and found that exogenous succinate supplementation aggravated cognitive deficits, neuronal injury, and microglial activation. Together, these findings link systemic metabolic remodeling to brain inflammation and dysfunction in sepsis and suggest that succinate and related pathways may help stratify SAE risk and provide mechanistic entry points for future therapeutic exploration."
15671735,Prospective studies of Bartonella of rodents. Part I. Demographic and temporal patterns in population dynamics.,2004,"The temporal dynamics of Bartonella infections in a rodent community were described by repeatedly capturing and sampling individual animals. Among six rodent species, from which bartonellae were isolated, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) accounted for > 98% of the bacteremic animals. All cotton rats captured four or more times were Bartonella-culture positive at least once. The lowest monthly prevalence of Bartonella in cotton rats was in June (49%) and the highest was in October (95%). Prevalence of Bartonella infection increased to > 90% among juvenile and subadult rats before declining to < 40% among the largest-oldest individuals. Bacteremia levels ranged between 40 and 4.0 x 10(6) colony forming units (CFU) per 1 mL of blood. Male cotton rats had significantly higher CFUs than females (p = 0.006). The median of Bartonella bacteremia decreased monotonically by age group among cotton rats. Although Bartonella infections were highly prevalent among cotton rats, only 8.5% of rats had reactive antibodies at titers of > or = 1:32 and none had antibodies titers of > 1:256."
25744046,[Septic shock and necrotizing fasciitis due to Aeromonas hydrophila after chemotherapy in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma accompanied by liver cirrhosis].,2014,"A 78-year-old man with liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital because of persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Colonoscopy revealed erosions and submucosal tumors in portions of the sigmoid colon and rectum, which were diagnosed as mantle cell lymphoma with biopsy. After chemotherapy consisting of vincristine and prednisone, he developed Aeromonas hydrophila septicemia, resulting in septic shock and necrotizing fasciitis despite prescribing antimicrobial agents to which this organism was susceptible. Whenever we intend to treat patients with hematological malignancies and an underlying chronic liver disease, we must keep this bacterium in mind."
25664016,Direct bilirubin as a prognostic biomarker in enteric fistula patients complicated with sepsis: a case-control study.,2014,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of serial bilirubin determinations for mortality in enteric fistula (EF) patients complicated with sepsis. METHODS: From January 1st, 2012 to January 13rd, 2013, a prospective study enrolling 162 patients was performed. Patients were divided into the survivors group (n = 119) and non-survivors group (n = 43) according to 28-day outcomes. Laboratory variables on day 0, day 3 and day 7 after admission were recorded. DB0 was defined as serum direct bilirubin (DB) value in admission, while DeltaDB3 as the changes from DB3 to DB0. The definition applied to other parameters. The results were validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients. RESULTS: Compared with survivors, non-survivors had significantly higher DB7 (23.1 +/- 10.6 vs. 11.2 +/- 1.1, P < 0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT7) (5.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.3 P = 0.006). ROC analysis showed that DB7 > 12.8 mumol/L and DeltaDB7 > 7.3 mumol/L were reliable predictors (DB7: 86.4% sensitivity, 88.6% specificity (area under the curve (AUC): 0.881, P < 0.001; DeltaDB7: 84.4% sensitivity, 85.1% specificity, AUC: 0.865, P < 0.001) for mortality.The combination form (DB7 > 12.8 mumol/L + DeltaPCT7 < 5.3 ng/ml) had greatest predictive value (AUC: 0.894, P < 0.001). Their predictive values were confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Serum direct bilirubin was a reliable predictor for mortality in enteric fistula patients, which should be paid close attention in the critical care."
41523449,"A Life-Threatening Case of Severe Leptospirosis in Wales, UK: Recognising Severe Disease in Non-endemic Settings.",2025,"Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that is uncommonly seen in the United Kingdom. It is typically associated with occupational exposure among sewage workers, farmers, veterinarians and abattoir employees. The illness is known by other terms such as seven-day fever, haemorrhagic fever and Weil's disease. The prevalence of leptospirosis outside of the United Kingdom is well documented, however it remains relatively uncommon to be encountered in hospitals inside the UK. While the majority of cases encountered are mild, severe disease with jaundice and acute renal failure has been described, highlighting the importance of clinician awareness in non-endemic settings.  We summarise the case of a 54-year-old male with a two-week history of malaise, fevers and oliguria who was initially treated for sepsis of unknown origin. The patient rapidly deteriorated and was admitted to ITU for haemofiltration whilst further investigations took place to establish a diagnosis."
41464553,Prognostic Value of 48-h Biomarker Changes in Sepsis Mortality.,2025,"Background: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Although various scoring systems and biomarkers have been studied, the prognostic significance of early dynamic changes in laboratory parameters remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of 48 h changes in routinely monitored biomarkers for in-hospital mortality in septic patients. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted in the Anesthesiology and Reanimation ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital. A total of 174 adult patients (>/=18 years) diagnosed with sepsis according to SEPSIS-3 criteria between January 2017 and December 2022 were included. Laboratory data were recorded at ICU admission and after 48 h. Patients who died within 48 h or had missing follow-up data were excluded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression models were used to assess the prognostic performance of clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: The median age was 71 years, and 58% of patients were male. Comorbidities were present in 76% patients, and malignancy was associated with higher mortality (p = 0.012). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 58.6%. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy significantly increased mortality risk (p = 0.001). Non-survivors had higher baseline SOFA and APACHE II scores. At 48 h, mortality was associated with increased procalcitonin, lactate, and CRP/albumin ratio and greater albumin decline. ROC analysis identified procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, albumin > 7% decrease, and CRP/albumin ratio > 31% increase as optimal cutoffs. Multivariate analysis revealed SOFA score > 6, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, procalcitonin </= 28% decrease, lactate > 23% increase, and platelet > 37% decrease as independent mortality predictors. The change in albumin level was included in the model but was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Forty-eight-hour biomarker changes, particularly in lactate and platelet count, may provide complementary prognostic information to baseline SOFA scores and may support early risk stratification in sepsis. These findings should be considered exploratory and require confirmation in prospective multicenter studies before clinical implementation."
15660580,Ultrapure dialysate.,2004,"To prevent pyrogenic reactions during hemodialysis, it is recommended that bacteria and endotoxin in dialysate not exceed 100-200 colony forming units (CFU)/ml and 0.25-2 endotoxin units (EU)/ml, respectively. While these limits are adequate to prevent acute pyrogenic reactions, data are accumulating to suggest they may not prevent stimulation of chronic inflammation in hemodialysis patients. Fragments of endotoxin and other bacterial products capable of stimulating immune cells cross low-flux and high-flux membranes in vitro. In clinical studies, use of ultrapure dialysate (bacteria < 0.1 CFU/ml and endotoxin < 0.03 EU/ml) is associated with lower concentrations of inflammatory markers and acute phase reactants than are observed with dialysate meeting current quality recommendations. Moreover, observational studies suggest a link between clinical outcomes and dialysate purity. Treatment of patients with ultrapure dialysate is reported to improve nutritional status, increase responsiveness to erythropoietin, slow the decline in residual renal function, lessen cardiovascular morbidity, and decrease the incidence of beta(2)-microglobulin amyloidosis. To date, however, none of these studies has shown a cause-and-effect relationship between dialysate purity and outcome. Further, there are no data defining the concentration dependence of outcomes on dialysate purity and the relative importance of dialysate purity as a trigger of inflammation remains unclear. While the technology exists to routinely provide ultrapure dialysate, controlled clinical trials are still needed to answer the question of whether or not introducing ultrapure dialysate into routine clinical practice represents an efficient use of limited resources in terms of decreasing inflammation and improving outcomes in hemodialysis patients."
41537291,Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage versus surgical resection for the treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2025,"&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Colonic diverticular disease (diverticulosis) is a currently worldwide increasing gastrointestinal disorder with a particularly high prevalence in Western countries. The operative treatment of acute diverticulitis could be executed through open or laparoscopic techniques. A non-resectional procedure, namely laparoscopic peritoneal lavage (LPL) and drainage, has also been adopted as a less invasive treatment strategy to treat patients with diverticular perforation and purulent peritonitis.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The present work was conducted to pool the currently available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of LPL for the treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis.&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The analysis included studies that compared patients who underwent LPL to those who underwent surgical resection. Fifteen articles were eligible for this review after searching the Scopus, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The meta-analysis demonstrated that operative time and blood loss were significantly lower in the LPL group (p&lt;0.001). The rates of overall morbidity and reoperation were comparable in the two groups (p = 0.57 and 0.74, respectively). There were significantly lower rates of cardiovascular (p &lt; 0.001) and respiratory complications (p = 0.01), incisional/parastomal hernia formation (p = 0.02), ICU admission (p &lt; 0.001), length of hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001), permanent stoma formation (p &lt; 0.001), and mortality (p &lt; 0.001), and higher rates of sepsis (p = 0.03), intra-abdominal abscess formation (p &lt; 0.001), and postoperative recurrence (p &lt; 0.001) in the LPL group.&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Compared to the colon resection procedures for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis, laparoscopic peritoneal lavage had comparable overall morbidity and reoperation rates and lower rates of permanent stoma formation and mortality. Still, there is concern regarding the recurrence and intra-abdominal abscess formation."
31908697,Percutaneous cholecystostomy in the management of acute cholecystitis - 10 years of experience.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: The preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis is cholecystectomy, but for patients with precluded general anesthesia due to critical illness or multiple medical comorbidities it is not suitable. Cholecystostomy could be a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative. AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the indications, technical features, efficacy, complications, patients' development and relationships among monitored parameters of percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided cholecystostomies in cases of acute cholecystitis and find the role of this procedure in appropriate treatment selection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the course of 10 years, 75 percutaneous cholecystostomy procedures in 69 patients were performed in cases with diagnosed acute cholecystitis, precluded general anesthesia and contraindicated cholecystectomy by an experienced surgeon and anesthesiologist. These interventions were done using only local anesthesia. The patients were men in 39 cases and women in 33 cases, aged 33 to 91 years. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all cases. The indications were sepsis in 34 (45.3%) cases, bridging acute gallbladder inflammatory status in 15 (20%) interventions, serious medical comorbidities in 8 (10.7%) cases, disseminated malignancy and cardiac failure in 6 cases each (both 8%) and neurological affections in 5 (6.5%) cases. Cholecystostomy was frequently the final solution in acalculous cholecystitis (79.3%). The 30-day mortality rate was determined at 10.7% and the overall complication rate was 21.3%, but all of these complications were managed conservatively or using minimally invasive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous CT-guided cholecystostomy is reserved for patients with a serious medical status for various reasons that preclude surgical treatment and general anesthesia. Simultaneously, technical success and efficacy are high and the complication rate is acceptable."
20013569,Cardiogenic shock in a neonate with enterovirus myocarditis.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular compromise in the neonate may be caused by birth asphyxia, metabolic disease, congenital heart disease, and systemic bacterial or viral infections. In rare cases, enterovirus infection may cause severe disease including cardiac, cerebral, hepatic and multi organ failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 3-week-old neonate was admitted to our NICU in cardiogenic shock and severe lactic acidosis (ph: 6.9; serum lactate: 15 mmol/l, base excess: -19.8 mmol/l; pCO (2): 54.9 mm Hg). Serum troponin T was within the normal range; serum total creatinin phosphokinase was 57 U/l, CK-MB 110 U/l, LDH 762 U/l; pro-BNP: 64391 pg/ml was elevated. On echocardiography left ventricular function was depressed with a shortening fraction of 16%. The neonate was started on inotropes. There was gradual improvement over the following two weeks with normalisation of left ventricular output. PCR examination was positive for enterovirus. Other causes for left ventricular compromise (congenital heart disease, inborn errors of metabolism, etc.) were ruled out by adequate means. CONCLUSIONS: Enterovirus infection as a cause for myocarditis and cardiogenic shock should be taken into the differential diagnosis in neonates."
32074091,Endocan serum concentration in uninfected newborn infants.,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Endocan is a specific endothelial mediator involved in the inflammatory response. Its role in the diagnosis of sepsis has been studied in adult patients and late onset neonatal sepsis. The clinical signs of early onset sepsis (EOS) are nonspecific and routinely used biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have low sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Endocan could be useful as a biomarker for diagnosis of EOS, but at present normal range values for this molecule have not been reported. The aim of this study is to establish the normal values range for serum endocan in term and preterm newborns without risk factors for EOS and to characterize the variation pattern of its levels at different postnatal moments. METHODOLOGY: Mean endocan serum concentration (ESC) was measured in term and preterm newborns without clinical suspicion of EOS at different moments from birth. RESULTS: ESC (ng/mL) in term newborns was 1.74+/-0.13 on day 1 and 2.02+/-0.41 on day 3 respectively, (p=0.09). In preterm newborns ESC (ng/mL) was 2.02+/-0.11 and 1.97+/-0.18, (p=0.8) for day 1 and 3 respectively. ESC was not significantly influenced by sex, mode of delivery, evidence of fetal distress or presence of minor birth trauma. CONCLUSIONS: ESC (ng/mL) between the first and third day of life in either term or preterm infants don't appear to be significantly influenced by factors that are associated with elevation of inflammatory markers, thus using this biomarker for the diagnosis of EOS might reduce the false positive results."
41624862,Immune signatures of sepsis from mild infection to critical illness - a prospective observational study.,2025,"Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is a phenomenon characterized by the development of several changes in immunophenotype which predispose to secondary infections and increased mortality risk. Immunomodulatory therapies have yet to reproducibly demonstrate benefit in large clinical trials. We propose that several changes consistent with an immunosuppressive phenotype in sepsis represent either adaptive changes or epiphenomenon, rather than direct drivers of outcome in infection and sepsis. We therefore conducted a prospective observational study of patients presenting with infections with a spectrum of illness severity, to evaluate canonical features of monocyte and lymphocyte immunosuppression using flow cytometry. Several features consistent with immunosuppression in sepsis are observed in mild infections and non-infectious acute conditions. These features may be better understood as markers along a continuum of illness severity rather than distinct features of critical illness. Monocyte HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), and an increase in soluble PD-L1, discriminate between critically ill patients, patients with mild infection, and patients with non-infectious illness. In contrast, CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte phenotype did not discriminate between patient groups. Immunotherapies targeting lymphocyte function may only be effective if simultaneously augmenting monocyte antigen presentation and co-stimulatory pathways. Combination immunotherapy in sepsis requires evaluation."
20028533,Diagnostic and prognostic value of procalcitonin among febrile critically ill patients with prolonged ICU stay.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed as a diagnostic and prognostic sepsis marker, but has never been validated in febrile patients with prolonged ICU stay. METHODS: Patients were included in the study provided they were hospitalised in the ICU for > 10 days, were free of infection and presented a new episode of SIRS, with fever >38 degrees C being obligatory. Fifty patients fulfilled the above criteria. PCT was measured daily during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was proven infection. RESULTS: Twenty-seven out of 50 patients were diagnosed with infection. Median PCT on the day of fever was 1.18 and 0.17 ng/ml for patients with and without proven infections (p < 0.001). The area under the curve for PCT was 0.85 (95% CI; 0.71-0.93), for CRP 0.65 (0.46-0.78) and for WBC 0.68 (0.49-0.81). A PCT level of 1 ng/mL yielded a negative predictive value of 72% for the presence of infection, while a PCT of 1.16 had a specificity of 100%. A two-fold increase of PCT between fever onset and the previous day was associated with proven infection (p 0.001) (OR = 8.55; 2.4-31.1), whereas a four-fold increase of PCT of any of the 6 preceding days was associated with a positive predictive value exceeding 69.65%. A PCT value less than 0.5 ng/ml on the third day after the advent of fever was associated with favorable survival (p 0.01). CONCLUSION: The reported data support that serial serum PCT may be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker in febrile chronic critically ill patients."
20184126,[Open vs. laparoscopic loop ileostomy clousure after colorectal surgery: retrospective analysis].,2009,"INTRODUCTION: A protective loop ileostomy for a distal anastomosis of the rectum or anus, decreases the risk of sepsis secondary to anastomotic leak or dehiscence. This study examines whether the surgical technique employed in the construction of the anastomosis (open vs. laparoscopic) alters the subsequent closure of ileostomy. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to determine whether at the time of a protective ileostomy closure, the fact of doing an initial laparoscopic surgery has advantages over those who underwent open surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a comparative and retrospective analysis of the results of an ileostomy closure with prior open surgery (ICPOS) vs those performed with a prior laparoscopic surgery (ICPLS). Demographic and surgical results were analyzed. Fisher's test and Chi square tests were used. A statistically significant results was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were included: 42 (59.2%) ICPOS and 29 (40.8%) ICPLS. Surgical time and hospital stay were less in the ICPLS group when compared with the ICPOS group. 79 vs. 133 min (p = 0.0001) and 3 vs. 5 days (p = 0.0001). Four patients (66.7%) from the ICPOS group developed ileum, whereas only 2 (33.3% from the ICPLS presented it (p = 0.04). Six patients had surgical wound infection, 5 (83.3%) of them represented the ICPOS group and only 1 (16.7%) represented the ICPLS group (p = 0.01). Four patients (5.6%) had anastomotic dehiscence, all of them were from the ICPOS group (p = 0.0037). On the ICPOS group 6 patients were reinterveined after the ileostomy closure, whereas none from the ICPLS required it (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An ICPLS seems to have advantages over a ICPOS when analyzing surgical time, hospital stay and surgical ileum development, a lesser infection rate and a lesser re intervention rate at last."
41423760,Group A Streptococcus: A Re-Emerging Pathogen? Two Autopsy Cases of Deadly Infections in Previously Undiagnosed Young Adult Males.,2025,"Streptococcus pyogenes [group A strep (GAS)] is not a novel pathogen, but it is a newly emerging deadly threat. Recent data suggests that GAS, like many other contagions, saw a rise in infections in 2022, likely due to the withdrawal of COVID-19 precautions. GAS can present as a localized infection, namely tonsillopharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and scarlet fever, or as an invasive infection such as meningitis, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and puerperal sepsis. Even though GAS tonsillopharyngitis is not typically fatal, it can be complicated by acute rheumatic fever if antibiotics are not administered promptly. Though the prevalence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its sequelae, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), has declined over the last half-century in Europe and North America, ARF and RHD both remain some of the most significant contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among socially and economically disadvantaged populations globally. Here we present 2 cases of fatal invasive GAS infections in previously healthy young adult males, with diagnoses made postmortem due to a lack of clinical recognition prior to death."
32999504,A Case of Antibiotic-Induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.,2020,"Purpose: To report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a 75 year-old patient who was taking concomitant ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Method: Case report Results: A patient had been prescribed ciprofloxacin and metronidazole during a recent hospitalization and continued this regimen outpatient. Two weeks after discharge and 3 weeks after initiation of her regimen, she was brought to the emergency department after developing acute weakness and lightheadedness. After admission, the patient declined more rapidly and began seizing with subsequent intubation. Initial computed tomographic (CT) imaging showed no acute neurological abnormalities, and a sepsis workup was initiated. After negative CT, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed that showed a T2 flair and hyperdensity consistent with PRES. The final diagnosis was considered to be PRES secondary to ciprofloxacin/metronidazole utilization. Conclusion: Antibiotic induced PRES is a condition that needs to be explored more thoroughly."
19996337,Pneumococcal pneumonia presenting with septic shock: host- and pathogen-related factors and outcomes.,2010,"BACKGROUND: Host- and pathogen-related factors associated with septic shock in pneumococcal pneumonia are not well defined. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for septic shock and to ascertain patient outcomes. Serotypes, genotypes and antibiotic resistance of isolated strains were also analysed. METHODS: Observational analysis of a prospective cohort of non-severely immunosuppressed hospitalised adults with pneumococcal pneumonia. Septic shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg and peripheral hypoperfusion with the need for vasopressors for >4 h after fluid replacement. RESULTS: 1041 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia diagnosed by Gram stain and culture of appropriate samples and/or urine antigen test were documented, of whom 114 (10.9%) had septic shock at admission. After adjustment, independent risk factors for shock were current tobacco smoking (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.34; p = 0.044), chronic corticosteroid treatment (OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 1.75 to 11.32; p = 0.002) and serotype 3 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.475; p = 0.022). No significant differences were found in genotypes and rates of antibiotic resistance. Compared with the remaining patients, patients with septic shock required mechanical ventilation more frequently (37% vs 4%; p<0.001) and had longer length of stay (11 vs 8 days; p<0.001). The early (10% vs 1%; p<0.001) and overall case fatality rates (25% vs 5%; p<0.001) were higher in patients with shock. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock is a frequent complication of pneumococcal pneumonia and causes high morbidity and mortality. Current tobacco smoking, chronic corticosteroid treatment and infection caused by serotype 3 are independent risk factors for this complication."
15633102,Late treatment with a protective antigen-directed monoclonal antibody improves hemodynamic function and survival in a lethal toxin-infused rat model of anthrax sepsis.,2005,"BACKGROUND: In animal models, treatment with 5H3, a fully human protective antigen-directed monoclonal antibody (PA-MAb), improved survival when administered close to the time of Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LeTx) bolus or live bacterial challenge. However, treatment with PA-MAb would be most valuable clinically if it were beneficial even when administered after the onset of shock and lethality due to LeTx. METHODS: We investigated the effects of PA-MAb versus placebo administered in rats (n=324) at the time of or 3, 6, 9, or 12 h after the initiation of a 24-h LeTx infusion. RESULTS: In rats receiving placebo, mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) were decreased in nonsurvivors, compared with those in survivors, at 6 h and then worsened further, with lethality first evident at 8 h (median, 16 h; range, 8-152 h). At each treatment time, survival rates were greater for PA-MAb than for placebo, although improvement was decreased at later treatment times (P=.001, for the effect of time). Compared with placebo, PA-MAb significantly increased MBP during the 12 h after the initiation of treatment, but the increase was greatest for treatment at 3 h; similarly, PA-MAb significantly increased HR at all treatment times. CONCLUSION: In this rat model, improvements in outcome due to PA-MAb were significant when it was administered up to 6 h (and approached significance when administered up to 12 h) after initial exposure to LeTx. Clinically, PA-MAb may be beneficial even when administered after the onset of shock and lethality due to LeTx."
25553245,Discrimination of sepsis stage metabolic profiles with an LC/MS-MS-based metabolomics approach.,2014,"BACKGROUND: To identify metabolic biomarkers that can be used to differentiate sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), assess severity and predict outcomes. METHODS: 65 patients were involved in this study, including 35 patients with sepsis, 15 patients with SIRS and 15 normal patients. Small metabolites that were present in patient serum samples were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry techniques and analysed using multivariate statistical methods. RESULTS: The metabolic profiling of normal patients and patients with SIRS or sepsis was markedly different. A significant decrease in the levels of lactitol dehydrate and S-phenyl-d-cysteine and an increase in the levels of S-(3-methylbutanoyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E and N-nonanoyl glycine were observed in patients with sepsis in comparison to patients with SIRS (p<0.05). Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock displayed lower levels of glyceryl-phosphoryl-ethanolamine, Ne, Ne dimethyllysine, phenylacetamide and d-cysteine (p<0.05) in their sera. The profiles of patients with sepsis 48 h before death illustrated an obvious state of metabolic disorder, such that S-(3-methylbutanoyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E, phosphatidylglycerol (22:2 (13Z, 16Z)/0:0), glycerophosphocholine and S-succinyl glutathione were significantly decreased (p<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve of the differential expression of these metabolites was also performed. CONCLUSIONS: The body produces significant evidence of metabolic disorder during SIRS or sepsis. Seven metabolites may potentially be used to diagnose sepsis.

31911908,Pneumococcal infection transmission between family members with congenital asplenia: A case report.,2019,"BACKGROUND: Asplenia, the lack of a spleen, can be congenital and increases susceptibility to severe infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). We report two cases of severe pneumococcal infection in two asplenic family members living in the same household. CASE SUMMARY: Patient 1, a 38-year-old man with a history of congenital hepatitis B infection and hypospadias, was brought to our emergency department with complaints of cyanosis, cough, and edema of his limbs. He was clinically diagnosed as hyposplenic with overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and was administered antibiotics and catecholaminergic therapy but died 2 h after admission. Patient 2, a 63-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, was brought to our emergency department one month after admission of Patient 1. She was diagnosed as asplenic with overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. History-taking revealed that she was the mother of Patient 1 and the two had lived in the same household. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and was rapidly provided antibiotics and catecholaminergic intervention but died one day after admission. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal bacteremia caused by virulent S. pneumoniae may be transmitted within households. All residents of households where individuals with pneumococcal bacteremia are living should be educated about the risk of transmissibility. Family members of patients with congenital asplenia/hyposplenia, all family members should be examined to assess their splenic function."
15654426,Effect of the Aedes fluviatilis saliva on the development of Plasmodium gallinaceum infection in Gallus (gallus) domesticus.,2004,"Effect of Aedes fluviatilis saliva on the development of Plasmodium gallinaceum experimental infection in Gallus (gallus) domesticus was studied in distinct aspects. Chickens subcutaneously infected with sporozoites in the presence of the mosquito salivary gland homogenates (SGH) showed higher levels of parasitaemia when compared to those ones that received only the sporozoites. However, the parasitaemia levels were lower among chickens previously immunized by SGH or non-infected mosquito bites compared to the controls, which did not receive saliva. High levels of anti-saliva antibodies were observed in those immunized chickens. Moreover, 53 and 102 kDa saliva proteins were recognized by sera from immunized chickens. After the sporozoite challenge, the chickens also showed significant levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies. However, the ability to generate anti-sporozoites antibodies was not correlated to the saliva immunization. Our results suggest that mosquito saliva components enhance P. gallinaceum parasite development in naive chickens. However, the prior exposure of chickens to salivary components controls the parasitemia levels in infected individuals."
25676045,Extracorporeal virus elimination for the treatment of severe Ebola virus disease--first experience with lectin affinity plasmapheresis.,2014,"Therapeutic options for Ebola virus disease (EVD) are currently limited to (1) best supportive care, and (2) evolving virus-specific therapies, resulting from decades of analyzing one of the world's deadliest diseases. Supportive care ranges from oral or intravenous rehydration therapy and anti-emetics in developing countries to much more extensive life-support interventions in resource-rich countries. Current EVD-specific therapies attempt to either interfere with the earliest steps of viral replication or to elicit a strong immune response against the virus. An entirely new approach is the extracorporeal elimination of viruses and viral glycoproteins by lectin affinity plasmapheresis. Herein, we report for the first time the successful and safe use of lectin affinity plasmapheresis in a patient with severe Ebola virus disease."
25505140,Bacteremia and malaria in Tanzanian children hospitalized for acute febrile illness.,2015,"We recorded the reason for presentation to a rural hospital in an area endemic for malaria in 909 children between January 2006 and March 2009. Blood smears were examined for Plasmodium falciparum parasites, and blood spots dried on filter paper were prepared for 464 children. A PCR assay utilizing the stored blood spots was developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae (lytA) and Haemophilus influenzae (pal). Malaria was present in 299 children whose blood was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 19 had lytA and 15 had pal. The overall prevalence of lytA was 25 of the 464 children, while that of pal was 18 children. Fever was present in 369 children of whom 19 had lytA DNA while 11 had pal DNA detected. Of the 95 afebrile children, six had lytA and seven pal. We conclude that there are no clinical features that distinguish malaria alone from bacteremia alone or the presence of both infections."
31946228,Detection of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Incorporation of Label Uncertainty and Partially Available Privileged Information.,2019,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fulminant inflammatory lung injury that develops in patients with critical illnesses including sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma. However, many patients with ARDS are not recognized when they develop this syndrome nor given outcome-improving treatments. Because ARDS is a clinical syndrome, physicians may not be certain about a patient's diagnosis (label uncertainty). In addition, the diagnosis requires a chest x-ray, which may not be always be available in a clinical setting (privileged information). For this paper, we implemented the Learning Using Label Uncertainty and Partially Available Privileged Information (LULUPAPI) paradigm, built on classical SVM, to detect ARDS using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and chest radiography. In comparison to SVM, this resulted in a 3.55 percent improvement of test AUC."
31832876,Antibacterial effect of fosfomycin tromethamine on the bacteria inside urinary infection stones.,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the antibacterial effect of fosfomycin tromethamine (FT) on the bacteria inside urinary infection stones. METHODS: The internal structures of urinary stones were observed via scanning electron microscopy to verify the presence of internal bacteria. We randomly assigned equal numbers of patients with kidney stones who met the inclusion criteria into two groups in a prospective study and treated them with different perioperative antibiotics. One group (experimental group) was treated with FT, and the other (control group) was treated with cefuroxime sodium. All stone specimens were collected via percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The primary infection stones were screened via a stone component analysis, 30 cases in the experimental group and 31 cases in the control group. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometry was used to measure the drug concentration inside the stones, the bacterial count was calculated via stone culture, and the clinical infection index were monitored for between-group comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the experimental group had a higher internal drug concentration, a higher drug sensitivity against various pathogenic bacteria, a lower bacterial colony count in the stone culture, and a lower incidence of postoperative clinical infection. CONCLUSIONS: FT is more effective than cefuroxime, which is commonly used during the perioperative period of urinary stones, and exerts a high antibacterial effect on these internal bacteria, and effectively reduces the probability of infection and sepsis after urinary stone surgery. FT can be used as an antibiotic during the perioperative period of urinary stones."
41477006,"Clinical, genomic, and functional characterization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci from immunocompromised patients: insights into epithelial dysfunction and bloodstream infections.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) are increasingly recognized as major opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients, where they may cause bloodstream infections (BSIs). The present study aimed to characterize a cohort of immunocompromised patients colonized or infected with VRE, performing genomic analysis of these isolates. Additionally, we investigated the impact of bacterial culture supernatants on Caco-2 epithelial cells, focusing on adhesion and cytotoxicity to elucidate mechanisms related to epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 46 VRE from two Italian hospitals. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected, and isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. Four representative isolates (E. faecium ST80, E. faecium ST117, E. faecalis ST28, and E. faecalis ST179) and two reference strains (ATCC 29212 and ATCC 51299) were selected for in vitro analyses. Adhesion to Caco-2 monolayers was quantified, while cytotoxicity was assessed using MTT assays with bacterial cell-free supernatants (CS). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production was measured using the Amplex((R)) Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were E. faecium (78.3%), predominantly ST80 and ST117, possessed multiple resistance determinants. E. faecalis isolates displayed greater sequence type diversity with a ST28 predominance, carrying virulence genes as ebp, gelE, and elrA. In vitro, bloodstream-derived isolates (E. faecium 51, E. faecalis 52) and reference strain ATCC 29212 adhered more strongly to Caco-2 cells than other isolates. CS from invasive isolates and ATCC 51299 significantly reduced epithelial cell viability at 24 h (p < 0.01). In these isolates, H(2)O(2) higher quantification was documented in a cellular model. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the convergence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits in VRE, alongside functional evidence of strain-dependent adhesion and secretion of cytotoxic metabolites. Elevated H(2)O(2) production provides a possible path between enterococcal secretomes and epithelial injury, suggesting oxidative stress as a contributor to epithelial dysfunction and potential translocation. These insights expand current understanding of VRE pathogenesis and point to novel therapeutic approaches aimed at preserving epithelial integrity and mitigating oxidative damage in high-risk patients."
31883200,Characteristics and influence of Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma cultures in amniotic fluid on perinatal outcomes.,2020,"AIM: To investigate the effects of Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma cultured in amniotic fluid on perinatal characteristics in preterm delivery between 22 and 33 weeks of gestation. METHODS: The study was conducted in a tertiary perinatal center and involved 38 pregnant women who had undergone amniocentesis to evaluate intrauterine infection due to preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes. The subjects were divided into three groups based on the culture results: negative (Negative Group, n = 24), positive for Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma (M/U Group, n = 6), and positive for other pathogens (Other Pathogens Group, n = 8). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the three groups. RESULTS: The incidence of histological chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis was significantly different among the three groups (the Negative Group and the Other Pathogens Group, P < 0.01; the M/U Group and the Other Pathogens Group, P = 0.03). In the M/U Group, no infants had sepsis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or poor neurological outcomes, but one infant developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia and needed home oxygen treatment. Although one died of gastrorrhexis, the remaining five patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings and developed normally. CONCLUSION: The presence of Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma isolated from amniotic fluid did not cause neonatal sepsis or poor prognosis. In some infants, there was no histological chorioamnionitis in the placenta. These pathogens thus seem to be less invasive than any other microbes with respect to perinatal outcomes."
31821950,Blood viral load in the diagnostic workup of congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) blood quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the diagnostic workup of congenital CMV (cCMV) infection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine if CMV blood qPCR at the time diagnosis could differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infants according to the recent consensus classification. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of children diagnosed with cCMV infection at CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada, between 2008 and 2016. Cases for whom qPCR was done at baseline (<4 weeks of age) alongside a complete diagnostic workup were included. The association between CMV blood viral load (VL) and clinical severity group was determined. The probability of having moderate to severe symptoms was assessed using univariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis. Median VL was significantly higher among infants with moderate to severely symptomatic disease vs. those asymptomatic or asymptomatic with isolated sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (13 736 vs. 1876 copies/ml, p = 0.004), infants with moderate to severe disease or asymptomatic with isolated SNHL vs. asymptomatic (17 736 vs. 1496 copies/ml, p < 0.001), and in infants with baseline neurological involvement vs. those without (17 317 vs. 2641 copies/ml, p = 0.03). Using logistic regression, an infant would have a >75 % probability of being moderate to severely symptomatic above 18 770 copies/ml, with a threshold of 100 000 copies/ml approaching a 100 % probability. CONCLUSIONS: Our baseline assessment of CMV blood VL suggests that that the level of CMV viremia correlates with symptom severity."
31873877,Implications of faecal ESBL carriers undergoing TRUS-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB): role of screening prior to TRUSPB.,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Modification of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) based on pre-procedure rectal culture results is effective for prevention of infection from fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli strains. This has several implications for service delivery and cost. Our aim was to audit sepsis rates after introduction of ESBL screening and to identify risk factors for FQ resistance in ESBL strains and factors for sepsis risk. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study from 2013 to 2016. TRUSPB patients underwent pre-procedure rectal swabs. ESBL-positive patients received amikacin in addition to ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. Patients filled a formal risk assessment questionnaire prior to biopsy. RESULTS: Sepsis rate after introduction of targeted prophylaxis reduced from 3.1% (2009-2012) to 1.4% (2013-2016). Of 38 ESBL patients, n = 5 (13%) developed severe post-TRUSPB sepsis. Among the FQ-resistant ESBL producers, the sepsis rate was 24%. Predictive factor for FQ resistance in ESBL producers included-antibiotic use in the last 3 months (OR 15). The logistic regression analysis did not identify any significant factor for post-TRUSPB sepsis in ESBL-positive patients once they had received additional prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: In the face of rising TRUSPB sepsis and higher sepsis rates with ESBL carriers despite additional prophylaxis, introduction of a targeted antibiotic prophylaxis prior to TRUSPB sepsis prostate biopsies based on rectal swabs or urine cultures may reduce sepsis rates or clinicians may find themselves leaning towards increasingly performing transperineal biopsies with lower sepsis rates supporting the 'trexit' initiative."
15675205,Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as markers of sepsis and outcome in patients with neurotrauma and subarachnoid haemorrhage.,2004,"This prospective study evaluated serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as markers for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Sixty-two patients were followed for 7 days. Serum PCT and CRP were measured on days 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Seventy-seven per cent of patients with traumatic brain injury and 83% with subarachnoid haemorrhage developed SIRS or sepsis (P=0.75). Baseline PCT and CRP were elevated in 35% and 55% of patients respectively (P=0.03). There was a statistically non-significant step-wise increase in serum PCT levels from no SIRS (0.4+/-0.6 ng/ml) to SIRS (3.05+/-9.3 ng/ml) to sepsis (5.5+/-12.5 ng/ml). A similar trend was noted in baseline PCT in patients with mild (0.06+/-0.9 ng/ml), moderate (0.8+/-0.7 ng/ml) and severe head injury (1.2+/-1.9 ng/ml). Such a gradation was not observed with serum CRP There was a non-significant trend towards baseline PCT being a better marker of hospital mortality compared with baseline CRP (ROC-AUC 0.56 vs 0.31 respectively). This is the first prospective study to document the high incidence of SIRS in neurosurgical patients. In our study, serum PCT appeared to correlate with severity of traumatic brain injury and mortality. However, it could not reliably distinguish between SIRS and sepsis in this cohort. This is in part because baseline PCT elevation seemed to correlate with severity of injury. Only a small proportion of patients developed sepsis, thus necessitating a larger sample size to demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of serum PCT as a marker of sepsis. Further clinical trials with larger sample sizes are required to confirm any potential role of PCT as a sepsis and outcome indicator in patients with head injuries or subarachnoid haemorrhage."
41469355,"SERUM FERRITIN CONTENT AND INCIDENCE AND TYPE OF INFECTIOUS AND INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATIONS IN CHILDREN WITH ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA, RESIDING IN RADIOLOGICALLY CONTAMINATED TERRITORIES OF UKRAINE AFTER THE ChNPP ACCIDENT.",2025,"OBJECTIVE: evaluation of the frequency and type of bacterial fungal complications and outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) taking into account the serum ferritin content in children, residing in radiologically contaminated territories (RCT) of Ukraine after the ChNPP accident. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric ALL patients (n = 146), residing in RCT of Ukraine, were the study subjects within a survey period of 15 years. The ALL diagnosis and distribution of patients by the disease variants were heldaccording to the FAB classification and results of immunophenotyping of the bone marrow blast cells. Chemotherapy(CT) was prescribed according to the BerlinFrankfurtMunster group (BFM) protocols. Patients were examined afterthe remission induction therapy. Incidence and type of the bacterial fungal and toxic complications were assessed.The number of deaths was taken into account depending on the age, ALL variant and serum ferritin (SF) content.Radiation doses to the bone marrow were calculated for the entire period of stay in RCT after the accident.Processing of the obtained materials was carried out using the mathematical statistical methods (Student's andSpearman's correlation coefficients, chi2 Pearson test). RESULTS: Study subjects were distributed according to the ALL variants, namely proB (n = 21, 14.4 %), <<general>>type (n = 97, 66.4 %), preB (n = 12, 8.2 %), and TALL (n = 16, 11.0 %). Three groups were formed taking intoaccount the SF levels: Group I (n = 53) - SF up to 200 ng/ml, Group II (n = 49) - SF from 200 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml,Group III (n = 44) - SF above 500 ng/ml. The blood hemoglobin level and RBC count were decreased along theincrease in SF content (p < 0.05). A direct correlation was found between the SF content and RBC average volume(r = 0.45; small er, Cyrillic < 0.05). Anemia was of a normocytic type. The lowest number of cases with iron overload was among thechildren with preBHLL disease variant (1 out of 12). An inverse correlation was established between the transferrin concentration and average hemoglobin content in RBC (r = 0.6; small er, Cyrillic < 0.05). Sepsis and infections of the anal areawere more often observed in the patients with SF level above 200 ng/ml. The course of pneumonia was complicated in case of SF level above 500 ng/ml. The oral cavity and intestinal mucositis did not depend on SF level.Incidence of the systemic toxic effects after chemotherapy was increased under SF level above 500 ng/ml. The number of deaths in children with SF levels above 500 ng/ml was almost doubled. Most of the deaths occurred in thepatients with proBALL (15 out of 21) and TALL (8 out of 16) disease variants. Fewer children had died having the<<common>> ALL type (14 out of 97, 14.4 %). The number of deaths in case of preBALL variant not depended on SF levels. The <<common>> type and TALL patients having got iron overload died more often. The average radiationdoses to the bone marrow were (4.9 +/- 0.4) mSv and did not affect the remaining parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Iron excess in the body affects the incidence and type of infectious complications both with the outcome of ALL in children, which requires timely diagnosis and preventive measures."
41425931,Metabolomic analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae: uncovering key metabolic pathways.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal infection, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a prevalent cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a major pathogen responsible for illnesses such as meningitis, sepsis, and pharyngitis. The complex etiology of S. pneumoniae infection poses significant challenges in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. METHODS: In this study, twenty serum samples from individuals infected with S. pneumoniae and fifteen serum samples from normal controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify metabolites. Multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were used to identify potential metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was employed to map the metabolic pathways associated with these metabolites. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis of the metabolic profiles of infected individuals and normal controls, we identified 418 metabolites that significantly contributed to the differentiation of group samples. The identified metabolites were categorized into various groups, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, and were enriched in pathways including galactose metabolism, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, the citrate cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. S. pneumoniae infection induced significant variations in the serum metabolome, with activation of metabolic pathways implicated in the immune response. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive and real-time analysis of the metabolic network, elucidating the complex processes that occur following pathogen invasion in the human body. The identification of metabolic biomarkers and enriched pathways lays a foundational framework for research and offers visualizable targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumococcal infections."
25599940,Treatment of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae: suboptimal efficacy of polymyxins.,2015,"Treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections (KPC-EI) remains a challenge. Combined therapy has been proposed as the best choice, but there are no clear data showing which combination therapy is superior. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial regimens for treating KPC-EI. This was a retrospective cohort study of KPC-EI nosocomial infections (based on CDC criteria) between October 2009 and June 2013 at three tertiary Brazilian hospitals. The primary outcomes were the 30-day mortality for all infections and the 30-day mortality for patients with bacteraemia. Risk factors for mortality were evaluated by comparing clinical variables of survivors and nonsurvivors. In this study, 118 patients were included, of whom 78 had bacteraemia. Catheter-related bloodstream infections were the most frequent (43%), followed by urinary tract infections (n = 27, 23%). Monotherapy was used in 57 patients and combined treatment in 61 patients. The most common therapeutic combination was polymyxin plus carbapenem 20 (33%). Multivariate analysis for all infections (n = 118) and for bacteremic infections (n = 78) revealed that renal failure at the end of treatment, use of polymyxin and older age were prognostic factors for mortality. In conclusion, polymyxins showed suboptimal efficacy and combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy."
20130378,Is low birth weight a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection?,2009,"BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is currently the leading cause of congenital infection in 0.2-2.2% of live births worldwide leading to variable serious sequalae. The aim of the study was to determine if low birth weight is an indicator of CMV congenital infection evidenced by detecting CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery. METHODOLOGY: CMV-IgG and IgM antibodies and CMV-DNAemia were assessed in umbilical cord blood of two hundreds newborns, one hundred of whom had birth weight < or = 2700 gram and/or head circumference < or = 32 cm. RESULTS: CMV-IgM was not detected, while CMV-IgG was positive in 80-90% of the two hundreds tested newborns. CMV-DNA was detected in four out of the 200 newborns. One of them was over the adopted weight limit (> 2700 gram). CONCLUSIONS: CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test."
25636935,"HIV DNA loads, plasma residual viraemia and risk of virological rebound in heavily treated, virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients.",2015,"In this single-centre, retrospective study, we analyzed data of 194 patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with <50 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA copies/mL in plasma and 318 HIV RNA/DNA paired samples. By kinetic polymerase chain reaction (kPCR) molecular system analysis, 104 (54%) subjects had undetectable HIV RNA and 90 (46%) had residual viraemia. Median (interquartile range) HIV DNA load was 780 (380-1930) copies/10(6) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and HIV DNA loads were independently associated with residual viraemia (p 0.002). Virological rebound occurred in 29/194 (15%) patients over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 17.5 (13.5-31.5) months. Residual viraemia (p 0.002), but not HIV DNA load, was independently associated with virological rebound."
25502509,The significance of persistent fever in the treatment of suspected bacterial infections among inpatients: a prospective cohort study.,2015,"Antibiotic escalations are frequently guided by fever persistence. Unnecessary antibiotic escalation is associated with resistance induction. We examined whether fever persistence is associated with adverse outcomes among medical inpatients with sepsis. In a single-center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive medical inpatients with suspected or documented bacterial infections. Data were collected on days 0, 2, 4, and 30 days from episode onset. We examined the association between fever persistence at 4 days and 30-day mortality on univariate and multivariate analysis. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (IAET) was defined for patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDIs). Odds ratios (ORs) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 1,621 patients were included. Among patients with MDIs, 38/206 (18.4%) given appropriate empiric therapy had continued fever on day 4, compared to 64/231 (27.7%) of patients receiving IAET, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.93. Fever persistence was not associated with mortality after adjustment for other risk factors. Among patients with presumed sepsis who did not have MDIs, persistent fever was significantly associated with 30-day mortality on a multivariate analysis, adjusted OR 2.77 (95% CI 1.78-4.31). Other risk factors for mortality included older age, nosocomial infections, malignancy, dyspnea, shock, decreased albumin, and elevated creatinine. For patients with MDIs, fever persistence for up to 4 days is a marker of IAET, but is not associated with mortality, and should not, in itself, trigger antibiotic escalation. For patients without MDIs, fever persistence should trigger careful re-evaluation, as it is associated with mortality."
15599161,Management of the critically ill patient with severe acute pancreatitis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: Acute pancreatitis represents a spectrum of disease ranging from a mild, self-limited course requiring only brief hospitalization to a rapidly progressive, fulminant illness resulting in the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with or without accompanying sepsis. The goal of this consensus statement is to provide recommendations regarding the management of the critically ill patient with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: An international consensus conference was held in April 2004 to develop recommendations for the management of the critically ill patient with SAP. Evidence-based recommendations were developed by a jury of ten persons representing surgery, internal medicine, and critical care after conferring with experts and reviewing the pertinent literature to address specific questions concerning the management of patients with severe acute pancreatitis. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were a total of 23 recommendations developed to provide guidance to critical care clinicians caring for the patient with SAP. Topics addressed were as follows. 1) When should the patient admitted with acute pancreatitis be monitored in an ICU or stepdown unit? 2) Should patients with severe acute pancreatitis receive prophylactic antibiotics? 3) What is the optimal mode and timing of nutritional support for the patient with SAP? 4) What are the indications for surgery in acute pancreatitis, what is the optimal timing for intervention, and what are the roles for less invasive approaches including percutaneous drainage and laparoscopy? 5) Under what circumstances should patients with gallstone pancreatitis undergo interventions for clearance of the bile duct? 6) Is there a role for therapy targeting the inflammatory response in the patient with SAP? Some of the recommendations included a recommendation against the routine use of prophylactic systemic antibacterial or antifungal agents in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. The jury also recommended against pancreatic debridement or drainage for sterile necrosis, limiting debridement or drainage to those with infected pancreatic necrosis and/or abscess confirmed by radiologic evidence of gas or results or fine needle aspirate. Furthermore, the jury recommended that whenever possible, operative necrosectomy and/or drainage be delayed at least 2-3 wk to allow for demarcation of the necrotic pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides 23 different recommendations concerning the management of patients with SAP. These recommendations differ in several ways from previous recommendations because of the release of recent data concerning the management of these patients and also because of the focus on the critically ill patient. There are a number of important questions that could not be answered using an evidence-based approach, and areas in need of further research were identified."
25529188,Safety and efficacy of percutaneous cecostomy/colostomy for treatment of large bowel obstruction in adults with cancer.,2015,"PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of image-guided percutaneous cecostomy/colostomy (PC) in the management of colonic obstruction in patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients underwent image-guided PC to relieve large bowel obstruction at a single institution between 2000 and 2012. Colonic obstruction was the common indication. Patient demographics, diagnosis, procedural details, and outcomes including maximum colonic distension (MCD; ie, greatest transverse measurement of the colon on radiograph or scout computed tomography image) were recorded and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Following PC, no patient experienced colonic perforation; pain was relieved in 24 of 27 patients (89%). Catheters with tip position in luminal gas rather than mixed stool/gas or stool were associated with greater decrease in MCD (-40%, -12%, and -16%, respectively), with the difference reaching statistical significance (P = .002 and P = .013, respectively). Catheter size was not associated with change in MCD (P = .978). Catheters were successfully removed from six of nine patients (67%) with functional obstructions and two of 18 patients (11%) with mechanical obstructions. One patient underwent endoscopic stent placement after catheter removal. Three patients required diverting colostomy after PC, and their catheters were removed at the time of surgery. One major complication (3.7%; subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and sepsis) occurred 8 days after PC and was successfully treated with cecostomy exchange, soft-tissue drainage, and intravenous antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Image-guided PC is safe and effective for management of functional and mechanical bowel obstruction in patients with cancer. For optimal efficacy, catheters should terminate within luminal gas."
15640631,The effect of drotrecogin alfa (activated) on long-term survival after severe sepsis.,2004,"OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term survival for subjects with severe sepsis enrolled in the previous multiple-center trial (PROWESS) of drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) vs. placebo. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, blinded follow-up of subjects enrolled in a previous randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: One hundred sixty-four tertiary care institutions in 11 countries. PARTICIPANTS: The 1,690 subjects with severe sepsis enrolled and treated with study drug in PROWESS, of whom 1,220 were alive at 28 days (the end of the original PROWESS follow-up). INTERVENTIONS: DrotAA (n = 850), 24 mug/kg/hr for 96 hrs, or placebo (n = 840). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Long-term survival data were collected. We had follow-up information on 100% of subjects at 28 days, 98% at hospital discharge, 94% at 3 months, and 93% at 1 yr. The longest follow-up was 3.6 yrs. Hospital survival was higher with DrotAA vs. placebo (70.3% vs. 65.1%, p = .03). There was no statistically significant difference in duration of survival time or in landmark survival rates in subjects who received DrotAA compared with those who received placebo (median duration of survival = 1113 days vs. 846 days for DrotAA vs. placebo, p = .10; landmark survival rates for DrotAA vs. placebo, 66.1% vs. 62.4% at 3 months [p = .11], 62.2% vs. 60.3% at 6 months [p = .44], 58.9% vs. 57.2% at 1 yr [p = .49], and 52.6% vs. 49.3% at 2(1/2) yrs [p = .21]). There was a significant interaction (p = .0008) between treatment assignment and baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, suggesting qualitative differences in treatment effect with severity of illness. Subjects with APACHE II >/=25 had better survival time with DrotAA (median duration of survival: 450 vs. 71 days, p =.0005). Survival rates were also higher at landmark time points (DrotAA vs. placebo, 58.9% vs. 48.4% at 3 months [p = .003], 55.2% vs. 45.3% at 6 months [p = .005], 52.1% vs. 41.3% at 1 yr [p = .002], and 45.6% vs. 33.8% at 2(1/2) yrs [p = .001]). In the APACHE II <25 group there was no significant difference in survival time or survival rates at landmark time points except at 1 yr (DrotAA vs. placebo, 65.5% vs. 72.0% at 1 yr, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The acute survival benefit observed in subjects with severe sepsis who received DrotAA persists to hospital discharge. The survival benefit loses statistical significance thereafter. Post hoc analysis suggests the effect of DrotAA varies by APACHE II score with improved long-term survival in subjects with APACHE II scores >/=25 but no benefit in those with lower scores."
16051369,Fusobacterium necrophorum as the cause of recurrent sore throat: comparison of isolates from persistent sore throat syndrome and Lemierre's disease.,2005,"OBJECTIVE: Fusobacterium necrophorum is a well established cause of Lemierre's disease (LD); a syndrome characterised by severe sore throat, septicaemia, multiple abscesses and jugular vein thrombosis. There is no published data concerning the role of F. necrophorum in recurrent sore throats. As the result of an index case of persistent sore throat attributable to this organism being diagnosed in our laboratory, a subsequent case controlled study (not yet published) isolated F. necrophorum from 21% (P=0.0001) of cases of persistent, recurrent and chronic sore throats. The object of this study was to compare isolates of F. necrophorum from cases of systemic disease with isolates from cases of persistent sore throat syndrome (PSTS) to ascertain whether strains of similar type were responsible for both throat and systemic disease or whether different strains were involved in these presentations. METHODS: Throat swabs were cultured on GN anaerobe medium (Oxoid) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days. Seventeen PSTS isolates were identified phenotypically. These were compared to 17 strains isolated from blood cultures which were referred to the Anaerobe Reference Unit, (ARU) cardiff, using enterogenic repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR). The control strains Fusobacterium necrophorum ssp. necrophorum (JCM 3718(T)) and Fusobacterium necrophorum ssp. funduliforme (JCM 3724(T)) from the Japanese Collection of Microrganisms (JCM) were tested in parallel with the clinical isolates. RESULTS: At least 12 separate types were identified. Four of 17 PSTS isolates and seven of 17 blood culture isolates grouped together with the F. necrophorum ssp. funduliforme control strain. There were also similarities between other proposed strains and clinical types but no comparison with the F. necrophorum ssp. necrophorum control. CONCLUSION: These results show that clinical disease caused by F. necrophorum has a wider spectrum than first anticipated. Similar strains are able to cause either chronic local or acute systemic disease suggesting that genetic factors such as those relating to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class may be influencing the outcome of the disease in each patient. Further work is required to produce a more accurate typing scheme and to ascertain the mechanisms of disease caused by this organism. An age correlation between the high risk groups for onset of infectious mononucleosis (IM), peritonsillar abscess (PTA), LD and PSTS has been noted in adolescents and young adults. Further work is required to investigate whether IM is associated with the onset of PTA caused by F. necrophorum which may lead to either PSTS or LD."
20015159,Analysis of humoral immune responses in rhesus macaques vaccinated with attenuated SIVmac239Deltanef and challenged with pathogenic SIVmac251.,2010,"BACKGROUND: To determine the correlation between protection and humoral immune response against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251), 11 macaques were immunized with live-attenuated SIVmac239Deltanef either intravenously or via the tonsils and exposed to SIVmac251 after either 6 or 15 months along with unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: Independent of the route of vaccine application, viremia was significantly reduced in vaccinees compared with controls 2 weeks post-challenge. Concomitantly, viremia correlated inversely with SIV-specific IgG, complement-mediated lysis and neutralizing antibodies and these parameters seemed to contribute to reduced viremia. During chronic infection, six monkeys controlled viremia in the circulation (two or fewer infectious units per 10(6) PBMCs) and showed no signs of trapping in lymphatic tissues (Appendix S1). CONCLUSIONS: As no significant differences were observed throughout the study, with respect to the humoral immune response and viremia control, between the two vaccinated cohorts, mucosal immunization strategies are recommended due to more simplified application."
15691776,Neonatal management of the growth-restricted infant.,2004,"Close collaboration between obstetricians and neonatologists is essential for proper care of the growth-restricted fetus. A joint decision on the appropriate timing of delivery is made, based on the risk of fetal compromise compared with that of neonatal morbidity. A neonatal resuscitative team should be available at delivery. Gestational assessment, anthropological measurements and physical examination are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of intra-uterine growth retardation and establish the symmetric, asymmetric, combined or dysmorphic classification. Neonatal management requires special attention to a number of significant morbidities that growth-restricted infants are more prone to develop compared with normally grown infants, including asphyxia, meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, massive pulmonary haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, polycythaemia-hyperviscosity, intraventricular haemorrhage, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, coagulation abnormalities, and congenital anatomical and genetic abnormalities. Intra-uterine growth retardation is associated with a higher stillbirth rate and infant mortality rate in preterm, term and post-term infants."
20017893,Host immune response in sepsis due to ventilator-associated pneumonia: how is it different?,2009,"Current evidence regarding potentially different host response mechanisms in sepsis according to the type of initiating infection is sporadic. It is possible that alterations in cell populations, variations in effector molecules, and the degree of apoptosis differ between sepsis caused by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-VAP sepsis. VAP is one of the most common infections and leading causes of sepsis in the intensive care unit, and mortality remains high. A better understanding of the unique pathophysiologic features of VAP is needed in order to develop interventions that target those specific pathways."
15606636,Bactec 9240 blood culture system: to preincubate at 35 degrees C or not?,2004,"Bactec Plus blood culture bottles were preincubated at 35 degrees C or at room temperature before entry into the Bactec 9240 instrument to determine the influence of preincubation temperature and time. Of 463 positive blood culture sets, 956 bottles were positive, of which the instrument detected 92.1%. Of 76 positive bottles undetected by the instrument, 68 were preincubated at 35 degrees C and eight at room temperature. The median entry delay and instrument detection times were 17.9 and 7.2 h for preincubated bottles, and 16.4 and 13.4 h for bottles held at room temperature. Short entry delay and inspection before entry into the instrument are necessary if preincubation at 35 degrees C is used."
19954532,Comparison of surveillance methods applied to a situation of low malaria prevalence at rural sites in The Gambia and Guinea Bissau.,2009,"BACKGROUND: Health record-based observations from several parts of Africa indicate a major decline in malaria, but up-to-date information on parasite prevalence in West-Africa is sparse. This study aims to provide parasite prevalence data from three sites in the Gambia and Guinea Bissau, respectively, and compares the usefulness of PCR, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), serology and slide-microscopy for surveillance. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys in 12 villages at three rural sites were carried out in the Gambia and Guinea Bissau in January/February 2008, shortly following the annual transmission season. RESULTS: A surprisingly low microscopically detectable parasite prevalence was detected in the Gambia (Farafenni: 10.9%, CI95%: 8.7-13.1%; Basse: 9.0%, CI95%: 7.2-10.8%), and Guinea Bissau (Caio: 4%, CI95%: 2.6-5.4%), with low parasite densities (geometric mean: 104 parasites/microl, CI95%: 76-143/microl). In comparison, PCR detected a more than three times higher proportion of parasite carriers, indicating its usefulness to sensitively identify foci where malaria declines, whereas the RDT had very low sensitivity. Estimates of force of infection using age sero-conversion rates were equivalent to an EIR of approximately 1 infectious bite/person/year, significantly less than previous estimates. The sero-prevalence profiles suggest a gradual decline of malaria transmission, confirming their usefulness in providing information on longer term trends of transmission. A greater variability in parasite prevalence among villages within a site than between sites was observed with all methods. The fact that serology equally captured the inter-village variability, indicates that the observed heterogeneity represents a stable pattern. CONCLUSION: PCR and serology may be used as complementary tools to survey malaria in areas of declining malaria prevalence such as the Gambia and Guinea Bissau."
20007398,Selection and counterselection of the rtI233V adefovir resistance mutation during antiviral therapy.,2010,"Recently, we reported on three patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for whom adefovir (ADF) therapy virologically failed, most likely due to a preexisting rtI233V HBV polymerase mutation. Here, we describe two further patients with chronic HBV infection who were found to develop the rtI233V mutation after initiation of ADF therapy. These patients represent the first cases known so far in which the rtI233V ADF resistance mutation evolved under persistent HBV replication during HBV therapy with ADF. Interestingly, one of the previously described patients, who was initially successfully switched from ADF to tenofovir (TDF) and became virologically suppressed subsequently, experienced a moderate but remarkable rebound of HBV viremia after switching from TDF to entecavir, due to the emergence of renal toxicity. Thus, we provide evidence for the selection and counterselection of the rtI233V ADF resistance mutation during antiviral therapy."
16295453,Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.,2004,"In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157 adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies."
25542518,Acute kidney injury in septic patients admitted to emergency clinical room: risk factors and outcome.,2015,"PURPOSE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common source of morbidity in sepsis. We sought to determine risk factors for AKI, by acute kidney injury network (AKIN) criteria, in septic patients admitted in emergency clinical room (ER). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 200 patients admitted to the ER of a University Hospital, followed for development of AKI over 5 days. RESULTS: AKI developed in 144/200 (72 %) patients. In multivariable regression analysis, independent risk factors for AKI included age over 65 years (OR 1.28; 95 % CI 1.12-1.89; p = 0.04), mean blood pressure (MBP) lower than 65 mmHg at moment of admission (OR 1.89; 95 % CI 1.43-2.64, p = 0.003) and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.66; 95 % CI 1.30-3.20; p = 0.012). Mortality rate was 51.4 % in AKI patients compared with 26.8 % for those without AKI (p = 0.002). Septic shock (OR = 1.83, 95 % CI 1.23-2.74, p = 0.007), AKIN 3 (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI 1.19-1.89, p = 0.02), APACHE 2 > 20 (OR 1.92, 95 % CI 1.34-2.02, p = 0.009) and need for dialysis (OR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.13-1.75, p = 0.03) were identified as independent risk factors for death in multivariable regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: AKI severity in septic patients admitted in ER is associated with mortality. Diabetes, age over 65 years, and low MBP are independent risk factors for AKI and deserve further study to prevent AKI and, consequently, decreasing mortality."
