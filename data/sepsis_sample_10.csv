41676092,The endothelial activation and stress index as a predictor of 28-day mortality in pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective two-cohort analysis.,2026,"BACKGROUND: The Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) is an emerging biomarker that serves as a straightforward and objective measure of systemic endothelial dysfunction and critical illness severity. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of EASIX for 28-day mortality in patients with pulmonary sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study utilised a two-cohort design. The internal cohort was derived from MIMIC-IV; an external cohort was derived from a tertiary hospital (2022-2025). The association between the EASIX and 28-day mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. An ensemble machine-learning approach (Boruta, LASSO-COX, XGBoost, and SVM) was employed for feature selection. Significant predictors were incorporated into a multivariate Cox model to construct a prognostic nomogram. The model's discriminative performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC), and compared against conventional severity scores. RESULTS: A total of 5,416 patients were analyzed. In multivariable adjusted models, the EASIX emerged as an independent predictor of short term mortality. Each unit increase in EASIX was associated with a 7% higher risk of 28-day ICU death (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.11, p < 0.001). A clear dose-response relationship was observed across EASIX quartiles, with mortality rising from 13.29% (Q1) to 27.92% (Q4); patients in Q4 had nearly twice the mortality risk of those in Q1 (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.60-2.46). RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship. Machine-learning feature selection consistently identified EASIX as a core variable. The final prognostic model, integrating EASIX with five other clinical features, demonstrated stable and superior discriminative ability (AUC 0.67-0.73) compared to traditional severity scores in both internal and external validation. CONCLUSION: EASIX is a potent and independent predictor of short-term mortality in pulmonary sepsis. Its integration into a pragmatic prognostic model enhances early risk stratification, highlighting its potential as a readily available clinical tool."
41676054,Use of LVAD HeartMate 3 and Impella RP in the management of advanced heart failure in an elderly patient: a case report.,2026,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."
41674606,Rapid Detection of Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins in Neonatal Sepsis and Necrotizing Enterocolitis.,2026,"Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIP) are serine protease inhibitors and a reliable inflammatory biomarker. We have demonstrated that IAIP levels decrease during sepsis in humans and animal models. Currently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the standard procedure to measure IAIP levels. We developed a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that allows rapid, point of care detection. We compared IAIP levels in infants with sepsis and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by ELISA and LFIA in a multi-center, cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected from 47 infants with sepsis, 31 sepsis case controls, 52 gestational age (GA)-matched controls and 10 infants with culture-negative sepsis (""clinical sepsis""). We also collected samples from 17 infants with NEC, 7 NEC case controls and 15 GA controls. IAIP levels at presentation of acute events and over the next 72 hours were significantly reduced in infants with sepsis, NEC and culture negative sepsis when compared to controls. IAIP levels did not differ in patients with sepsis or culture negative sepsis. IAIP levels measured by ELISA and LFIA were highly correlated (R (2) = 0.9326) and both showed reliable detection of neonatal sepsis, NEC and culture negative sepsis. IAIP levels were 80.0% sensitive and 92.3% specific using LFIA for the detection of neonatal sepsis. For detection of NEC, IAIP levels were 84.6% sensitive and 86.7% specific."
41674120,Interpreting peripheral oxygen saturation variability in critical illness: A directional framework adjusted for hypoxia severity.,2026,"Peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) exhibits a complex pattern of fluctuations during hypoxia, which can be quantified using entropy measures. SpO2 entropy analysis provides insights into dynamic physiological regulation by non-invasively reflecting the body's capacity to adapt to internal or external physiological challenges. However, the interpretation of SpO2 entropy alone is limited without contextualisation and the degree of physiological challenge encountered (e.g. the severity of hypoxia). This proof-of-concept retrospective study analysed continuous 1 Hz SpO2 recordings extracted from MIMIC-III dataset's Intensive Care Unit ICU patients with sepsis (n = 164), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 58), acute liver failure (ALF) (n = 59), or cirrhosis (n = 169). Sample entropy was computed directly from raw 20-min SpO2 signals and normalised to mean SpO2 using directional parenclitic deviation (delta), derived from a healthy hypoxia-exposure reference dataset. Cox-regression models assessed 30-day ICU mortality. In sepsis, delta was significantly higher in non-survivors (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.20, P < 0.0001) and independently predicted 30-day mortality (HR = 1.79, P < 0.0001). delta was not predictive in the COPD, ALF and cirrhosis cohorts. Unlike other patient groups, the cirrhosis group demonstrated unexpected mean negative delta values, suggesting aberrant regulatory engagement, potentially related to the pathophysiology of hepatopulmonary syndrome. These findings demonstrate that delta provides physiological contexts to entropy-based SpO2 analysis. By linking variability to the severity of hypoxia, this framework enables a more interpretable and a potentially clinically applicable biomarker of systemic regulation in critical illnesses. Future validation across diverse cohorts could support its potential to aid in personalised care within intensive care settings."
41672594,"Phase 1 open-label study of ASP9801, an oncolytic virus, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.",2026,"PURPOSE: ASP9801, an oncolytic virus encoding interleukin-7 and interleukin-12, was assessed for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors in a Phase 1 study. METHODS: The study comprised Part 1 ASP9801 monotherapy dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion with ASP9801 monotherapy or plus pembrolizumab. Each part was divided into Groups A (ASP9801 injection into cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions) and B (ASP9801 injection into visceral lesions). Primary objectives were safety and maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 dose expansion (RP2D); secondary objectives included antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: In dose escalation, 17 and 10 patients in Groups A and B, respectively, received treatment. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; grade 3 cytokine release syndrome) was reported in Group A. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in >/=30% of patients in Group A were pyrexia and in Group B were pyrexia, chills, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and headache. AEs leading to death occurred in two patients in Group A (one each for malignant neoplasm progression and sepsis); neither was attributed to ASP9801. The RP2D of ASP9801 was 5x10(8) plaque-forming unit/mL. In Part 2 dose expansion Group A, 12 patients received monotherapy RP2D, 5 received monotherapy induction, and 2 received ASP9801 plus pembrolizumab. In Group B, 9 and 11 patients received ASP9801 monotherapy or plus pembrolizumab, respectively. One DLT occurred in Group B combination safety cohort (grade 2 pyrexia and mental status change; grade 3 hypoxia, lymphopenia, and pneumonitis). During dose expansion, TRAEs in >/=30% of any cohort (>1 patient) in Group A were nausea, fatigue, chills, pyrexia, and headache and in Group B were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, chills, pyrexia, and lymphocyte count decreased. AEs led to death in two patients in Group A monotherapy and one patient in Group B monotherapy cohorts, all due to malignant neoplasm progression; none were attributed to ASP9801. One patient in Group B combination safety cohort achieved confirmed partial response (objective response rate, 9.1% (95% CI 0.3% to 52.7%)). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ASP9801 alone or plus pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated; however, the study was stopped due to lack of efficacy during dose expansion."
41670654,Procalcitonin kinetics in critically ill children: impact of continuous kidney replacement therapy modality and dose.,2026,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill children, frequently necessitating continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT). Procalcitonin (PCT) is widely used as an infection biomarker, yet its interpretation during CKRT remains unclear. Adult data regarding extracorporeal clearance of PCT are inconsistent, while pediatric evidence is limited. METHODS: In this prospective observational study (May 2021-October 2023), 40 critically ill children receiving CKRT in a tertiary PICU were enrolled. Serum PCT was measured at CKRT initiation (T0), 12 h (T12), and 24 h (T24). CKRT modalities (CVVH, CVVHD, CVVHDF), effluent doses, and membrane types (PS, PAES, AN69-ST) were recorded. PCT kinetics were analyzed using non-parametric tests, with correlation assessed by Spearman's rank. RESULTS: Median baseline PCT was 3.6 ng/mL (IQR 0.5-27.2), rising to 7.4 (0.6-29.5) at T12 and stabilizing at 7.7 (0.6-30.5) at T24. Differences across time points were not statistically significant (p = 0.68). PCT trajectories were unaffected by CKRT modality, effluent dose, or membrane type, and no correlation was found between effluent dose and PCT changes. Stratification by high versus low effluent dosing revealed no significant differences. CKRT-related complications occurred in 17.5%, mainly filter clotting, without influencing PCT. PICU mortality was 35%, reflecting illness severity rather than CKRT. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CKRT, short-term PCT dynamics are driven by the underlying septic or inflammatory process rather than CKRT parameters. PCT typically peaks within 12 h of CKRT initiation and then stabilizes, supporting its reliability for infection monitoring and antibiotic stewardship during early CKRT. Larger studies are warranted to define long-term PCT behavior and prognostic utility."
41669529,Intestinal microenvironment dynamics and Sepsis-associated encephalopathy pathophysiology: insights from multi-omics profiling.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a devastating complication of sepsis, lacks specific biomarkers and clear pathophysiological understanding, particularly regarding the gut-brain axis. While gut dysbiosis is implicated in SAE, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (16S rDNA and fecal miRNA sequencing) to dissect the gut microenvironment in SAE patients (n = 10) compared to sepsis patients without encephalopathy (SP, n = 20). RESULTS: Although alpha- and beta-diversity indices showed no significant differences, distinct compositional shifts in the gut microbiota were observed in SAE patients, characterized by increased abundance of Neisseria, Haemophilus, Lautropia, Enterococcus, Parabacteroides, and decreased Fusobacterium, Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, among others. Concurrently, 12 fecal miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in SAE, with 11 upregulated (e.g., miR-106a-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-30e-3p) and 1 downregulated (miR-222-3p). Crucially, correlation network analysis revealed significant interactions between 10 DE miRNAs and 15 bacterial genera, establishing a complex gut microbiota-miRNA interplay in SAE. Machine learning (LASSO and elastic net regression) identified miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as the most promising combined diagnostic biomarkers, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893. Functional exploration via ceRNA network analysis indicated miR-30e-3p targets inflammation and apoptosis-related genes (e.g., IL1B, RPS6KB1, AKT1), while miR-223-5p primarily targets immune-regulatory genes (e.g., IGF1, AR). Experimental validation confirmed significantly elevated serum IL-1beta levels in SAE patients (p < 0.001), supporting the predicted inflammatory pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of a fecal miRNA-gut microbiota interaction network in SAE pathogenesis, highlighting miR-30e-3p and miR-223-5p as pivotal mediators and potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets."
41669126,"Evaluation of procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in children in Owerri, Nigeria.",2025,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Timely diagnosis remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional blood culture. This study evaluates procalcitonin as a biomarker for bacterial sepsis in children aged 0-59 months in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2023 and February 2024. It involved 298 children aged 0-59 months with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) who were admitted to the Emergency Pediatric Unit and Special Care Baby Unit of Federal Teaching Hospital, Owerri. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured using ELISA, and blood cultures were processed using the BacT/Alert system. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of procalcitonin were compared against blood culture results. RESULTS: Of the 298 children, 142 (47.7%) had culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of serum procalcitonin were 66.9%, 89.7%, 85.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for serum procalcitonin was 0.80 across all age groups which were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin has a good diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial sepsis in children and can complement blood culture in resource-limited settings. Further studies are recommended to explore its application in routine clinical practice."
41668768,Role of DNA methylation in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression in neonates with late-onset sepsis.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major health issue, particularly in resource-poor areas. This study aimed to assess the role of DNA methylation in regulating the inflammatory cytokine expression in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing neonates with LOS (n=42) before and after 72 hours of antibiotic treatment (n=25) to healthy controls (HC) (n=42). We analysed DNA methylation patterns and inflammatory cytokine expression levels in both groups. RESULTS: DNA methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation in pro-inflammatory genes and hypermethylation in anti-inflammatory genes in LOS neonates. These patterns were shifted in follow-up group, with significant changes in inflammatory marker levels, including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta. The gene expression results aligned with the DNA methylation findings, indicating that changes in the expression of inflammatory genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) are influenced by DNA methylation. The results were further validated through an analysis of plasma cytokine levels. LOS cases showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, except IL-10. In the follow-up group, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Understanding these molecular changes could lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for managing neonatal sepsis."
41668763,Mechanistic and therapeutic dimensions of DcR3-mediated immunomodulation in sepsis.,2025,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dysregulated host-immune responses, progressing through hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive stages. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a soluble member of the TNF receptor superfamily, serves as an immunomodulator in sepsis. Beyond neutralizing FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A to block apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, DcR3 regulates macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and immune cell survival through its heparan sulfate proteoglycan-binding domain. Evidence from cellular, molecular, and animal studies highlights its dual role in restoring immune balance by modulating both hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases of sepsis. In this review, we summarize current evidence on DcR3 in sepsis and discuss translational challenges and future directions. Current rodent models lacking the TNFRSF6B gene are limited; however, transgenic mice expressing human DcR3 exhibit both protective and detrimental context-dependent effects. Translational challenges include the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of recombinant DcR3, although strategies such as PEGylation, nanoparticle encapsulation, and hydrogel delivery may improve its efficacy. Combining DcR3 with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or immunometabolic agents like metformin and dimethyl itaconate presents promising therapeutic potential. Future research will focus on CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in mouse models, multi-omics mapping of DcR3 signaling, and biomarker-guided dosing. Although no DcR3-targeted clinical trials in sepsis have been conducted, DcR3 remains a precision-targeted immunotherapy with mechanistic and translational pathways; this review delineates key knowledge gaps that must be addressed to enable future clinical application."
